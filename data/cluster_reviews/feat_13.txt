i absolutely love this along with the lotion/toner
it is super lightweight on my skin unlike most lifting creams
there are a lot of great moisturizers out there
this is one of the best moisturizers i have used in a long time
this is a nice eye cream
i love this cream.
no moisturizer or anything
even with nice lotions i need something more now
this is an excellent face lotion the recovery cream will bring life back to your skin
my nivea moisturizer wasn't doing much to correct it
woke up with moisturizers
this is one thing i believe will be a nessesity in my skincare routine
basically the perfect moisturizer for my skin that is always red
i love this cream!
i read about this cream
had just finished over using my retinol cream
this cream is everything!
i don't think i've found a moisturizer i like more than this
it's like a cream rather than lotion
i got the sample of this moisturizer.
some moisturizers can be
this moisturizer went on smoothly
i found it to be a nice moisturizer for under my makeup
im in love with this moisturizer.
i love this as an eye cream
i love this moisturizer!
truly the best face cream.
have gone back to my clinique moisturizer
this cream is amazing.
this is the best all in one moisturizer with gentle anti aging benefits
evening skincare routine for my age
his skin has transformed we use the indigo moisturizer
sensitive skin loves this on top of their moisturizers
i've loved your facial cream for a long time.
i also want a moisturizer that brightens
i of course used my regular moisturizer afterwards
just the peeling alone seems like it is a good exfoliator
i applied my moisturizer
will absolutely make this a part of my skin care regimen
i don't need an additional moisturizer with it
i follow up with a moisturizer as needed.
then in the morning i only use one pump then moisturizing cream afterwards
the only thing it doesn't do is moisturize
this moisturizer feels slightly sticky when first applied
no peeling when i use this in the morning under my moisturizer
you apply it underneath a moisturizer or wear alone
much better than the prescription gels/creams i was given
with the murad serum i don't really even need lotion
excellant for my skin love the feeling boosts my moisturizing cream would recommend this to anyone
dry winter days under my normal moisturizer
best under eye massage with eye cream.
just this serum mornings and at bedtime.
i don't overdo it with eyeshadow brushes
followed by a moisturizer or oil
i even think oily skinned people might like it as a gel moisturizer
layers well with other products such as moisturizer
a moisturizer alone isn't enough
added fab's moisturizer to the mix
i then use the fab face moisturizer
i don't have to use a moisturizer anymore.
just this and some sunscreen and i'm good to go.
if i'm going to wear makeup i put the coconut smoothie primer by fab over this
i primarily used this at night before applying my moisturizer
this feels great to put on right before moisturizer
this moisturizer literally sinks into the skin asap
the moisturizer is a very close runner up
i started using this serum every morning under my moisturizer
it's easy to be blended into the fab moisturizer or serum or some other moisturizers
this product combined with my favourite moisturizer has been a lifesaver
during winter i did need a more intense moisturizer afterwards
all serums should come like this
its a great not-too-pricey option to boost a moisturizer ur using by layering this beneath it
you have to use a moisturizer after
i would smother my skin with moisturizers
i needed an am moisturizer that was light for my combo skin
moisturizer without leaving me oily
while i'm applying eye cream
i apply my mattifying moisturizer
enhances my moisturizer 100% times more when i use them together
works well with fab facial moisturizer
i follow with a spf moisturizer
i follow with my cerave pm moisturizer
i think i used every moisturizers under the sun until i walked into sephora
before you apply any moisturizer
it compliments any moisturizer i use.
this is the first moisturizer in my years that i've found
then finish with moisturizer
it layers very well with my sunblock
paired with the fab moisturizer
is all around a good moisturizer
paired with fab ultra repair moisturizer my skin feels amazing
my skin was very dry this winter even though i was using a heavy moisturizer
don't expect this to a moisturizing step in your routine if you have drier skin
i used in combination with a moisturizer for my combination skin
using this along with moisturizer
toner has my skin looking younger
in conjunction with your favorite moisturizer
my concealer applies sooo nicely
works well underneath my nars creamy concealer.
i used this as a serum type treatment under my normal moisturizer
usually i have to use both lotion
with this serum i only need lotion
feel i don't need to since i started using the serum in combination with my fresh black tea moisturizer
decided to try the corset cream
awesome addition to my skincare.
i don't know if it is this or the firming corset cream that makes a difference
in the daytime underneath my sunscreen
i never wore sunscreen
act as a wonderful base for moisturizer
i make sure to let it dry 15 minutes before applying moisturizer
creates a good base for concealer
it moisturizers my under eyes
perfect for keeping my concealer on all day
helps my concealer go on smoothly!
i prefer other eye creams though
i don't think its been working well with my foundation/concealer
one of my favorite eye creams!
moist for my concealer application
after applying my concealer
which i personally love as i feel like my concealer really adheres to it
i feel like my under eye concealer lasts much longer throughout the day since i started using this cream
this is the best eye cream i've found for daytime use
it's great for priming before concealer/color corrector
i've bought every expensive concealer
realized it wasn't the concealers problem--it was the eye cream
i can apply my concealer directly after using it.
reduced puffiness means i can use concealer to hide the circles
since it's not greasy the concealer goes on better
it's perfect to apply a few minutes before concealer
i really like this eye cream
this eye cream works so well.
i didn't think i needed a daytime eye cream
looks fantastic under concealer
makes concealer go on great
i do wait a couple of minutes for the product to absorb before i apply my concealer
i love this eye cream
this is the best eye cream i've ever used
play nicely with concealer
love applying with my nighttime face gel
i've always had a problem with my under eye concealer looking crepey
i've stopped using concealer under my eyes
it does not do what a concealer can do
this is a great day eye cream!
make it impossible to use concealer in my under eye area
absolutely love this eye cream.
it pairs wonderfully with my undereye concealer
amazing as a base for concealer
the eye cream does work for my undereyes
i love this eye cream.
concealer blends beautifully over top
i highly recommend this eye cream to someone who is starting out with eye creams
it feels great under concealer and does brighten.
i am almost done my first bottle of this eye cream
i love this eye cream.
i actually like the option of not having spf in my face creams
many different moisturizers in my life
this moisturizer leaves my skin dewy
purchased the face cream
i love this eye cream
i love their moisturizers
this is a great eye cream.
smooth with my nars concealer
i've tried a ton of eye creams
either way, i recommend this eye cream!
i don't use my regular face moisturizer around my eyes if i'm using this firming serum--too moisturizing
concealer to go on smoothly
great with concealer as well.
you know how some sunscreens
moisturizers with spf will leave your skin with a chalky white sheen
this moisturizer is easy to apply
this lotion is great for my combination oily/sensitive skin
i like this because it's been hard to find a daytime moisturizer with an spf of 30 or more
with this sunscreen under it
this is a very good moisturizer with very little scent
love this lightweight moisturizer.
i tend to like "thicker" moisturizers
really like this cream
then i discovered the power of a really good moisturizer
we just need to give it the moisturizer it craves
some moisturizers will cause me to break out
this moisturizer is light feeling
not at all greasy like many moisturizers with spf
s of day cream with sunscreen
it offers optimal protection from the sun without feeling like a heavy sunscreen
provides the perfect amount of moisturizer for my dry skin
i don't really get a super sunscreen smell
i wear dhc rich lotion
this moisturizer is great with the added benefit of a sunscreen
most sunscreens are greasy or heavy
i really like this face cream.
this is a great combo cream/sun protection if your skin is not sensitive
it's a little thicker than some moisturizers
its the first moisturizer to do that efficiently
this is my it cream.
it doesn't take away from the miracle that is this moisturizer
it is a good moisturizer base
even though i have oily skin i still need a moisturizer to help fight aging
i knew this must be a good moisturizer since it has the ingredients that my dermatologist told me to use including the spf 30 sun protection
this is the best moisturizer i've used.
you only need a dime size drop to moisturize the face
with an spf 30 i'm also getting great sun coverage without having to put on extra sunscreen
this is a great moisturizer
texture that regular sunscreens have
this is a great moisturizer.
it is a fabulous sunblock
i used clinique moisturizer for many years
wanted to switch to a more beneficial moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
this it's my ideal daytime face lotion providing from sun damage:
i really like this moisturizer.
especially ones with sunscreen
it has a sunscreen scent which i do like.
plus i don't have to use a sunscreen
this perfecting day cream is just right
love this day cream.
i think this is one of the best moisturizers with spf
this moisturizer not only has the amount of spf we all need
two of my favorite night creams are murad perfecting night cream
age-balancing night cream
i looked into a ton of night moisturizers/creams
it takes a good product to break an addicition to my guinot moisturizers
i found it in this nightime moisturizer
for some reason i never used any of their night moisturizers
i will keep using this cream.
it's a really lovely lotion that feels great on.
i like this night cream
so even though the “perfecting night cream" was a good cream
this is excellent for combo skin that needs some hydration because of its texture which is somewhere between a lotion
of cream for my face
i love this night cream
my favorite night cream
i recommend this cream to all mothers with normal skin
to the point where i've been able to cut back on my concealer usage
i always apply an eye cream after.
texture that shows under my concealer
use a moisturizer after applying.
i recommend putting it on before or after your moisturizer
have been using wrinkle cream for it
i applied this mask underneath my night time moisturizer
i put a tiny amount on just like a lotion
slapping some moisturizer on i would apply this
for a cream i would try it
i then put a moisturizer over it
spend a lot on serums and creams.
i wear it every morning under my moisturizer
i just took enough to cover my face like a moisturizer
i definitely prefer this over wrinkle creams if you want instant results
have spent the extra money on botox
my only complain is that it doesn't moisturize.
you still need to use a moisturizer.
applied this in lieu of my usual serums underneath moisturizer
i only use it in the am before my moisturizer
then i pat my eye cream/moisturizer over it
i put moisturizer after use then make up
it is not a moisturizer so you are told to add your moisturizer on top of it
put moisturizer over top
use a moisturizer over the product if needed
you can apply a little moisturizer if needed.
on clean dry skin before moisturizer
then i apply my moisturizer and go about my day.
this cream is amazing!
this cream is different
great moisturizer for night.
would recommend as a nice daily cream for a skincare beginner or someone who doesn't need much help other than hydration
i feel moisturizer when i wake up.
i am super picky about moisturizers.
haven't used skin care for a couple of months after buying a moisturizer that didn't agree with my skin
night as i don't react well to creams that have sunscreen in them
this is great as a moisturizer under a cc cream or foundation
is a great skin brightener
i love this cream!
the this cream was recommended for my skin type
i love this cream!
guess i'll be spending my paycheck on face creams
i can say it is a great moisturizer
this moisturizer is an absolute game changer.
this keeps your skin moisturizers all day.
i do go for regular facials once a week
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used.
this moisturizer is a dream come true.
perfect as a night cream.
during the day my moisturizer of choice is ren evercalm global day cream
this moisturizer definitely makes my skin feel
this is one of the best moisturizers!!
this is by far the best moisturizer i have ever used
i've used other 'anti aging' moisturizers that i've liked
i elected to get a 10 day sample of this moisturizer
i try different moisturizers
this moisturizer gives my skin an all day
i will be buying it as a moisturizer
this moisturizer is absolutely amazing
this eye moisturizer rocks!!!!!
this eye moisturizer is the only moisturizer i know of that you can put on eyelids
is not heavy under concealer
i used the shiseido benefiance eye cream for a while
makes my under eye concealer go on smooth with little creasing
this was my first time using a retinol
i love that this is a retinol you can use every night
before adding this to my skincare routine my skin was dull
so that you can layer up your serum + moisturizer combo
it's a very gentle retinol but i do see results.
you can also use it essentially as a moisturizer
i am a huge believer in moisturizers.
also works well as a moisturizer.
i will return back to the korres daily exfoliator
moisturizer wasn't doing the trick
i love the luxury of having my exfoliator
clears complexion in my opinion because of the papaya in there i'd suggest wearing strong sunblock after this
i think people bought this thinking this was an exfoliator
it's good paired with the actual exfolikate exfoliator
as i get older i'm starting to invest more in my skincare
i already had a pretty good skincare routine
i only need a small amount of moisturizer afterwards
good exfoliating option for sensitive skin gals like me
moisturizer it works out fine
t’s important to use a good moisturizer at least once a day
this is an amazing skincare item that is versatile
i put moisturizer on to help repeatedly
must follow with a good moisturizer!!
i follow up with a good moisturizer even though my skin is oily
i probably used less moisturizer than i usually do
with the help of a good moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
there is no topical cream
much less concealer to use.
this is my go-to moisturizer in the winter.
this moisturizer is exactly what i needed
it is just amazing as a moisturizer
doesn't clogg my pores like another of creams do.
in the morning i put on the moisturizer
i needed a lighter moisturizer
my skin has never looked as amazing as it does with this moisturizer
this cream is my holy grail for face creams.
one of my favorite moisturizers ever.
adding moisturizers every morning
have used the 100% argan oil as an am/pm moisturizer off
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used/purchased
this is my go to moisturizer every morning.
i've had to use hydrocortisone valerate cream for my dry skin
over top of my night moisturizer
this is my go-to winter moisturizer.
after just one use of this moisturizer
this is the first nighttime moisturizer where:
this is definitely a heavy cream
after about a week of using this moisturizer
this is an awesome moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is great for an everyday type of deal
this cream works wonders
i've tried so many high end face moisturizers
absolutely looooove this moisturizer!
this is a great moisturizer!
i incorporated this moisturizer into my new beauty regimen
totally agree with another reviewer who called this their holy grail moisturizer
this moisturizer so lightweight i feel like it sinks right into my skin
i love this cream
its more like a cream then a moisturizer
away the best moisturizer i've ever used
have always struggled finding the perfect moisturizer
i usually use the sunscreen during the day
this is one of the best moisturizers ive tried
as i really need a new moisturizer
this moisturizer is amazing at balancing my skin
this moisturizer is perfect for both night
concealer when applying my makeup
this cream is solustion for hidration
i've already got a daytime lotion with spf that i love
which is now in everything from moisturizers to makeup to hair care
literally the best moisturizer i have ever used!
then i liberally apply this moisturizer
this is the first moisturizer i've tried that's accomplished that
i love this moisturizer so much!
this is my favorite moisturizer i have ever tried
this is by far the best moisturizer.
i organ ally bought the josie maran with sunscreen lotion
it goes on like a cream
it is a great investment for your skincare routine
this mask feels more like a wipe-off moisturizer
we need to be moisturizing our precious aging pretty faces
it's also a great to exfoliate with in the morning before makeup application
this is a must in my skin care regimen
after the shower i applied a moisturizer that was included in the kit
i got a sample of this moisturizer with my beauty insider points
i hate how other exfoliators are so gentle there is no exfoliating happening just more chunky
i give my face a light spritz of water which makes the application easy
i put this on before i moisturize my body
is of vitamins c to help my skin glow after days or nights of makeup wearing
chin if i don't exfoliate for days on end
doesn't moisturize as much as i would like
i've decided just to add this stuff to my skin care regimen
it washes of any sunscreen or foundation i may have on
wear light tinted moisturizer during the day
the best face lotion ever.
so have a great moisturizer on h
this cream is amazing
acts as tinted moisturizer
it replaces my under eye concealer and bb cream.
it is not intended to be a moisturizer so you will need to apply face lotion prior
if you are dry i do recommend a moisturizer afterward
your moisturizer glides on
in conjunction with my moisturizer
i keep finding myself trying other serums
it is not intended to replace a moisturizer- it is a serum
i would use this by itself as a moisturizer
my skin usually hates moisturizers.
heavy moisturizers make me break out
lightly moisturizes before i put my moisturizer on
i pair this with the soft cream moisturizer from the same line
exfoliating then cover it with my night time moisturizer
before i apply my moisturizer
just this product followed by a moisturizer with spf
the bare haven moisturizer
i think it would be a wonderful addition to any skincare regimen
finish with bare haven moisturizer
i applied my moisturizer on after the serum
of my light weight moisturizer
helps my moisturizer penetrate faster
i really almost don't even need a moisturizer after using it
it's perfect to wear under a matte liquid lipstick
as a serum-moisturizer under makeup or over makeup as a setter/highlighter?
i tried using it as a moisturizer
then applying moisturizer over
this is my new go-to moisturizer
the sunshine oil has become my favorite moisturizer
my skin is wonderfully moisturizer in the morning
is quite the "sunshine" in my skincare routine now
helps a lot with blending in concealer
i can now wear powder blushes like i used to as well as just cream or oil based products
i put this on my cheekbones after applying the milk highlighter
after trying it the first night with my normal skincare routine i found that it left my skin plump
this will definitely be a staple in my skincare routine for a long time
applying it to the face before applying foundation or concealer is so helpful to avoid that dry
this is amazing as an all over body moisturizer.
as a moisturizer before makeup it is 100!!!!
i apply a little bit of a normal moisturizer
it got dirty with my nars bronzer/blushes
i think i've unlocked the key to the dewy look i've wanted by priming with the glossier priming moisturizer first
beneath my foundation/concealer
on its own or in combination with a cream highlighter
i've also used it on its own as a moisturizer
it's replaced my moisturizer
this has changed my eyeshadow!
i apply my eyeshadow as usual
pat it over my applied eyeshadow
dewy eyeshadow which stays put all day
even alone over moisturizer
if i do not moisturize several times a day
my new favorite moisturizer.
moisturize under my eyes in the morning
moisturize with this after taking off my makeup
as someone with dry skin this was a surprising moisturizer for me
i've started using this as a daytime moisturizer
very soothing moisturizer works really well if placed in the refrigerator before use
i wouldn't use this in place of a moisturizer though
i tried it under my eyes before applying concealer
t helped keep my concealer on for a really long time
my concealer overall blended
the only down side is that it's not really a moisturizer
are into using stuff like this before your moisturizer
my concealer applies flawlessly
it really didn't cool or moisturize my face
before bed as my daily moisturizer
this is a pretty good moisturizer for the under eyes
this moisturizer makes my skin instantly more radiant
this moisturizer is lightweight enough to go under my tinted moisturizer
normally i don't wear a moisturizer under my make up
lightweight feel of this moisturizer
i tried this moisturizer
is the perfect moisturizer for some light foundation
sits absolutely perfect on top of my regular moisturizer as an spf
my skin wasn't reacting well to my normal murad moisturizer
this lotion is my favorite!
this moisturizer changed the game for me!
this moisturizer is amazing--it keeps my skin clear
try new moisturizers from time to time
you do not apply retinol in the morning.
if you want a moisturizer you can use morning
just know that you will need a separate moisturizer for mornings
you may wish to moisturize on top of this
i absolutely adore this moisturizer.
finally found perfect moisturizer for my combination skin
use heavier moisturizer in winter months on dry areas
am switching to a heavier moisturizer for the winter
great, light weight moisturizer!
it's not heavy like some moisturizers
most good moisturizers don't
just not as a daytime lotion
i really like this moisturizer in the summer months
this moisturizer is light
it's a pretty price to pay for moisturizer
i also hate how shiny/oily most moisturizers make my skin look
love this lotion it makes my skin glow
i've tried every oil free or acne moisturizer around
nothing helped except for this murad lotion
i love this moisturizer!
i love this lotion.
it applies like a very lightweight lotion
when i realized i could buy a lotion to help combat that
i will never use another moisturizer.
this lotion is a life saver.
this lotion is light
this is the only moisturizer i can use for my skin
this lotion is perfect for my combination skin.
i like how lightweight the lotion is
this is the perfect night time moisturizer for people with oily skin
a great oil-free moisturizer at a good price point too
i find myself just duplicating a lotion
then my skin has too much lotion/skincare on it before even applying makeup
the lotion is great
this is my forever moisturizer.
one of my favorite moisturizers
this lotion does not have spf
i absolutely love this lotion!
this is the only moisturizer i use.
i will apply the lotion at 8am
this moisturizer really improved my oily skin
this lotion for night is perfection
this is my new favorite moisturizer for summer.
been able to find an effective moisturizer that gives me the needed moisturize my face needs
i would definitely recommend this moisturizer
especially when it comes to moisturizers
this is a great moisturizer if you have oily skin
i really love this moisturizer.
i wanted a daytime moisturizer that would help with my oiliness
this lotion works wonders on making my skin soft
i love this moisturizer
you do need to moisturize or your skin is dry without this
i love this moisturizer.
moisturize my dry spots at the same time
nice lightweight face lotion
this lotion really is life changing
i used this murad moisturizer in winter
i think this is a solid face lotion
i keep straying from this moisturizer
a good everyday moisturizer for the price
i decided to try this moisturizer because of the very good reviews
this is my absolute favorite moisturizer all year round
this is a really lightweight lotion
don't think of this as a moisturizer
i love this lotion so much i've been buying it in bulk
this lotion works great for me
i will continue to buy this moisturizer
most acne moisturizers feel really powerful in one way or another
it's as perfect as a lotion can be
every other moisturizer that makes my skin feel soft
i wear this as my night moisturizer over the philosophy time in a bottle serum
hard to find another moisturizer that feels
i liked this moisturizer quite a bit: it's not oily or heavy
before this i had used the clinic dramatically different gel moisturizer
my skin just looks better using this murad lotion
the skin perfecting lotion at night
then apply the skin perfecting lotion
so far - it is the best oil-free lotion for me.
although i love how good salicylic acid is clearing acne i feel as though in a moisturizer it's a bit redundant
i started using this after my dermatologist put me on a prescription cream that really dried my skin out
this lotion didn't just help
i needed a light moisturizer
i think this is the perfect moisturizer for someone with oily skin
i am in love with this moisturizer
*my last moisturizer was bare minerals for combo skin which is good
i like this moisturizer so far
this is my favorite facial moisturizer.
a lightweight moisturizer that doesn't break out my acne prone skin
i wear bare minerals eyeshadows
it's almost like a light light moisturizer
skin moisturizer goes on even better
since i've been using it before my moisturizer
if this had an exfoliator in it i would've gave five stars
if used with an exfoliator it would probably be perfect
i love the moisturizer, too.
more like sunscreen not too strong scent
i will now definitely need to try other tarte skincare products
moisturizers that weren't so expensive
i liked this moisturizer
always have to pair with a moisturizer
i did however notice how well this took off my waterproof mascara
i stay matte all day.
it reminds me of when i go for facials – the texture
i follow with the bare haven moisturizer for normal to dry skin
i also rub over my eyes to take off waterproof mascara
even takes off my mascara
great foundation for moisturizer afterwards.
a bobbi brown face mist as a super light summer moisturizer
easily fixed if you use a good moisturizer
daily touch dry skin face cream
it's my new daily moisturizer.
i am to the bottom of my first jar of this true oasis moisturizer
all other moisturizers i've used would dry out my skin
i absolutely love this light weight gel
this moisturizer sinks in quick
love the fact that it is a gel instead of a lotion
this is such an amazing light weight gel moisturizer
this is my go to summer face lotion.
it is a very light moisturizer
other moisturizers i've used either just sat on my skin
the bare haven is my warmer weather holy grail moisturizer now
this moisturizer is the best that i've ever used.
this cream is light
a lot of creams leave my face feeling greasy or as if the moisturizer doesn't set into my skin
i saw all 3 versions of this bare haven essential moisturizer at my local sephora
the lotion is pretty thick
it is a great moisturizer for my combination skin
i am loving this moisturizer.
this has been a great daytime moisturizer
this is such an incredible moisturizer.
before using this cream
i definitely recommend this moisturizer
great as a night cream
so i decided to try this moisturizer instead.
first moisturizer i've ever bought a second jar of
literally the best moisturizer of all time.
i absolutely adore this moisturizer for day or night
this is one of my top ten moisturizers.
in my quest for the perfect moisturizer
this moisturizer lasts all day
i've never found a moisturizer that is so rich!
this moisturizer is okay.
/or look into their nighttime moisturizer
i usually used expensive moisturizer for day
the most important is that it's not expensive at all compared to other gentle moisturizer with spf
i worked with the skincare specialist to select this moisturizer
breaking out with the moisturizer i was using
it's not as thick as my previous moisturizer
this moisturizer does wonders on dry
this moisturizer is amazing got a sample
the added bonus to my dewy skin was mixing olé herkernison serum to the moisturizer
before or you can mix into the moisturizer
knew it was my moisturizer
my friend bought this moisturizer
will never stop using this moisturizer!
i mix this into my moisturizer when i go makeup free
night underneath my moisturizer
i've spent a small fortune trying to find my perfect combination of skincare products
this goes on before moisturizer
i still use belif moisturizer here
now i kinda mix it in with my night time moisturizer
i think is best used with a moisturizer
used straight from the bottle or mixed with a moisturizer
it's like it gives my retinol cream an extra punch
it pairs well layered with a moisturizer
a few drops every night with your regular moisturizer
most of the time i use it as a night moisturizer or under my night cream
night rose moisturizer as well great combo
no amount of mattifying lotion or primer would help
a few drops of this oil mixed in with my moisturizer has changed my life
i've found it works best when i put a little moisturizer on top of it to help rub it in
i mix it with my regular moisturizer for an extra luxurious lotion that smells amazing
i mix this oil with my moisturizer for about a few weeks
for extra moisture at night i just mix some in with my favorite moisturizer
this lotion/oil is outstanding!
this product helps my moisturizer deep into my skin
i don't even need moisturizer after i use this
in the winter i would follow this up with a moisturizer
only an occasional under eye concealer
then i finish off with moisturizer
it's perfect for before you apply under eye concealer to highlight
refreshing gel-cream that you apply all over your eye area
this cream works wonders.
this moisturizer has really turned my skin around
i love this cream.
such an amazing moisturizer
cause i've always been afraid of moisturizers for my super oily skin
this moisturizer has absolutely changed my face
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used by far
heard moisturizer could help
it's my new everyday moisturizer!
my favorite moisturizer so far.
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is so great
which is very rare in a moisturizer for me.
best moisturizer i have used on my oily skin
this moisturizer is very nice
t only made sense that i try their moisturizer as well
so far this moisturizer only works with my skin.
i actually really enjoy this moisturizer.
i mainly use it in the morning because it moisturizers my skin
the first time i tried this moisturizer
no lotion ever seemed to work for me
i feel like this gel moisturizer still gives my skin the perfect amount of hydration for daytime wear
gross that i hate using a moisturizer
definitely use more product to cover my face than i would with my other moisturizer
i am currently very happy with my other moisturizer
this is my absolute favorite moisturizer right now
i put this moisturizer on as much as i want
after trying soooo many moisturizers
positive things to say about this moisturizer
this moisturizer has a nice lightweight gel consistency which i love
which would make you think it isn't the most moisturizing
the glam glow moisturizer i definitely wanted this one
i recent switched to this moisturizer
i've always had a hard time with moisturizers
want to try something other then a cream moisturizer
this gel moisturizer is fantastic.
it completely replaced my previous daily moisturizer
humid weather around the corner i wanted to try a gel moisturizer
usually i don't like gel moisturizers because i find them sticky
i think this is a great moisturizer.
i would use a heavier night time moisturizer
this as a day time moisturizer
it's the best moisturizer i've bought!
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
i usually hate moisturizers due to their heavy feeling
this as moisturizer after
this is a very light weight moisturizer
i love that it is a water gel moisturizer
absolutely love this moisturizer!
when i where the moisturizer alone with mascara i get so many compliments on how healthy my skin looks
this moisturizer leaves my skin absolutely soft
i mix this with my fresh super 7 complex moisturizer
i can't use my fresh moisturizer without it.
i love this moisturizer!
i absolutely love the weightlessness of this moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer
i absolutely love this gel moisturizer!
thick moisturizers make it worse
this moisturizer helped clear my skin as well as reduced my oil skin
never switching moisturizer again!!!!!!!
love this moisturizer so much!
this is my go to moisturizer !

the moisturizer is great either way
this moisturizer makes my skin feel amazing.
i crave that feeling now when using other moisturizers

or it may have been myskin got used to this moisturizer
this moisturizer has really saved me this winter
doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or tacky like other moisturizers
i love this lightweight moisturizer!
this moisturizer is my holy grail moisturizer.
this lotion is better
pretty much know when i need moisturizer
this moisturizer works well
i will be honest this is one of the first daily spf moisturizers i have tried
t is exactly the same product as the old moisturizer clinique put out
tried every eye cream
including my waterproof mascara
nothing actually got my mascara or foundation off my face
after falling in love with this cleanser i'm gonna splurge
no longer require a moisturizer after washing
moisturizer while still getting everything off
i wear a lot of mascara
it took off all my makeup including waterproof mascara/eyeliner
it looks like i have never put mascara on my eyelashes ever
give it a shot since i really loved their moisturizing oil
it goes remove your make even your waterproof mascara with your highest pigmented eyeshadow
this is also without using the matching oil moisturizer
mascara felt my skin so soft
i started applying it like all other moisturizers i have used
the moisturizer is thick
i love this cream.
my makeup didn't puddle like it has with other moisturizers
it is definitely one of the best creams i have ever used
i think this is a great moisturizer.
a power radical new age cream moisturizer
a lot of moisturizers feel heavy
plus i've had to use less concealer because this has evened out my skin
i love the way it moisturizers my skin all day.
the quality i like best is that it moisturizes my face for hours
usually i put moisturizer on
i like the texture of the moisturizer it feels light
i started this cream at night after exfoliating like crazy
this cream is a great skin moisturizer
this rna cream is my holy grail cream
i love the feel of this moisturizer
this is slightly lighter than the essential power moisturizer
best lotion i have ever used.
the rna power radical new age essence moisturized my skin so well i didn't need to use a moisturizer on top
the moisturizer takes a bit of time to absorb
i am a pretty conscious person about my skincare
this is definitely high quality luxe skincare serum
could add on top my sunscreen
under eye concealer was the hardest thing for me
i won't be needing much concealer today!
my concealer application is way better after using them
love this am gel cream
i felt like i got botox
my concealer applied so much smoother
my concealer hardly creased on me
looks fantastic under concealer/makeup
this is the only moisturizer that helps
give my concealer a good base
i love this eye gel.
use an eye cream first in my routine
actually pretty new to finding a good skincare routine
found that my concealer went on a lot smoother
i love this eye gel
the comfort of my concealer throughout the day
and it works so well under makeup/eyeshadow!
i put this on right before i apply my under eye concealer
just because i think this one is less moisturizing than that
also my concealer doesn't crease as much.
this eye cream is amazing
lightweight morning eye cream
it doesn't wear well under concealer
gives a perfect canvas for your concealer
i love this eye cream.
doesn't make my makeup cakey
a great daytime eye cream.
i apply this gel
i hate eye creams
the gel is even better
i really like this gel-cream formula.
all of my skincare is now fab
i do get my facials
mostly i do them myself using boscia exfoliating peel
nude skincare is amazing!!!
this is a great moisturizer with anti-aging properties
i think nude skincare products are awesome
before the ibuki refining moisturizer
they're not using sunscreen
you must use sunscreen in conjunction with any dark spot/acne mark lightening products or else the uva
if you use sunscreen on a daily basis
layered under my moisturizer well
sometimes i find that using this serum along with the shiseido brightening emulsion before bed with the humidifier on is the best way to go
this moisturizer is perfect for combination skin.
my new favorite daytime moisturizer!
did not take my matte lipstick as easily like this one
it takes all of those waterproof mascara
it even works for mascara and eye makeup.
use this product as my moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
supple even after using my extremely drying meds which no other moisturizer could do even that of one from the dermatologist
i really liked this gel like moisturizer
then i seal it in with my moisturizer
i don't really need foundation just concealer.
this overnight moisturizer is wonderful!
i think for those seeking a moisturizer that is lighter formulation
find that water-based moisturizers aren't quite enough for my skin
t's perfect for a little winter pampering
i love this cream
i don't like lotion
this balm is amazing!
soft this cream is
some moisturizer after washing my face
i've had trouble finding a moisturizer that adds a natural glow
the rest of the time i just use the lotion
assuming you aren't using it as your daily moisturizer
i applied this cream as a substitute for my usual moisturizer to see how it worked
i adore this stick highlighter.
the cap bronzer color was quite light when put onto the skin
more of a fun pop of light shimmer than a bronzer
i would buy this just for the lotion alone
it can also be used alone as a tinted moisturizer
i used this product as a moisturizer
i love how the cap includes a pretty golden cream highlighter
then just add concealer wherever i need it
i love the highlighter in the cap.
it works as a primer for your powder highlighter.
end up using it as an eyeshadow to make my eyes really pop
while i haven't used the highlighter as much as the cream itself
i like using it on its own over my moisturizer
i like to use two pumps in my moisturizer to brighten up as a first step
i did not think it was hydrating enough for me to wear without another moisturizer underneath
i wish there was more highlighter.
i see myself running out of the highlighter before the cream
his moisturizer is the perfect base for glowy makeup
i appreciate that you get a generous amount of moisturizer in the tube
this moisturizer is nice, but not life changing.
i am obsessed with this product i use it as a highlighter
i like to apply the lotion all over my skin like a primer
then dab the creme highlighter on to the high points of my face
i like to apply the crème highlighter on the tops of the cheekbones
i like to mix it with my spf moisturizer
i found myself using the flip cap more then the moisturizer
it is a great highlighter also.
this moisturizer is the perfect base for glowy makeup
i appreciate that you get a generous amount of moisturizer in the tube
this moisturizer is nice, but not life changing.
i do see better results when using it on top of my foundation or concealer
theres no excuse for not hydrating your skin.
i absolutely addicted to highlighter
the illuminating lotion is great alone
i recomend it to anyone who likes moisturizers with just a little touch of tint of color
i used a plain moisturizer
also the tip of the tube has a bronzer which comes super h
i also like to apply only to the under eye area under concealer to really amp up the hydration
this moisturizer gives me a great complexion by itself
not like i'm wearing bronzer
it's definitely not a substitute for an moisturizer
i really do wish the bronzer part popped up
the bronzer on the cap is very convenient
i used it in place of my normal moisturizer
it is a lotion that can be used all over your face that has a touch of bronze color
this lotion does give you a dewy look
under concealer or foundation
the lotion/cream illuminator in the tube gives a very very sheer wash of golden dewy color
it is not a highlighter
it isn't a highlighter either
$42 dollars for a very thin moisturizer??
i also loved the highlighter.
i really like the moisturizer
it's a nice cream highlighter
the moisturizer took my skin to a whole new level of fresh
then putting the "lotion" on top
i just add concealer
this lotion is great to use alone under foundation
the glowing moisturizer mixed great with my foundation
the little extra bronzer in the cap is awesome.
moisturizer + glow, does it get any better?
i love the moisturizer
i always need to moisturizer
i used this as a cream highlighter on my cheek bone
i've mixed a little with my moisturizer for an all over glow
either over a moisturizer or in place of my moisturizer
arm muscles etc are perfect locations for application of this nice lotion
i mixed this in with my moisturizer with a little face oil
i love this highlighter so so much!
i love this cream!
i used this after moisturizer with a little blush
as a highlighter it's amazing
one of the best highlighters for your skin
i work best with cream
depending on the day i mix a little with my moisturizer
but as a highlighter, it is amazing!
i do use this as a cream/primer
this is by far the best moisturizer that i have ever used
i am nervous to say this is my new holy grail moisturizer
this is amazing eye gel cream.
i received a sample of this eye gel/cream
i definitely recommend this eye cream!
this eye cream is going to be my new go-to cream.
i've tried a lot of different moisturizers
this moisturizer is amazing!
use other moisturizers in the morning/under my make up
it is a really nice moisturizer
almost as if it were a water moisturizer
which i am amazed at given past experiences with other moisturizers
scent of this moisturizer as much as i love the way it works
this was probably the first decent moisturizer i really used
that said, it is a good moisturizer.
this moisturizer gives me motivation to wash my face on a regular basis just
best moisturizer i've tried so far!
i hope their whole line of rose skincare is around forever because this moisturizer took my dry skin
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer works all day to keep dry patches at bay
i cannot rave enough about this moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer so much!!
this moisturizer drastically improved my skin after one use
this moisturizer has changed my whole life
i started using this moisturizer
when i've had to use another moisturizer 1
i doubt i'll ever use another moisturizer ever again
it is more than i would pay for a moisturizer though
recently tried a sample of this moisturizer from sephora
similar moisturizer without the smell
this moisturizer is absolutely amazing!
coconut free thicker moisturizer
this has been a great switch up from my normal moisturizer
this is a heavy moisturizer
i do not wear any foundation or concealer
this moisturizer is great
i love this cream.
i would caution that if you are sensitive to fragrance in your moisturizer this is not the product for you
i love this cream
this is the best moisturizer around
i've never been happier with a dace cream/moisturizer before
this moisturizer worked really well for me.
i absolutely love this moisturizer
this moisturizer is quite gentle
moisturize the skin on my face as it was quite sensitive after the the boscia sake moisturizer
this is one of my favourites moisturizers!
i really needed a good moisturizer for my face
i picked this cream
this cream is so lightweight
it doesn't add that extra oiliness that other moisturizers do
i really like this cream.
this cream is so far the best cream i have ever used
this cream is perfect for winter
this gel moisturizer is perfect for my slightly sensitive
i've tried all the best selling moisturizers
if a moisturizer is too heavy
will turn red/bumpy from a lot of gel moisturizers
this creme is absolutely amazing
low in behold i found it in fresh rose moisturizer
this cream is great.
low for a good face lotion/cream
such a great everyday face cream!
absolute favorite moisturizer at the moment!
this moisturizer saved my make up routine.
this is a perfect cream for my combination skin.
i just wanted another heavier moisturizer for dealing with winter
this is my new favorite night time moisturizer.
this face cream is light
moisturizers are always subjective
my concealer goes on flawlessly
still an effective moisturizer
i can see this being a staple product in my skincare regimen
i've used almost every eye cream
it works well under my tinted moisturizer
my concealer applies better as well
just picked it because i love eye creams
i did feel burning when i applied it after my sunscreen
concealer goes over it like a dream
my current favorite moisturizer!
that's where my fab moisturizer jump in to save the day face oil
let's moisturizer or makeup go on better
love this for a base moisturizer
if you hate heavy moisturizers or are quite oily
i hate the feeling most moisturizers leave on my skin
then i applied a light moisturizer on top
this product is perfect for layering under a second moisturizer
i find it to be much more comfortable to layer two light moisturizers rather than using one heavy moisturizer
now i can't moisturizer my oily/combo skin with anything else
i put a moisturizer on top
one day i had an urge for finding a good moisturizer that i could use in between lotion
night time skincare routine solidly
this a lovely lightweight moisturizer.
you need to use a moisturizer with it
creams are far too heavy for my skin
my skin usually stings when i use a cream moisturizer
went back to my old moisturizer
gel moisturizers just didn't cut it for me
chose to steer clear of other gel-like moisturizers
this moisturizer is a holy grail for me
still have to layer this with a cream moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
for me was perfect because i can't use rich moisturizers
just before my moisturizer
though very much into skincare i have never been able to use a proper moisturizer
i truly love this gel moisturizer.
my new favorite moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer i use now
26/dry/acne prone/sensitive this stuff is amazing as a skincare addict i have never found a lotion like this it's perfect to use after my oils
i know that i'm supposed to use a moisturizer as a final step in my skin card routine
so you know this hydration gel/moisturizer is nothing less than amazing
it's not meant to be a moisturizer on its own
it's meant to go on before moisturizer to add a boost of hydration
i recommend it if you have very dry skin or skin that needs a little extra comfort from drying acne or retinol products
i am very particular about the texture of my moisturizers
what it is is a really good serum to go under a moisturizer
i tried it as just a moisturizer
applied a dedicated moisturizer on top
this is a really good product to layer under moisturizer
this one i use during the day as my moisturizer
normally i wouldn't like a moisturizer that i must follow with a moisturizer
other than that this is not meant to be your moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer.
lala moisturizer at night
this moisturizer isn't "intensive"
just for reference i do not use this as a moisturizer
use it in conjunction with other serums or moisturizers i think it's great
alone moisturizer for me
great to layer under make up or moisturizer
this is the moisturizer for you
i think this would work very well for combo/oily skin as a daytime moisturizer
follow w a heavier moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i have ever tried
before my regular moisturizer
i'll use a cream moisturizer on top when traveling to super dry climates
purchased this moisturizer this past summer because of both the great reviews
i really like this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is the best gel moisturizer i have tried
prefer to wear it as my daytime moisturizer
of all the moisturizers i have used this is for sure the best for combo skin
at one point i was using two moisturizers
i don't notice it once i put my sunscreen over it
i enjoy all the philosophy moisturizers so far.
this gel cream/moisturizer is my holy grail!
the belif moisturizer felt so heavy on the skin
its also very good as a day moisturizer.
oily-looking than my more heavy-duty moisturizers
my mom uses the philosophy hope in a jar moisturizer
or this product for a basic moisturizer
nothing compares to this face moisturizer
i've tried so many moisturizer
so... are we all smelling the same moisturizer???
i love this and the eye cream for day moisture.
this moisturizer makes your skin breathe
don't always get around to a my skincare routine
treatments that can be very drying so having a good moisturizer is essential
this is the only moisturizer i've been able to use on my skin that feels fresh
use it's sister moisturizer that has an spf in it in the spring/summer
i really like how it moisturizer my dry skin
this moisturizer is something heaven sent.
i found this gel cream thick
although this wouldn't suit my skin as a regular moisturizer
it's a great light weight moisturizer
it go away after the moisturizer being absorbed
i generally use super light moisturizers
if you need light moisturizing then i think this product will work for you
this moisturizer is my absolute favorite.
i don't even use the other moisturizers at all anymore
it is a perfect moisturizer for her oily skin
my experience with this moisturizer has been nothing
for my night moisturizer it feels very fresh
loved the philosophy gel cream
best thing i've used on my face besides other moisturizers this is one of the best
i instantly fell in love with this moisturizer
i am not all into moisturizers
over doing it with my moisturizer
i love this moisturizer because it does the job without feeling like i caked on moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer.
i think it moisturizers a little better
i love to try out new moisturizers
i am absolutely obsessed with this gel cream!
my esthetician recommended a gel moisturizer over a cream for my skin
this moisturizer really does the trick
this is my new holy grail moisturizer!!!
my skin almost felt like i didn't need moisturizer afterwards
after washing my face i apply my moisturizer • then keep young
i also use it as a primer/moisturizer under my nars matte tint foundation
you'll need to moisturize first
i am using nars radiant creamy concealer after putting on the nars sheer glow foundation
actually sets my concealer
i feel that you can use this over any concealer
after purchase i was wondering why it wasn't moisturizing
directions say to use a moisturizer before!
you need to then follow with moisturizer
i then dab a light moisturizer over it
it is not an eye moisturizer.
of course you should use it with a proper moisturizer
the cream is super light
i'll probably buy a jar when i finish off my moisturizer
so i decided to give this gel cream a try, man!
i know it says double lotion
plump that i don't ever want to be without it in my skincare routine
i personally use this in place of a traditional moisturizer
moisture before i go in with my night moisturizer
i don't use a heavy moisturizer every day
i gave it a shot one day in place of my aloe moisturizer
she made me a sample of this lotion to try.
this lotion plumps up my skin so well
i follow it with my moisturizer
skipped the in betweens just using a moisturizer
not even have to use a moisturizer although i still do
the use of the word "lotion"
it is not a moisturizer
rather to help your moisturizer absorb better
in place i'll use a mattifying lotion with spf since this product would eventually make my skin worse
this is not meant to be a moisturizer on its own
moisturizer is a must with this product
i usually use a belif moisturizer because it's light
i feel like it just works for me on days that i don't feel like adding a lotion-like moisturizer
use this as my moisturizer
even with a light gel moisturizer
this yuza double lotion is absolutely perfect for my summer face
i jumped on the sephora app to see if they made a body lotion
before i apply the rest of my skincare
i mix it with my daily moisturizer and viola!
it's not a moisturizer so you still need to moisturize
i wait for it to completely dry before placing moisturizer on
you should put moisturizer on afterwards
lots of sunscreen cause my face to break out
i think it's because a moisturizer is not added after applying the elixir like the directions suggest
even with moisturizer or vaseline
it makes my skincare work better
id been using pore tightening morning/night moisturizer
after applying my moisturizer
you can apply your moisturizer
once it's dried apply your moisturizer.
this serum has done wonders for my skin.
feel like i've tried almost every aging serum under the sun
so make sure to use a moisturizer after.
this is one step in my skincare regimen that i never skip
i apply it before my moisturizer
creams it seems to be making a difference
even my waterproof mascara
i really liked the mascara
the eye cream is light
i love the eye cream
i still apply primer before applying concealer.
the eye cream is fun size so that makes the eyeliner
keeps my concealer from creasing
the mascara wears really well.
i love the mascara.
mascara is the regular travel size that comes in a lot of the clinique products
my concealer doesn't crease with it
i like this eye cream for the mornings before i use concealer
this product does not affect the application of my concealer at all
the eye cream is okay.
it's just a simple eye moisturizer.
the mascara is good doesn't flake.
i enjoyed the eyeliner
the mascara is the winner in this lot.
is not a life changing eye cream
i've tried so many moisturizers
it does everything i need in a moisturizer
i can't use this moisturizer in the morning
this is one of the few moisturizers i can actually tolerate
under clinique pep start sunscreen in the morning
i hate scooping out the moisturizer
the facialist told me i had very dry skin
needed a good moisturizer to incorporated in my routine
this moisturizer was recommended to me.
this moisturizer did not leave me with an oily forehead in the morning
like most night creams do
i'd rather use light weight serums.
i'll keep this short: buy this moisturizer
is the best face cream i've ever used
this moisturizer is light and very effective.
this is by far my favorite evening moisturizer!!!
i got a deluxe sample of this moisturizer in a set
one of the best moisturizers i've ever tried!
i love this lotion.
it's my absolute favorite lotion.
this along with the ceo lotion in the am is amazing
these lotions are wonderful
every other moisturizer made me break out
this cream is amazing
just put sunscreen on after it for extra added protection
i've had my share of moisturizers
i give this cream a 4
this lotion does not make me break out or increase oiliness
it was a good moisturizer
have been searching for the perfect daily moisturizer since college
it's truly the best moisturizer i have ever tried
light-weight cream/lotion
t's kind of an all in one treatment / moisturizer which i love because i feel like i can skip using a serum
i started using this moisturizer every night after my acne clearing regimen
whenever i put this moisturizer around those area
basically this is the best hydrating moisturizer i have ever purchased
i am obsessed with this moisturizer.
this water cream is unlike any other moisturizer or any skincare product i had ever used
sometimes during the day before another moisturizer with spf
this by far one of the best moisturizers for my skin
used this as my moisturizer instead of my first aid beauty one
i then went to try another moisturizer
i love this cream
normally couldn't use a moisturizer like this
my light moisturizer just wasn't doing anything for me
i think it will be too heavy of a moisturizer for me in summer
i couldn't get a moisturizer that would do two things: moisturizer
i don't mind investing in good skincare that works
i used it under my moisturizer as well as st
i went back to using other moisturizers i have
i've honestly been trying to find a moisturizer that works with my skin for 15 years
so far it's the best moisturizer i've used
i really like this moisturizer so far.
i love this cream.
the spf will lend it to be a good moisturizer for daytime
this is the lightest face cream with sunscreen that i have tried
i am in love with this skin cream!
so far i prefer the josie maran moisturizer with spf a bit more
i love this day cream.
i love that it has spf 20 in it as well which is a must in my day time moisturizers
i love this facial moisturizer!
many sunscreens sting or make my face break out.
normally moisturizers with sunscreen break me out
i usually don't like moisturizers in the summer heat
loved the sunscreen protection
this is my absolute favorite moisturizer
n love with this moisturizer
this moisturizer has entirely changed my routine.
have to use a heavy moisturizer
as i feel it primes my skin for my moisturizer while simultaneously keeping my acne at bay
usually most of the moisturizers are heavy for my skin
sits perfectly under my moisturizer
this moisturizer may cost the equivalent of a steak dinner
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
out of the tube before application it looks like a matte moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer.
once you get the hang of applying this moisturizer
i really enjoyed using this moisturizer!
one of my favorite moisturizers.
i love this type of moisturizer.
this moisturizer isn't even close to enough hydration for me to act as the moisturizer in my daily skincare routine
i loooove this moisturizer.
doesn't leave a shiny residue like a lot of moisturizers
a really great moisturizer for humid days
then my korres wild rose moisturizer
i legit love this moisturizer.
i can honestly just wear this moisturizer day-to-day
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
best face lotion i've ever had.
i looove this moisturizer i have really oily skin
i just really love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is the best
i love this moisturizer.
then a slightly heavier moisturizer on top
ready for a light sunscreen
won't pill up under primer or foundations like other moisturizers have done on me in the past
i won't be looking elsewear for moisturizer as long as i have this
its one of the beat light moisturizer for oily acne prone skin in hot humid summer days
this is really nice, light moisturizer.
this is probably by far the best moisturizer i have tired
i hate heavy creams
i will never use any other moisturizer.
this moisturizer is very good
this moisturizer soaks in just right
probably as a morning moisturizer before i put on foundation
unlike any moisturizer i've used
none greese this one of my go to face moisturizer
not quite a gel or a cream
this will absolutely be my daily moisturizer for warmer temps
this is the best moisturizer ive tried in a long time
this is not an anti-aging moisturizer to me
best moisturizer for combo skin.
i love that this product is different than any other moisturizer that i've used
i kept applying thicker lotions
my advisor told me i needed a different kind of moisturizer now
i swear by this for moisturizer
i mean a little bit of jojoba oil first then i apply the moisturizer
this moisturizer is great
i agree with some other reviewers that it's not a miracle moisturizer for super dry skin
i am in love with texture of this moisturizer.
follow it up with a sunscreen
i don't recommend this at night as it is a light moisturizer
you're taking care of your skin at night with serums
i love putting this on before applying another moisturizer over
combine it with another moisturizer it is magical
normally my moisturizer wears off
it's such a mission finding a good moisturizer when you have oily skin
absolutely 110% the best moisturizer i have ever used
this moisturizer just works perfectly for my skin
it's cheap for a high end moisturizers
which most moisturizers make things worse
it works well as a moisturizer makeup base before your primer
this moisturizer helped with the dry flakey skin
this product is meant to be a lightweight moisturizer
overall highly recommend this moisturizer!
'm always hesitant to try different moisturizers
perfect moisturizer for combination skin!
this moisturizer is no exception
this moisturizer is great!
i can't tell you how many moisturizing creams i've tried that leave me with little pimples
this is a lovely light moisturizer suited more for summer time
it's an excellent lightweight moisturizer.
be warned: this moisturizer is definitely *not* for dry skin
this moisturizer is my holy grail
then used the moisturizer before bed
this moisturizer is a life-saver
this will be an everyday moisturizer for me
they must not be exfoliating because while light
i love this moisturizer as a primer for makeup if you have oily skin
it does give my normal moisturizer a boost when one is needed
i love everything about this moisturizer.
perfect moisturizer for day wear under your makeup
i would not recommend using this alone as your moisturizer
after applying i felt like i still needed more moisturizer
low for a lightweight moisturizer that won't ruin my makeup
this non-greasy moisturizer has a gentle
i love this moisturizer.
doesn't pill or feel greasy.
i wore it under my moisturizer
after using this i feel as though my moisturizer really soaks in
i layer it under my moisturizer
my makeup looks better since i started spending more on my skincare
t is good to use before applying your moisturizer
i once bought the eye cream
i don't even believe in eye creams
serum moisturizer work fine on my eye area
then a face cream/moisturizer
then moisturizer if you get dry.
for years i have used eye creams
now my under-eyes barely need concealer!
this eye cream is the best!!
i no longer wear under eye concealer in my everyday routine
i still needed concealer
i don't seem to need concealer anymore
i actually threw away my old concealer
i also loved to put a drop under my eyes to prevent concealer creasing
i think it might be too much for a daytime moisturizer
throughout the day i notice my skin does not seem to get as greasy or oily as using a regular lotion moisturizer
this is the 3rd step of my ever increasing skincare regimen
the new "go-to" face moisturizer
i believed i will have oily stains on my pillow after using it as night moisturizer
i love the simplicity of this moisturizer
it will probably last 2x what my normal "jar" of moisturizer would
i think that it's a pretty good facial moisturizer
i would only use this as a facial moisturizer at night though
as it seemed to be so moisturizing that my bb cream slid a bit
added my usual moisturizer to the routine
same as i did with my usual facial moisture lotion
it works wonderful as a base in the morning before applying a moisturizer with spf
it also works well by itself as an evening moisturizer
always a part of my daily skincare regimen
i recently ran out of the brightening derm moisturizer
don't normally use a moisturizer at all
i would use this over regular moisturizer everyday
in the morning i use an under eye treatment along with an spf moisturizer
sometimes a tinted moisturizer as well
a moisturizer because my skin is very dry
i am able to use this under my spf face cream
this has definitely replaced my other moisturizers
sunscreen or foundation primer
have not applied moisturizers over it as reccommended
i really like this moisturizer.
i also use their eye cream and facewash.
this is wonderful moisturizer if you have normal / dry skin
much more moisturizing than than the korres sleeping mask i just purchased
i never used to moisturize at night
i've finally found my perfect moisturizer
this moisturizer is so amazing.
okay first of all this is the best moisturizer for fines lines
the moisturizer i had used previously did not seem to penetrate my skin
this moisturizer helped my skin glow
the gel moisturizers never make me break out
in the winter go with a pretty heavy moisturizer that i love
mother that moisturizer is key
obsessed with this moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
the best moisturizer i have ever used
this is the most amazing moisturizer i have ever tried
i decided to try this lotion
this moisturizer has brought my skin back to life
this is my favorite daytime moisturizer.
great moisturizer for day time use.
it is better than a moisturizer
i always look for a good moisturizer
i still use a moisturizer over it to get that extra hydration
this moisturizer has changed my skin
the formula is like a gel-cream
good light every day moisturizer.
smoother than my other eyeshadow primers
i've also tried 10 different eyeshadow primers trying to figure out what's going on
my eyeshadow stays exactly where it should be
i tried some after sun creams
then a moisturizer to kind of seal the deal
i don't usually get sunburn because i'm diligent about using sunscreen
the best part about is it that i can put concealer or eye shadow on
does not make concealer or foundation slide off under the eye
-makes my concealer stick with no creasing.
often times concealer couldn't even cover them up
my under eye is still too dry for a smooth finish cream contour or concealer
my foundation glides over it as does my concealer
good pick me up in the morning with face moisturizer
patches that often show up with my concealer
helps my concealer go on smooth
this eye balm is pricy
i love this mostly because it helps my concealer to go on smoothly
definitely helps with my 42 year old undereye bags
this is an incredible eye balm/eye cream!
i love this eye balm.
so this is a light weight balm
definitely a staple in my skincare routine now!!
while i agree this isn't the most moisturizing product i've ever used
i started with their shea moisturizer
i can't live without their moisturizer
this doesn't sink into skin like a moisturizer would
normal skins can mix a small amount into their usual moisturizer or oil or apply a moisturizer to dry areas only
i realized not all moisturizer fixes dry skin problem
before my night moisturizer
i apply my moisturizer
i don't remember seeing anything about it being exfoliating
mixed in with my moisturizer
or how strong my deodorant promised to be
kept a travel deodorant on me at all times
this is my holy grail out of all the moisturizers that i have tried
i apply a thin later of moisturizer to my face right after
not enough to skip moisturizer
i'll layer a moisturizer on top
this doesn't pill off my face
this is a great lightweight moisturizer.
i also put a lotion moisturizer on top to keep my face hydrated
it moisturizers just enough for me.
ive tried so many lotions to wear under makeup
i've tried so many different moisturizer
t is not overly heavy i would say it is a light face lotion for hydration
i would definitely recommend using a separate night cream heavier lotion for nighttime
exfoliate then use this, you'll love it
i just add a little dab to body lotion or sunscreen
absolutely love this moisturizer
it is a awesome product you could use with sunscreen
this moisturizer isn't too heavy.
i recommend this to anyone who needs an everyday moisturizer
when i applied the moisturizer on my face
as it is a really nice moisturizer
would recommend a good moisturizer after
most of the time this is moisturizing enough that i can skip a moisturizer
spf 30 moisturizer from the same line
this is the sunscreen for oily to combination skin
as a sunscreen this stuff is great.
is a little sticky feeling over a thick moisturizer
best of all face sunscreens.
no white sunblock residue.
i love this sunscreen.
moisturizer packed in one
probably from the hybrid serum/moisturizer
i love this serum/moisturizer combo.
since it's winter i still add a moisturizer on top
moisturizer in one because i use it in the mornings
if you are used to cream moisturizers
this is nowhere near as hydrating as the cream ones
i always forget that gel-creams are the best texture for my combination oily skin
i apply a less moisturizing sunscreen or bb cushion on top
overall this is a good moisturizer for dry skin.
how much fun are little jelly-like cream beads to use as moisturizer???
i wanted to see what this moisturizer was all about
this would work beautifully as a daytime moisturizer under makeup
i like my makeup matte
i now use it after my moisturizer to retain the effects of said moisturizer
helps makeup application so that your concealer
u probably should add moisturizer after or before
jelly pack is my new favorite skincare item!
i can't still skip the moisturizer
even if i only stick a cc cream or tinted moisturizer on top
it's honestly more like the perfect moisturizer before applying foundation
i apply a moisturizer first
found with my 8 step skin care it works beautifully as a morning moisturizer after my my serum
one onto my skin after moisturizer
i put my moisturizer on first
yes that's right you want it to be sticky so that your foundation or bb or cc cream or moisturizer adheres well
my tinted moisturizer goes on even better
i set foundation with a spray to give a dewy look
i notice that my sunscreen
moisturizer before i put this on
well after using this product say goodbye to my under eye concealer crease
i mix this with another nighttime moisturizer
i now just use my moisturizer after
puts some fun into my skincare regimen
should definitely come towards the end of your skincare routine
/or concealer since buying this
sometimes i use it in place of a moisturizer
am always in search of new great moisturizers to try
i don't normally skimp on skincare
if you follow with a good moisturizer it's all good
i applied it after my moisturizer
i apply this after moisturizer
the lotion is quite nice too for every other day use
i've found that it sits really well under josie maran's daily moisturizer with spf
love it mixed with my moisturizer
hydrates the under eye beautifully so that if i wear concealer it isn't flakey
i read about this eye cream
makes it a smooth base for my concealer
my concealer was looking creasy
this eye cream is moisturizing without being too thick for day time or makeup application
i really love this moisturizer!
it's the perfect everyday moisturizer that doesn't make the skin extra oily or dry
this product is my new favorite eye cream.
this moisturizer is perfect for my oily areas daily use
my "old" moisturizer was purchased at a medical spa
this moisturizer is amazing.
this is more than i normally like to spend on moisturizer
00 for a moisturizer is expensive
you need "deep hydration" in your moisturisers this won't be your winter go to
i like this moisturizer just fine
i love this moisturizer!
a lot of fragrance in my face moisturizer
this moisturizer is phenomenal lightweight
this moisturizer is amazing!!
the best moisturizer i've ever tried!
this moisturizer changed my skin.
this new moisturizer from dr perricone is incredible
providing a super smooth base before i apply my concealer
this oil free moisturizer will knock your socks off
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used!
i always look for an oil free moisturizer that gives me enough hydration
this cream is my number one cream!
during the summer i like light day creams
i really like this moisturizer
this lotion is amazing.
this moisturizer is wonderful!
this moisturizer does not aggregate my skin
as an eye cream
this cream is great
i love this cream!
while my skin is wrinkle free despite my fair skin tanning in my youth
this moisturizer is no joke
it also keeps my skin moisturizer all day
i literally can't be without this moisturizer.
tried so soo many moisturizers
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
it also plays nice with my sunscreen
this is a very nice moisturizer
what i also like about this moisturizer is that it doesn't have all these 100 + promising ingredients
to me this moisturizers seems easy
it is a very good moisturizer
have been on the hunt for a great moisturizer
this moisturizer is so clean
this is my favorite night moisturizer for my combo skin
i love this cream
perfect on top of my serums
this is a great moisturizer for overnight application
i enjoy using this cream
the price is really steep for this moisturizer
my old skincare regimen was breaking me out
i actually like this cream i have combination skin
i am crazy about this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is seriously a dream!
this moisturizer is awesome!!!
i tried so many different moisturizers
i love to splurge on skincare!
the moisturizer i was using had dramatically moisturized my skin
this moisturizer doesn't leave your face oil
the moisturizer itself definitely has a rich feeling to it
this is the best moisturizer i have used so far.
i highly recommend this moisturizer
cut down on the use-age of all my moisturizers
this moisturizer works wonders!
i really enjoy this moisturizer.
this cream works wonders
nice and light feel but great moisturizer!
i love the texture of this moisturizer, so rich!
this is a great moisturizer.
i like this moisturizer
the moisturizer itself is very thick
i usually only use gel-like or very light-weight creams because of my sensitive skin
i've tried everything from coconut oil to really good moisturizers
i really loved this moisturizer
i really have tried every moisturizing cream out there
it made a perfect night cream
this cream is amazing!
using a water based moisturizer didn't help
i love this cream.
i tried a sample of this moisturizer
used some of this cream at bedtime as a way to pamper my skin
for those times when skin needs a little pampering
i applied this with just a moisturizer on top right before bed
i will only use when i need a boost in my skincare
then added my usual 3 drops of drunk elephant virgin marula luxury facial oil to the guerlain to make it a treatment/moisturizer
as a moisturizer on mornings when i haven't had enough sleep
the product in side was the moisturizer that dreams are made of
think of it as a serum highlighter.
after a moisturizer with even better results
she also gave me a sample of the oil mattifying moisturizer which i plan on
light weight simple sheer moisturizer.
apply a drug store concealer on my eyes
since it is not a tinted moisturizer
i first used it as one of my base moisturizers before foundation
i just add a bit of concealer to certain areas
this is my favorite moisturizer.
great moisturizer to add a little glow!
i mix it with my liquid bronzer so that might have something to do with it
i ran out of my normal moisturizer
i love the way this lotion looks
mixing it with my regular moisturizer works best for my skin
i don't think i will ever use another moisturizer again
i put my usual moisturizer on
then foundation or josie maran's tinted moisturizer
this is one of those moisturizers that are nice to wear when your skin is in perfect condition
if i'm going to spend 50 bucks on a small tub of lotion
this product moisturizes my skin that i can skip moisturizer some days
so this moisturizer is just right for me
i like mixing it with sunblock for a no-makeup day
i would not use this as a moisturizer
which isn't unheard of for a moisturizer
i can't imagine using this alone as a moisturizer
this is my go to moisturizer at the moment.
definitely my go to for primer and moisturizer.
i really like this moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer.
a very hard time finding a good moisturizer
on one "no make up" day i paired it with some spot concealer
sometimes i find it can ball veeerrry slightly in combination with my concealer
i moisturizer with this
it was said to be an illuminating moisturizer
just use it as a moisturizer before applying my primer
i also use it as a night time moisturizer
not a heavy moisturizer at all
i don't think this is the most moisturizing thing in the world
my favorite moisturizer i've tried for dry patchy skin
s a great product to use before applying any of your makeup as the glow from the moisturizer hydrates
just popped on some of this concealer
i don't wear foundation or concealer
was so excited to try this moisturizer
it's cheaper than my old moisturizer
with this used as my moisturizer/primer i'm only half as oily as i am at lunch
they say to wear it at night because of the retinol
then i layer my moisturizer over top
under josie maran's daily spf 47 moisturizer
i don't feel the need to put on a moisturizer after either of these oils
this is also the only oil i have found that moisturizers skin
i even like mixing it with my moisturizer before makeup in the morning
before moisturizers on my cheeks
i don't even need a daily moisturizer anymore before putting on foundation
night along with sunscreen to protect the clarity of my skin
is easily able to take in moisturizer
use a moisturizer for my dry areas
just use the oil free moisturizer and voila!
i brought it in a duo with clinque's moisturizer
does a fantastic job of taking off mascara as well
an amazing moisturizer with this cleanser
my moisturizer goes on like
i need a good exfoliator every day.
this is the best exfoliate i have ever used
50 is a good price for a solid daily exfoliator
best exfoliate ever love it
this exfoliator has really helped to clear up my skin
don't forget to apply moisturizer after!
this moisturizer is amazing
i highly enjoy this moisturizer.
even though it does say moisturizer
this moisturizer is great for it
my face feels moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer, i love it.
this moisturizer is my holy grail
in the summer months it's been perfect as a lightweight moisturizer
before bed as a moisturizer
this is more a primer than a moisturizer
this moisturizer made it so smooth
i've seen a lot of similar products lately: gel-like moisturizers that pack a lot of hydration
it works well as a moisturizer
just moisturize the heck out of my face
this hydroblur moisturizer was part of a 500 point bonus
this is the best moisturizer i've ever tried.
i usually apply my josie argan oil under any lotion moisturizer
i received the clinique pep-start hydroblur moisturizer in my sephora play beauty box
this has become my new daytime moisturizer
i see a lot of people saying it is a better primer than a moisturizer
moisturizer for your skin
it's referred to as a moisturizer
it's my new hg moisturizer
this was a great primer/moisturizer.
this has a silicone feel which i enjoy
i love this cream
it worked well as a moisturizer.
was happy to note that it was a matte moisturizer
only thing that would be a plus is a bit of sunscreen
i like the idea of a moisturizer/primer.
this moisturizer is okay
i usually use sephora's moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer that actually works well with my forehead
i usually only use a bit of concealer under my eyes
this cream is an in between of an everyday hyrdating cream
this moisturizer served as the best primer i have ever used
i see a lot of people complaining that it isn't a full moisturizer or moisturizing enough for their skin types
overall, it is a good moisturizer.
this is not the best moisturizer i have tried
i usually use the ole hendrickson sheer transformation moisturizer which helped initially improve my texture
my normal sephora intensive instant moisturizer
or philosophy miracle worker moisturizer
the moisturizer is great
i would use a heavier moisturizer at night
i would use it as a moisturizer
i always moisturizer my face again before applying make up
i've never used a moisturizer like this before.
i already have a moisturizer
this moisturizer is also quite thick
i put this stuff on much heavier than a regular moisturizer
i still have to use a moisturizer bc this is a little dry for my normal skin type
amazing under makeup as a moisturizer
i love this stuff it blends in amazingly well no need for concealer
i really like this eye cream!
this is also a great base for my sephora bright future gel serum concealer
this eye cream is amazing.
it does not pill
works wonders with under eye concealers
cooling gives a great canvas for concealer or works well with out it
i usually go for a different moisturizer after i finish each one
i decided to try this cream after using the amazing hydrating face mask
this cream does it all!
if i'm going to spend good money on a moisturizer
it's also nice as an overnight moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer ever!
this cream is magic!
this is the only moisturizer that seemed to help it all
when i say i'm never using any other type of moisturizer
i've tried so maybe different creams
i love this cream
i needed a moisturizer for awhile
as a night time moisturizer i am extremely happy with it
i just want to point out that this is an extremely heavy moisturizer
this moisturizer makes my skin look
i usually change up my moisturizer for the winter
usually apply moisturizers several times a day
not with this cream
is asking for some extra moisturizer
found that this moisturizer did the trick
it's a little on the pricey side for moisturizers
eye creams i have ever tried
it is thicker than some other moisturizers i've tried
i love that it contains 5 different firming/moisturizer products all into this 1cream
i apply the cream to my skin
i can also apply my order serums
moisturizers on top of this cream
really am loving this 5-in-1 moisturizer.
moisturizer my makeup stays on all day
it is more like a moisturizer
it used this in place of my usual moisturizer
usually can't really use moisturizer
i can't recommend this moisturizer enough
i loveeeee this moisturizer specially at night time
i usually breakout from any moisturizer i try
this is a really nice moisturizer
very pleased with this new moisturizer-- make sure to pat it on vs rubbing it in
this moisturizer / mask gives me those same effects
nothing compares to this moisturizer
being 56 i see what creams honestly do for skin texture
this lotion really works
this face cream is amazing!
this is one of the most amazing face creams i've ever used
this cream seems greasy at first
i really like this moisturizer!
this moisturizer smells amazing!!
it works well as a night time moisturizer
usually moisturizers will make me break out
this moisturizer did not do this to my skin
i normally can't even use oil-free moisturizer since my skin is so oily
mascara if i have a date
i've also tried it by adding just a touch of my own moisturizer to this product
just a little in the morning with a swipe of mascara
this moisturizer is beautiful.
looks fabulous when i apply first then apply my foundation which is itcosmetics cc+ full coverage cream in tan
this is the perfect moisturizer for the summer!
this is definitely a different kind of moisturizer
great light feeling moisturizer.
this is the perfect moisturizer for those days where your skin is looking "blah"
expensive for an eye cream
that being said, this is a $68 day moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer!
this is the best face moisturizer for oily skin!
i pair this with the sunscreen and voila!
this is the best moisturizer for my skin.
with any other moisturizer
it works well under either the sunscreen or bb cream
the tatcha water gel moisturizer at the same time
finding a daily moisturizer that works for me is a nightmare
i really love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is amazing
i love this moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer!
very good moisturizer even through dry winter months
i really like this moisturizer because its calming
it's a great under-makeup moisturizer
i think it is intended to be a moisturizer
i think skincare is a good investment
definitely my go to morning time moisturizer
this gel is so light
this is the perfect moisturizer for the hot summer months
it's a gel-like formula
i love how light this gel is.
i would purchase after my other moisturizers run out
use it under my sunscreen
it works great with the tatcha pore perfecting sunscreen
this is a lot of $$$ to drop on a moisturizer
this moisturizer is perfect for my whole face
finish with my simple moisturizer
i am absolutely obsessed with this gel moisturizer
i often get milia from moisturizers
i think it's amazing moisturizer for oily skin
if you want a moisturizer with oil control
it almost felt as if i put on a moisturizer
this moisturizer didn't make my skin oily!
i really like this moisturizer
this moisturizer is awesome for people with 'normal/combination skin'
so right before moisturizer
then follow with this product following with my moisturizer
yes i love my moisturizers
i normally use the other silky moisturizer as my daily
i find this moisturizer to be lightweight
t is hard to find a moisturizer that nourishes my face
i actually switched from using moisturizer to using this before makeup
this moisturizer kept that all in one place not to matte not to shiny the perfect combo
this moisturizer definitely controls my oil esp at night
i am in love with this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is absolutely perfect
a lot of time moisturizers that cater to oily skin leave the skin feeling matte or flat
it definitely is an amazing daytime moisturizer
this moisturizer is perfect for my oily skin during the summertime
i am on my second stick of this easy to use exfoliating stick
it felt more like a lotion
this is my dearest exfoliating product.
the formula works very well from face to underarms to bikini line
this is my new fave exfoliate.
if you follow immediately with moisturizer
hydrating i put some moisturizer on afterwards for the extra hydration i will definitely be buying the full size when i run out i love tarte products they are so amazing
it is definitely a staple in my skincare routine.
i used the tarte moisturizer after
follow up with a gentle moisturizer
it is an exfoliator so that is to be expected
tarte skincare has done wonders for my skin.
for people with dry skin just remember to use a moisturizer after i've since fallen in love with another playbox gift
moisturizer routine balanced it out just fine
this is a nice daily exfoliator especially if you have oily skin
you can feel the product exfoliating your skin as you rub it around your face
just follow with a good moisturizer!
my 9 year said oh mom that would be a gorgeous eyeshadow color
moisturizer it's like i have a new face
just moisturizer afterwards made my face look so nice
she recommended this moisturizer
i've tried a lot of moisturizers with sunscreen
this moisturizer has been a miracle worker so far
i really like this moisturizer.
s down the perfect summer moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
after trying every moisturizer under the sun
i also love a moisturizer with spf.
wanted a new moisturizer with spf
because of how the moisturizer makes my skin
s like most moisturizers do
even with the added sunscreen
this moisturizer feels great on my skin
foundation goes on well on top of this moisturizer
it doesn't have that pasty sunscreen feel
i love this moisturizer.
a little foundation or tinted moisturizer
when i tried this product out with my clinique exfoliating brush then applied my moisturizer
i also love there sunblock lotion!!
whenever i apply sunscreen lotion
after washing it off my skin feels like i just put good moisturizer
i will post the same review on the kate somerville+ retinol firming eye cream as another beauty may want to try them all
this is my go to moisturizer after cleansing
this moisturizer works for me year round.
this moisturizer definitely gets the job done.
i used this moisturizer
but this moisturizer did not do that!
my go to day &a night moisturizer!
this gel moisturizer is amazing!
i think this will be the perfect spring/summer lotion
i like to use a heavier cream
this works moisturizer for me most of the time.
otherwise this moisturizer leaves my skin still pretty dry when i use the stronger cleaners
i like this for my almost-every day moisturizer.
moisturizer that's in a pump that will keep me moisturized
this moisturizer feels so light weight
this is one of the only moisturizers that don't break me out because it has amazing ingredients
which makes it one of my favorite moisturizers rather quickly
is his first official men's moisturizer
this is the most amazing moisturizer!
reminds me of my clinique gel cream.
every moisturizer is crazy heavy
s down the best moisturizer he's ever used
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used.
this is my new go-to moisturizer.
this moisturizer is a great multi-tasker.
the moisturizer goes on with a nice cooling effect
it was a very light feeling moisturizer
this is my new favorite philosophy moisturizer.
moisturizer mix is applied you pat it on
i received this as a free sample with the uplifting miracle worker moisturizer
i received a sample of this along with the philosophy uplifting moisturizer
i mixed this booster with the philosophy moisturizer
i love that it has sunscreen
this cream is definitely lightweight!
finding a moisturizer for my skin has been a struggle
it's not a final moisturizer for me
i needed a light weight moisturizer for warmer weather
a charcoal mask while using this light moisturizer my skin has improved in a matter of days
it does not produce a "shine" under makeup that some gel-based moisturizers do
i applied the moisturizer right away
the moisturizer has a very clean
i absolutely love this lotion
i highly recommend giving this lotion a try!
i already used a gel moisturizer for daytime use
with any other moisturizer you get around 1.7.
i love this cream
i love this cream
i definitely prefer this product to the azulene gel
i kept using this cream
i am always on the hunt for a new moisturizer
this is a great winter moisturizer that is both light weight
one of the best cream ever!
even my mascara and liner were gone.
usually removes 99% of eyeliner, mascara, etc.
is ready to receive the nighttime skincare
(even stubborn waterproof mascara!)
mascara like no ones business
took my waterproof mascara off in seconds
the oil is also useful for breaking up waterproof mascara
even with liquid eyeliner
i don't even need to apply a moisturizer
this certainly is a great moisturizer.
the lancôme also desolves my mascara
i think that comes with my serum and moisturizer.
don't really need to moisturizer during the day too much
i loved the consistency of this moisturizer cream
it was thicker than most moisturizers i've tried
it's like getting botox plumping
i usually use the ole henriksen moisturizer
i typically pick up whatever cheap drugstore moisturizer i can find
best moisturizer i've ever used.
i love this moisturizer
i love the texture of this moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer.
i look forward to trying out lancome's other age creams
i love this moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer by lancome.
i like this moisturizer.
next time i'm going to try the liquid lotion essence in this line
i am a lifetime lover of this moisturizer!
then dab a little bit of a more moisturizing cream on my chin
i really love how great this moisturizer makes my skin look
if you plan to use a foundation in addition to this as your morning moisturizer
lancome had a green oil free gel moisturizer
paper no amount of moisturizer would absorb
definitely not a heavy moisturizer
it acts like a lightweight moisturizer
i like this moisturizer a lot.
i would never spend this kind of money on a light-duty moisturizer
most people are probably thinking this is just a moisturizer when i actually think it's more of a serum/moisturizer hybrid
this moisturizer is almost like water!
i love this moisturizer a number of reasons.
2 it's great to use under heavier sunscreen lotions
this is good as serum or if your oily a moisturizer
pearly lotion as your moisturizer
use advanced génefique as your serum before moisturizing -intended for daily use
definitely a must for anyone wanting a refreshing moisturizer that leaves you with a youthful glow
this is my go to moisturizer for the summer.
i like to rotate my skincare depending on the season
i find this to be a nice lightweight moisturizer
think this formula works for me because it isn't a heavy moisturizer
light weight moisturizer is perfect for summer.
what a great summertime moisturizer!
it is an amazing alternative to cream moisturizer
toning in the am then add my moisturizer
the gel-crème moisturizer to go along with it mainly because the girl at sephora recommended it
it's honestly one of the best moisturizers ever!
i still use my regular moisturizer
i follow the serum with a heavier nighttime moisturizer
new favorite moisturizer for my oily skin
i love good moisturizers
s down the best moisturizer i have ever used
i can see the appeal of this lightweight moisturizer
light moisturizer especially for the summer
this is a great moisturizer.
this moisturizer doesn't irritate my skin in combination
it doesn't feel like a greasy or oily moisturizer
if you suffer from dry skin this is the moisturizer for you
it's better then most gel form moisturizers.
some other gel moisturizer
i like that the moisturizer not only mattifies
also had good sunscreen protection
the last think i thought she would recommend was a moisturizer
until trying this moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer with spf20.
the only bad thing is that dosen't leave a high moisturizing sensation
so this moisturizer does work till it over powered
it's a great moisturizer love it
dry spots need extra lotion
by "mattifying" it means it's just not one of those oily sunscreens that look greasy
this moisturizer is awesome for my face i have super super oily face
i love the moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer/sunscreen i have ever used
i love this moisturizer!
15 minutes for moisturizer to set into my skin which all my past moisturizers would do
this mattifying moisturizer is great for my shiny t-zone
i need a moisturizer to prevent me being oily
i don't have to worry about applying sunscreen because it has spf
this moisturizer has become one of my holy grails
this cream on top
i've tried a lot of mattifying moisturizers that don't make me feel greasy
this moisturizer is perfect
but this sunscreen is pretty good.
i've searched for a moisturizer that meets up to actually mattifying my skin
i love how light weight this moisturizer feels while still having an spf component
i love this moisturizer.
you'll want to use something much more moisturizing
this is the only moisturizer i've found that keeps me matte pretty much all day
i love the texture of this moisturizer.
my skin feels less oily than with other moisturizers i have used
this moisturizer doesn't smell like it has spf in it
this is the sunscreen for you
has spf- did i say matte already?
it mattifies shine, has spf and is a moisturizer.
this is a great mattifying moisturizer.
this moisturizer keeps me matte at least 4 hours
it's really hard for me to find a moisturizer with spf i can actually use
have been on the hunt for a good moisturizer
i finally found my moisturizer!
to be honest i never thought that i could find a daily moisturizer that is mattifying
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used in my life
this has everything you could want in a daily moisturizer
with oily skin it's tough to find a moisturizer with an spf that doesn't feel greasy after applying
i keep coming back to this moisturizer after trying other products
nothing has come close to this moisturizer.
i get so many compliments on my skin when i use this moisturizer
i finally found a moisturizer/sunscreen that i love
love that it has sunscreen without the greasiness
loved this moisturizer for everyday sun protection without being oily like so many other spf products
this is the only lotion that works
i paired this moisturizer with a setting spray
i got a sample of this moisturizer at my local sephora after telling informing them of my current moisturizer
thanks to the spf sunscreen
this lotion give us oily girls that matte finish we crave
i loved this moisturizer all summer
my favorite use for this moisturizer is weekends during the day when i want a matte finish
i adore this moisturizer.
i still found that i needed a light moisturizer under this one
as someone with combo skin i've been on the hunt for a mattifing moisturizer
with the mattifying moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
this moisturizer is great for my combination skin
this is great under my foundations that don't have sunscreen
of mattifying moisturizer with sunscreen
the american academy of dermatologists now recommends spf 30 for daily use so
i just feel like it works for my skin best with another daily moisturizer underneath
i truly love this moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is perfect
the best moisturizer ever.
i mix it with my first aid beauty moisturizer.
follow it up with a more moisturizing spf lotion on areas that tend to be more dry
absolutely love this mortifying moisturizer!!
i love this lotion.
its cheaper than the other mattifying moisturizers
i do put another moisturizer or serum under it as i don't think it s moisturizing enough for me
always on the lookout for the holy grail matte sunscreen
perfect 'foundation' for foundation or concealer.
i just started using daily moisturizer
can't use it to replace my daily moisturizer
this is great everyday moisturizer that also protects you from the sun
i always look for a daytime moisturizer with spf
i definitely wanted a moisturizer with spf
this is the only moisturizer with spf that does not cause me break out
this is the best moisturizer for oily skin!
i always get super shiny with foundation so sunscreens are always a challenge for me
i love this moisturizer .
it feels like a moisturizer when you put it on
the daily moisturizer i receive compliments on my skin for the first time ever
of course this amazing daily moisturizer
it is a thicker moisturizer
i used it as a night moisturizer.
absolutely love this moisturizer!
i put it on over my normal lotion.
use it as a highlighter on top of my tinted sunscreen
even though my skin is oily i thought this moisturizer brought a nice balance of dewy
i put it under my cc tinted moisturizer
it almsot is like a lotion highlighter.
i noticed when i use this moisturizer it helps keep my face matte all day
sometimes i just use it alone without moisturizer before bed
it's now also substituted as my daily moisturizer
i've also used this on my bikini line after a wax or shaving
i think the combination of an oil-based moisturizer
this is a skincare priority
i used a moisturizer after suffering my first midwest winter
the moisturizer broke me out so bad
it also won't combine with your moisturizer
then put on your moisturizer
trust me it will change your skincare game
mpressed i even bought the moisturizer they suggested using along with it
then apply my moisturizer
sleeping facial for my night moisturizer
then put my moisturizer on afterwards
like some moisturizers have already become
i usually put a moisturizer on top of this
i don't even need a moisturizer after this stuff
it is probably because i use a moisturizer underneath
my skin wasn't tight or in need of a moisturizer
nothing moisturizer won't fix
it feels like i'm pampering myself
feels like your really pampering yourself
was flaking no matter how much moisturizer
doing this topically 2-3 times a week will change your skin
some lipgloss on a daily basis
i've tried multiple creams that do good for my eyes
this moisturizer does not give me amazing results
great everyday moisturizer for oily/combo skin.
the most perfect moisturizer ever!
i usually like thick moisturizers
this moisturizer definitely holds place amongst the top moisturizers on my list
i did not like this moisturizer when i was using 3 different moisturizers at the time
my younger brother's skin also looked amazing as he started using my moisturizer as well
then i add moisturizer on top
i do use a sunscreen as recommended.
not another cream product"
this is the best day moisturizer i have ever used
i can apply this with some concealer
i tried using it for just a regular moisturizer
use it on top of another moisturizer just for the beautiful natural glow
i mean many illuminating moisturizers
i almost don't need much tinted moisturizer mixed in with it or on my skin
come on, it's just a moisturizer.
although i wear it under my tinted moisturizer
it doesn't last once you put the moisturizer on
it did a nice job of moisturizing without building up on my skin
i am blown away by this moisturizer.
illuminizing moisturizer that is perfect for the summer
when worn under my normal under-eye concealer
we suggest mixing the illuminating eye crème with our restorative eye crème for 360 eye treatment
i paired this with the illuminating moisturizer
this is my favorite eye cream product
i actually enjoy using this eye cream
this eye cream is just perfect!
adding this to my skincare regimen
i put on my ole henriksen moisturizer
i added this eye cream to my daytime routine.
i apply this to my undereye
i love this eye cream.
your skin gets dry after so moisturizer immediately
i will say you need a moisturizer immediately after
except the waterproof liner/mascara
alternating the oil control moisturizer in the day
just like with any new skin regimen
i love this cream.
this bottle comes three times more the amount then all my other moisturizers
i absolutely love this moisturizer because of the light texture it has
it's a great light weight moisturizer that works well for oily
this is a lightweight moisturizer
this moisturizer fits the purpose
my skin looks perfect after i rinse it.
after the mask i use my regular moisturizer then apply my makeup
i can only use this once a day then follow with a heavy moisturizer
from foundation to skin creams
my clinique 2 in 1 exfoliator it's a match made in heaven
this mascara is the perfect fto smooth my skin
it will help moisturizer
this year i've added in eye cream
it thanks to my skin regimen
i do recommend using a good exfoliator once a week
i still like to use a moisturizer after
so make sure you have a really good moisturizer
use a good moisturizer with this
this product is great for dabbing a little as a highlighter
the finish of this moisturizer is absolutely gorgeous
i've also mixed a tiny dab in with my tinted moisturizer if i want to look especially dewy
it's not meant to replace a moisturizer.
is great for using before applying a cream/liquid based or cream stick foundation
i love using this in the morning to freshen up my skin before i continue with my skincare
i love that it feels like a lotion
i follow this with a kate somerville moisturizer
started really investing in skincare
it's definitely my holy grail skincare.
moisturizer just as i normally would
i used it in the morning before my moisturizer.
just moisturizers don't help with my dry patches
skincare dream come true!
then apply my usual moisturizer
i follow this with a ren youth cream moisturizer.
not a lot of moisturizer/facial products wow me
then apply an actual moisturizer over it
this works great if i use it alone as a replacement for my daytime moisturizer
this is here just in time to add to my winter skincare routine
some days i use this as my moisturizer with the flash mist
you can use it as a moisturizer.
feels like a sunscreen when you apply it
i really wanted this to work because of the antiaging claims for elasticity
it took off my mascara
a lotion for moisturizing that will set you back a pretty penny
that you rub in like you would a moisturizer
applied my night moisturizer
probably just like any other moisturizing mask out there
a moisturizer it has been added to my night time routine
it is definitely now a part of my skincare regime
i used this twice a day on top of my acne cream
it has really changed my skincare game
wear that sunscreen though!
this is a must have nightly skincare serum product for me
i take care of my skin with moisturizers
i pair this with a super moisturizer like glamglow thirsty mud
as long as i apply moisturizer afterwards
i follow it with moisturizer to lock in the benefits
i live in the desert so an spf moisturizer follows
followed this up with a light moisturizer.
i also use the youth to the people moisturizer nightly
long wearing eyeshadows etc
moisturizers that did not do what they advertised
i strongly suggest you use this with the yttp moisturizer
have the moisturizer as well
ytp moisturizer doesn't have any dimethicone my skin loves it no breaks outs it's light weight good for oiler skin
one more thing i love about this moisturizer that has antioxidants that prevents future aging of the skin
i also love that this moisturizer is loaded with ha because i've been hitting the glycolics
great face moisturizer for those who have combination
while it says cream
moisturizer because i wanted to try the face wash
has a gel moisturizer effect which is a no no for my skin type
i love this cream!
it goes on like a gel cream
when i started using this moisturizer in the winter i had tightness
i cannot stress how light this moisturizer is
asked an associate for a moisturizer that was lightweight
it's more like a gel than it is a cream
this is the greatest moisturizer i've ever used!
this is a great moisturizer before bed
it's more like a gel cream
this moisturizer was not sticky
this is the perfect moisturizer for oily skin!!!!
it is one of the best lightweight moisturizer i ever tried
i just love everything about this moisturizer!!!!
so a lot of moisturizers make my skin burn
i adore this moisturizer.
i used this as my daytime moisturizer
i love using this as a night moisturizer
when i wasn't using this moisturizer
i apply a bit more cream
this cream is the best!
this is a lovely lotion.
it's great for a morning moisturizer.
i decided to try this moisturizer when my skin got dull
while it could do a bit more in terms of moisturizing
i do use moisturizer in the mornings
this is the first moisturizer (ever!)
i apply it after toner and lotion in the morning.
this is the moisturizer for us !!
this is such an awesome moisturizer!!!
some moisturizers leave my skin feeling nice for a little
most consistent with a lotion.
that is very sensitive to moisturizers of any kind
this moisturizer is light but powerful.
i love the moisturizer!
my all time favorite moisturizer.
i chose this kale moisturizer over fresh any day
i love this moisturizer!!
i usually have issues with product pilling either with my sunscreen or makeup
worked beautifully under my biore perfect milk sunscreen
in the meantime i'm going to find something a little more moisturizing
i would say it's more of a summer moisturizer
it's probably the best moisturizer i have tried
i spent some time trying to find a good moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
hate most moisturizers because they slide off my skin
i am obsessed with this moisturizer!
i'd say this is a good daytime moisturizer.
loved the way this moisturizer made my face feel.
this moisturizer is very light weight
does an amazing job at moisturizing on top of the jojoba oil i regularly apply to my face
i guess most "good" moisturizers are
for me- i have found my hg moisturizer
i do not think this moisturizer is moisturizing enough on its own for the harsh new engl
do apply another moisturizer lightly on top of my dryer areas a few mins after applying this cream
don't be afraid to apply additional moisturizer on top of this if it isn't moisturizing enough
this moisturizer has saved my skin
i actually love this moisturizer.
one of my favorite moisturizers.
besides the roebucks face anti-aging moisturizer i also use at night
moisturizer from this br
the moisturizer is light
this is definitely the best moisturizing product i've bought so far
this is the cream!
i really like this moisturizer!
instead of my belif solutions moisturizer that i normally put on for daytime
did not break me out like the glow moisturizer
i am very happy with this moisturizer!
best moisturizer i've ever used.
i love the cleanser and this moisturizer.
i don't even have to use foundation or concealer anymore
reviewing skin care isn't like reviewing an eyeshadow
this concealer has saved my life.
no more mass amounts of concealer and foundation.
it was a bit cakey for me when i used it as a concealer
this is a miracle total coverage concealer.
i just touch a little powder concealer
it is definitely more like a mattefying foundation than a skin care "cream"
note: i do use a heavy moisturizer- makeup really shouldn't dry me out
normal concealer doesn't even cover as good as this cream
it's incredibly difficult to cover without packing on the concealer
adding a little moisturizer seems to help
could be warmed up with bronzer
my only complaint is that i have to wear concealer/foundation on top because it's too dark for my skin tone
also use it as a concealer when i want light coverage
it blends super well with my bobbi brown concealer with either a brush or a beauty blender
i wanted to try this because the redness shows though when wearing tinted moisturizer
makes my skin look so even that i don't even need tinted moisturizer
the instructions still say to put tinted moisturizer / foundation on top
put bronzer or blush
this cream is amazing.
i barely need any concealer
while using this under foundation i haven't had to use any concealer except for under the eyes
when my skin is more tan
when my skin starts to lighten up again in the winter i mix this with it's bye bye undereye concealer
/use just bbue as a spot concealer all over my face
this is a great concealer to cover redness on your face everywhere except the under eye area
usually just apply over moisturizer/sunscreen
unless i wanted to cake on concealer- no
yes this is pretty much like a full cover concealer
when i told the sephora girl that i wanted a concealer to cover redness
concealer all in one
this correcting cream works for me
it's sits nicely with moisturizer
s of dollars i have spent on prescription creams
i 'm using it as foundation/concealer
i’ve also been using the superhero mascara
under at least some concealer
then i realized that you are only suppose to use this under concealer
once you layer your concealer over it you can't see how dark this shade is
i'll continue to use ysl's touche eclat concealer/highlighter on the red patches
with my too-faced bronzer all over
this cream is amazing.
have tried just about every green concealer
most concealers just don't cut it
i usually use 2 layers of concealer
lightest color in foundations/concealer
not sure i like that mascara anyway
removing even my stubborn waterproof mascara
my regular moisturizer is perfect after
bronzers not to mention my eye make up which is waterproof
my eyeliner still on
any long lasting lipstick
it takes off even the toughest waterproof mascara
i do feel the need of a moisturizer after
it gets off my waterproof mascara
it works on all waterproof 24hr even my kvd eyeliner
i can't comment on those who use waterproof mascara
will easily remove waterproof mascara
this balm is amazing!!
i need something mattifying
this is like a hybrid of moisturizer
i don't particularly like eye creams.
this eye cream works great!
i got this thinking it would be a good moisturizer for my undereyes
i put on eyeliner every morning
come back to apply makeup/moisturizer
however it still is a very good moisturizer
i just really like this eye cream!
no amount of concealer can cover them
i can follow it with my concealer
my under eye are tends to get a bit dry due to my concealer
this cream works wonders
it wears well under make up i just wish it was a little more moisturizing
i prefer to use this at night with my heavier creams
am only using this eye cream at bedtime
good under-eye concealers
tried using this eye cream
i really like this eye cream!
tarte eye creams for years
the best eye cream i have ever used.
i've probably tried a good 30+ eye creams over the years
eye cream is my favorite part of the day
my eyes love this cream.
i didn't expect this cream to do anything for my undereye puffiness or bags
same as my moisturizer
read all the hype about the "it skincare " line
no problem with concealer over it
my concealer goes on much better
it helps a lot when i apply under eye concealer
so far i am really loving it cosmetics bye bye under eye cream
this moisturizer is amazing!
i recommend this moisturizer for every age group
i wanted to put this moisturizer to the test
i know i have found my winter moisturizer
i will totally 100% love this moisturizer forever
this is my new holy grail moisturizer.
not a con, just general advice for moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer!!!
this moisturizer doesn't make my skin feel thick
this moisturizer is soooo good!!
i highly recommend this moisturizer to everyone it's the best
the only problem is that since i use this moisturizer morning
this moisturizer is amazing!
which i prefer in a moisturizer
this is my new holy grail daily moisturizer!
the minute i put on this moisturizer my face became so radiant
it's the best moisturizer ever which makes my skin so soft
i first received a sample of this moisturizer not thinking much of it
this cream is amazing.
as this is a true cream
i also started using the kate somerville eradikate acne treatment cleanser the same night i tried this moisturizer
this moisturizer does not irritate my skin
i should have known i would love this moisturizer from it as i've been loyal to their cc cream for the last 6 tubes
use two different types of moisturizer
upon opening this moisturizer
this lotion could replace all of my thick creams
this cream was my first real "high end" moisturizer
this moisturizer has become a holy grail for me
i love this moisturizer!!
needed a heavier moisturizer for winter.
was in need of a good winter moisturizer
fell in love with this moisturizer
this spring/summer i will go back to my light weight moisturizer
i love this cream.
this cream is amazing.
this is an amazing moisturizer.
i am a huge believer in moisturizing your skin especially your face
i am a huge addicted to hydrate creams i been try probably 22 different this cream
this moisturizer has a thick cream
i can use this moisturizer during the day without it being greasy
love this moisturizer so much, use day and night.
so my winter moisturizer
this moisturizer is smooth
this moisturizer has been just perfect
i love this cream!!!
i decided to give the moisturizer a try
this is one of the best moisturizers i've used in a while
this is the perfect moisturizer before makeup
my go-to multi-tasking moisturizer.
my favorite heavy face moisturizer so far!
my favorite thing about this moisturizer is how quickly it absorbs
i am in love with this moisturizer!
this is the best moisturizing cream i have ever used
i can put on a daily moisturizer under my makeup
wouldn't recommend for a daily moisturizer under makeup
i love this moisturizer.
i even use as a light-weight day moisturizer- great under makeup
this is a great day cream.
this was recommended as a heavy duty moisturizer that wouldn't break out my sensitive skin
i feel good about this lotion
this cream is no joke: it is thick like an ointment
i used this cream twice
and it doesn't sting like so many moisturizers.
so every time i've tried a thicker moisturizer
this moisturizer is well worth the price!
the moisturizer contains spf
it does make my it cosmetics cc cream go on smoothly
this moisturizer completely softened my skin!
you still might need another moisturizer
this moisturizer has been fantastic for my skin
suggest using it as a night time moisturizer
i love it as a spot moisturizer for red areas
these creams used together are a dream.
it moisturizer my skin
i really like this cream
this cream saved my skin.
it is a perfect moisturizer
i hardly even touch powder or concealer.
also found that it's a great moisturizer
red skin give this cream a try
great moisturizer for dry skin
the green cream sunscreen too
for moisturizer i like ceramidin better
now this cream is definitely not the most moisturizing product i have used
than you might want something a little more moisturizing
it's definitely thicker than most moisturizers
this cream is a little thicker than the ceramidin cream
this gives me a chance to add another thinner face lotion into my skin care routine
it also works great as a lip balm or a night cream
when i am using long-wear lipsticks
i love this cream!
the only criticism i would have to say is that this creams dry very matte
this moisturizer is amazing!
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used!
so finding a good moisturizer that meets my skin
i read about this cream
all-in-all, one of my favorite moisturizers.
i love this cream!
moisturizer for my skin
i applied this cream
1000/10, this is a miracle cream.
although this does not provide the red coverage a true color correcting green concealer would
do wear this product over my daily moisturizer
different moisturizers-- you name it i tried it
i try that cream
it evens my skin tone enough that i only need some concealer
this is the best at removing waterproof mascara.
i used this moisturizer/spf
i just wear it by itself with a little concealer
with concealer it's perfect for everyday
bye bye redness from it cosmetics was too thick
i put on a light moisturizer
with my redness it's really hard to resist using foundation or concealer
this lotion is great for color correction.
also under bb cream or tinted moisturizer
i feel like this will be a staple in my skincare
this product really is more like a bb cream than a moisturizer which i suppose is because of the color correction
follow with a really good moisturizer
a little of this applied with my fingers over my moisturizer
after a few sweeps of bronzer
some lipstick or gloss
i only use a little concealer on any pimples
i apply a little bit of highlighter
it also works great as a tinted moisturizer base.
use this with moisturizer since it can be drying on a daily basis
t’s best to prep the skin with moisturizer for smoother application
i don’t like the feeling of foundation or sunscreen
for that you need color correcting concealer.
i moisturize, then slather this stuff on.
i needed a daily sunscreen.
and it didn't have that typical sunscreen smell.
as a moisturizer, this fails short.
i add my regular moisturizer to it.
have to use more moisturizer underneath
this is magic cream!
i still put a bit of concealer on my dark circles
i usually wear sunscreen
one thing i realized about this product is that it's very moisturizing so you don't need to put moisturizer before
i am super excited about this lotion.
i love this cream.
that could be cause i used another moisturizer under it
i don't use foundation only a concealer for all these problem spots
i recommend using a matte foundation or mattifying powder over top to combat
for mascara i use the sephora waterproof eye makeup remover
however it didn't dissolve my waterproof mascara
i don't wear waterproof mascara
it takes off waterproof mascara
it took off every bit of my waterproof mascara
took off all my make up including my waterproof mascara
occasionally i have some mascara left in my lashes
it removed my mascara
green eyeshadow with a heavy eyeliner
pencil + liquid liner+ mascara
especially when it came to mascara
doesn't leave steaks of mascara all over my face
takes off the mascara
i do recommend a heavy moisturizer after this melt away as it is
i regularly wear waterproof gel eyeliner that i apply with a brush
i don't use waterproof mascara
this gets all of my mascara off once i massage my eyes for about 15-20 seconds
which was uncomfortable when it got on my eyes taking off waterproof mascara
it really does remove even waterproof eyeliner or mascara
it removes all of my make up from liquid lips to waterproof mascara to heavy duty concealers
waterproof mascara more effectively
this took off my colour pop matte lipstick like it was nothing
didn't need any moisturizer
it is basically oil, so i mix it with lotion.
cream is very light
ingredients of this cream are really great
will buy again for my go-to daily moisturizer
i generally don't wear moisturizers during the day because my skin can get oily
its not an eye cream
this face cream, one of their cru eye cream.
this is the absolute best daytime moisturizer i have every used
it will quickly become your favorite daytime moisturizer
this cream is it
i really like this cream.
a daily moisturizer that goes on beautifully
this cream is amazing
i love this moisturizer.
my favorite cream ever!
this moisturizer made my skin so soft
this is by far my favorite moisturizer yet.
i've used every moisturizer you can think of
i recommend this for either a day or night moisturizer
i can be used as a deep moisturizer as part of your bedtime routine or it can be used as a light moisturizer before applying cosmetics
this creme is truly for all skin types.
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used!
it is a thicker moisturizer that feels great at night
always added jojoba to my paula's choice moisturizer for the last 7 years or so
the cream is heavier
i can see this working as a moisturizer/primer if your skin is not too dry
i got a sample of this moisturizer
waiting is best with any moisturizer
i am a fan of this moisturizer
this is a solid moisturizer.
the cream was nice
i love this cream.
this creme is one of the best moisturizer ever
my face feels refreshed when applying the creme
i love this moisturizer.
a good moisturizer is probably one of the hardest thing to find
a nice change from heavy, greasy night creams.
this moisturizer literally changed my skin
i've never had a moisturizer feel like this.
non greasy moisturizer that would help even out my skin's texture
i am loving this moisturizer!
farmacy beauty sleep tight balm
i've tried many moisturizers from premium
i highly recommend it for those who have little time some nights to layer skincare
if i need some pampering
so this is a perfect combo of a super heavy cream to oil moisturizer
pure nilotica melt nourishing balm-to-oil: it is an excellent natural skincare product that gave me a fantastic touch every night giving me a new magic sensation every morning with organic ingredients that heal my skin during my sweet sleep
mixed it with a little of the lancer moisturizer i had left
this product is perfect for anyone with dry spots or anyone seeking a moisturizing night treatment
my skin feels moisturizer
cream that lasts forever
this balm is amazing!
i apply this after my usual cream
i normally burn even with sunscreen on
i slather it on when i board
applying moisturizer on after it's absorbed helps a lot
i do add a moisturizer since this is a retinoid
it is amazing eye cream.
so much so that i have put off my search for under eye concealer
this is a pricey eye cream
this moisturizer isn't super heavy
please note the retinol might burn a smidge
my concealer goes on smoothly with no creasing
i think the moisturizer works really well
it is a terrific moisturizer for my mature
i think this will likely become my go to winter moisturizer
i used one of the sample sunscreens without checking if it was ok for sensitive skin
it really is a beauty sleep cream.
use this moisturizer day
though the initial scent of this moisturizer is heavy
definitely recommend this moisturizer.
i can't spend this much on moisturizer
i tried so many different moisturizers
i've really been enjoying this moisturizer
need to add a heavier moisturizer on top
this moisturizer has cleared up my adult acne
i love this moisturizer so much
this moisturizer has made a huge improvement!
i love this lotion!
i love this moisturizer
this moisturizer has not made be break out at all
with this product i actually use less of my moisturizer
from my eyebrows to my waterproof mascara that normally i have to scrub twice for
daytime i am using the belif cream moisturizer
this moisturizer is so underrated.
i finally found a moisturizer that i love!
i've used up a whole bottle of the true cream moisturizing bomb
their moisturizing bomb cream that i had come to love wasn't quite heavy enough for me
and this was used as the moisturizer base.
i've struggled with finding a moisturizer that is oil free
worth a try if anyone is struggling with trying to find an oil free hydrating moisturizer
follow with the moisturizer
i think i might try another one of their moisturizers
i already had my eye on tatcha skincare
overall this skincare set it definitely worth your money
concealer if it gets cakey
i will usually mix a drop in with my daytime moisturizer as well
before buying this i would moisturizer religiously
i absolutely love this moisturizer
it works perfect as a night cream
it is the best moisturizer i have ever owned.
not easy for me to find a moisturizer that i love
skincare can get pricey
i hated this moisturizer at first.
the moisturizer goes on so much smoother now.
this is a moisturizer for those with very dry skin
i never thought i'd find a moisturizer that would hydrate my skin without breaking it out
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
the moisturizer is very thick
but this moisturizer feels absolutely amazing!
then feels like a light moisturizer
great for an everyday moisturizer.
this should be used as a night time moisturizer
i love this as a moisturizing leave-on night mask
like a nice rich moisturizer to follow
moisturizer, definitely a must try.
this moisturizer was perfect for my skin this winter
i especially love that the cream is unscented
i've tried to find a moisturizer heavy enough that works for broken down skin
i am beyond impressed by this "simple" moisturizer
this cream is the best
pure is my holy grail moisturizer!
it is perfect to use at night overtop of my serums
this moisturizer is fantastic!
this moisturizer feels a bit heavy for the summer right now
i am the pickiest person when it comes to moisturizers
i finally found my best moisturizer cream
this is one of the best creams i've ever tried!
i'll definitely be keeping this as part of skincare regimen
i love this moisturizer.
want to tame your wrinkles, try this cream asap!
i love this face lotion!
this is my new favorite moisturizer!
i love this face cream.
this moisturizer is amazing to put on at night
i found this to be a very effective skin cream
tried every moisturizer in sephora
this moisturizer is amazing.
please carry the eye cream and serums, sephora!
this cream is everything!
this is such a miracle cream.
best cream ever used to soften my skin.
chin that i have always had to exfoliate like crazy
definitely a great skincare company.
i needed to use a lot of lotion.
however it doesn't completely take off waterproof mascara
the bar took off my waterproof mascara with ease.
definitely apply lotion though
s are a little dry without moisturizer
like i can't put moisturizer on fast enough.
it's the perfect start to my skincare routine.
you'll be fine if a bit of moisturizer
takes off a normal amount of mascara
if you use heavy mascara
i still would use my regular moisturizer afterwards
i need to put lotion on
i still had to use a daily face lotion though.
it easily takes all my mascara
i did use some makeup remover to melt down my waterproof mascara
with a good moisturizer to follow after it- it would be perfect
moisturizers i was using before
i only need a moisturizer for small problem spots
i didn't even use a moisturizer
i almost felt like moisturizer wasn't needed after using this wash
i also use waterproof mascara
i followed with my usual moisturizer
i like to load up on moisturizer after
let it be moisturizer or make up
that is easily fixed with a serum or lotion
i follow up with a good moisturizer with spf in the morning
i do follow with serums/moisturizers
since using this in conjunction with my moisturizer
love this eye cream!
love this eye cream!
this is one of the best eye creams i have ever used
it's not heavy like most eye creams are!
this eye cream is amazing
causes concealer to crease like whoa
i often feel creams don't really go deep to truly moisturize
i love this moisturizer
this eye cream is amazing.
it's the perfect eye cream for morning
this is the best under eye moisturizer i have ever tried
my concealer has never looked better
when i started incorporating this face wash the moisturizer it comes with
ingredients that are fun to have in a face cream
happy yet matte finish that easily takes in the next moisturizer i slap on after it
my must for skin care is eye cream,
maybe messing with my concealer
an unusual type of moisturizer that is for dry spots
i will never go back to the drugstore moisturizers
i couldn't use moisturizer at all.
i mostly use it as a mask or a night moisturizer.
i really love to use this on my cuticles
i recently used an eyeshadow that must of had some sort of latex that im allergic to
i buy crazy expensive moisturizers
this "lotion" is a god send!
i feel luxurious applying this.
i sometimes mix my lotion
i mix it with my moisturizer at night
can only see myself using this at night time as a moisturizer
you should stick to creams
use regular moisturizer for the other places
this stuff is perfect for a nighttime winter moisturizer
i slather this on my face
i usually layer on moisturizer
i would never use it as a true moisturizer
at least as an all-over moisturizer
love this highlighting moisturizer makes my skin look dewy
end up having to put regular moisturizer or serum on the more dry patches
moisturizer that works for me already
i would not use this as an all-over-face moisturizer
this is a great brightening moisturizer
after applying my usual moisturizer to my face
as a moisturizer it's not bad
i wouldn't use this product as a moisturizer all over the face
do not buy this as a moisturizer
not my favorite moisturizer
i really like it as a strategically placed highlighter-moisturizer combo
some moisturizers make me crazy oily
i mix this with my nars tinted moisturizer
definitely a good daily moisturizer
i also used just the moisturizer then applied just some powder over it
this moisturizer is different.
the glittery component of this moisturizer is so small that it doesn't look like glitter
i used this alone as a moisturizer
used as a moisturizer/ primer
flakey skin i applied it on top of my daily cetaphil moisturizer
i applied concealer on top of this
is it a highlighter... a moisturizer... a primer?
if you don't want any hydration at all use it as a moisturizer
if you use it as a liquid highlighter
since stila discontinued their illuminating tinted moisturizer
shimmer then this is your lotion
this moisturizer did not make me glittery at all- it left a bit of a luminescence
i add this to my daily moisturizer
this moisturizer is one of the best i've ever tried
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is very light weight
i love this moisturizer
like most moisturizers do
this highlighter moisturizer isn't great by itself
definitely not to be used all over like a lotion
it's a nice moisturizer with a little sheen.
anyway, it's not a heavy moisturizer at all.
i usually wear a full coverage matte foundation
lightweight moisturizer that makes you look like a vampire from twilight if you step into the sun
so you could add another moisturizer or sunscreen underneath or on top
if you are at all interested in a moisturizing primer that will improve your skin tone
and then some of the new mascara and that's it.
i love to use it as an everyday moisturizer under a bb cream
i really like this moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
makes your concealer go on way smoother
creating a primed surface for my concealer
literally the only one that works for me is the tart shapetape concealer
i stopped wearing concealer
for someone who wears concealer everyday
i love this cream.
stopped any smearing of my eyeliner
when i apply before makeup it makes my concealer go on flawless if i use it just for my skincare routine my eye area just looks great after
i love eye creams
also allowing for my concealer to wear all day long
made a very nice canvas for concealer
i definitely recommend this eye cream!!
i don't really use eye creams.
i usually go straight for concealer or eye base.
i loveee this eye cream so much!
it makes my under eyes moisturized for concealer
the eye balm is a combo eye cream/1 minute blur so you apply it
overall, i like this cream.
with or without under eye concealer
is the perfect primer for any concealer
put a small amount on before applying any concealer or foundation
i would definitely recommend this product to anyone in need of a great eye cream that moisturizes without a greasy look
it also works great as a primer before putting on under eye concealer or eyeshadow
i can't get enough of how quickly this eye cream moisturizes
honestly one of the better eye creams i've ever used
i am fairly new to eye creams
my concealer sits amazingly well on top of it
i don't normally wear eye balm
i also liked how it stayed put under concealer.
didn't make my concealer glide off during the day
my concealer stayed in place all day
i like this eye cream!
helps prevent my eye concealer from becoming cakey
even when i use a brightening concealer
i notice it helps my concealer look better
concealer went on beautifully for a perfect application
i love this eye cream
there were small shimmer specs in the formula which didn't bother me since i applied concealer
i liked the eye cream
i used it as a primer under additional concealer
i did enjoy the lightweight cream
i put it over the moisturizer
i love this moisturizer so much i'll be sticking with it for a while
my new all time favorite night time moisturizer.
i found this moisturizer to work well with my skin type
it's still a good moisturizer no doubt
the stress of finding my go to moisturizer is gone
or even as a moisturizer in the morning
this lotion truly does firm up the lines
this is an amazing moisturizer!
s down the best moisturizer i've ever used
think i will alternate this with a heavier moisturizing cream for winter since my skin is dry
it's not really moisturizer
it claims it is a moisturizer
needs a moisturizer on top of this
if you want a great moisturizer
so when i tried this lightweight moisturizer
for my normal skin i wouldn't need an additional moisturizer
t's a great base before moisturizer
doing the kate somerville age delay over as my moisturizer
after i always apply a moisturizer
eye cream on top of that then bb cream then makeup
is invisible under moisturizer
for the morning before your moisturizer
i love this as a moisturizer for no makeup days because it makes your skin look radiant
a typical high end moisturizer has 2
i enjoy this product as it has a moisturizer included
so this being a plus that i don't need to apply moisturizer before my primer
i only use concealer to spot conceal
the priming moisturizer is the best
wouldn't recommend it as a daily moisturizer of you're not going to cover it with foundation
concealer goes on nicely after applying this
i often only apply concealer
only sometimes wear concealer
this is my morning moisturizer.
i absolutely love how this lotion leaves a glowy appearance
it's perfect for the summer because i can skip my regular moisturizer
wish it had spf for the sun
i actually use this as a moisturizer after my toner
not as strong as a suntan oil
great moisturizer/ primer for the summer.
not too strong like some moisturizers that can give u a headache
it's a great step before applying my daily sunscreen
because this one is a moisturizer/primer for whatever reason
what this primer does is smooth out your skin to create a base for products while acting as a moisturizer
i wear this primer/moisturizer combo under a bb cream every single day
regular moisturizer dont help through out the day
this isn't a pore-filling primer nor is it a super rich moisturizer
also as a cream highlighter on my cheeks over my foundation
this is great as a moisturizer
this is nice moisturizer for the morning routine
i love this moisturizer.
this is definitely much better than both in terms of a moisturizer/primer combo
this is the best moisturizing primer i've found that best suits my skin
it definitely does feel like more of a moisturizer
this is an awesome moisturizer--it's very light
this is great as a moisturizer/primer for dry skin
i love this primer.moisturizer.
this works wonderful as a moisturizer
f you like that type of primer/moisturizer stay away
just this with first aid moisturizer
as a bonus i can moisturize with the rose
i don't like to wear waterproof mascara because of the difficulty
this takes off my liquid lipsticks
i do find with mascara i have to hold
struggles a bit with mascara
i don't even *have* to use moisturizer afterwards
it took off all my mascara
i like to just pamper my skin
originally thought it was a facial moisturizer
this stuff worked as a moisturizer
now that i know it's not a moisturizer
the rose is the consistency of lotion
i applied it as moisturizer
this product goes beautifully under foundation or just as a moisturizer for oily skin
i think this can be used as both an everyday moisturizer
i've never had a moisturizer do such an amazing job
i can use it with or without moisturizer
the bright side is this is moisturizing at some level
it goes on like a transparent white paste/moisturizer
it's the consistency of a lotion
really helps with people like my skin who tend to over exfoliate
applying moisturizer three times a day trying to help combat it
i don't know how to use concealers or or foundations
moisturizer it well before going to bed
i actually have to use less concealer
this moisturizer smells soo good.
this moisturizer is my absolute favorite
it's one of the few moisturizers where i actually feel a difference immediately
this is a great new moisturizer that truly does quench dry skin
this moisturizer is lightweight
balanced after using any clarins moisturizer
peels if i go even one day without a really good moisturizer
i prefer to use this as just a day moisturizer because it is more of a lightweight moisturizer
this moisturizer works great
i love this moisturizer.
i always have a hard time finding a moisturizer
i will partner this with the daytime clarins cream-gel from the same hydration line as serum moisturizers below the skin whereas a moisturizer will get the top layers
the cream moisturizer that goes with it
i love that this serves the purpose of a moisturizer as well as a primer
in the winter i layered this on top of my moisturizer
i add a little sunscreen to this in the morning
make my own tinted moisturizer
it is an amazing moisturizer
i don't actually use this moisturizer to prime my skin
rather i use this as my daily moisturizer
first i'll say i would never recommend using this as your moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer and primer in one!
this is a wonderful daytime moisturizer.
this stuff is the perfect daytime moisturizer
my foundation glides over this primer/ moisturizer hybrid
this is an awesome moisturizer for my super oily skin
a moisturizer and primer in one!
this moisturizer gets a st
tends to drink up my moisturizer leaving my skin dying for me
this moisturizer is absolutely amazing.
i finally had enough of exfoliating my face on a regular basis
i absolutely adore this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is great!
when a moisturizer is so light
i love the entire kit, especially this cream.
this is a great all-day moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer that i have owned so far in my life
i actually love that in a moisturizer
the texture of this moisturizer is great
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used!
i gave it four stars instead of 5 because i prefer a bit less of a glow from my moisturizer
so moisturizers are not a daily part of my routine
it's a good moisturizer too.
does work much longer than most moisturizers
i like this much better than the drunk elephant moisturizer
this moisturizer is so light.
it doesn't have that typical sticky moisturizer feel
probably the best moisturizer i've used!
if you're considering a gel like moisturizer
because i was switching skincare products i then bought this moisturizer
i find that if i use this moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer i've tried that doesn't really increase oil
i actually really enjoy this moisturizer
i can buy a tub of cerave hyluronic acid moisturizer three times the product
ill still finish this moisturizer
this was the best moisturizer !
s down the nicest moisturizer i've ever put on my face
i've had a really hard time finding a moisturizer that actually works to keep my dry spots moisturized
i really haven't found a moisturizer that i loved
the last few moisturizers i've tried have not worked well
this is by far the best moisturizer ive ever used
this is a really good moisturizer
i did apply my night cream/day uv lotion over it.
feels like a cloud on your face best moisturizer ever
then apply moisturizer on dry areas of my skin
this moisturizer is the truth.
i fell in love with this moisturizer immediately.
which is one of my favorite moisturizers
is the greatest moisturizer ever!
struggle finding a moisturizer that doesn't irritate my skin
great moisturizer to use in the morning.
i began my search for a good moisturizer.
i keep trying out different gel moisturizers that get sent to me in my two beauty subscription boxes
this cream made my skin look
i've never used a moisturizer like this.
it's the perfect summer moisturizer.
gel moisturizers are kind of a thing now
i love this moisturizer!
this is a great light-weight moisturizer for my to apply in the mornings before my make up
find some moisturizers can make my skin look really shiny/greasy when applied under makeup
this lotion totally made them disappear
this lotion is so good.
i am always leery of moisturizers because i don't want acne
i just used about the size of a dime to moisturize my entire face
it's a very light weight moisturizer that is perfect for before makeup
i hate moisturizers that leave an oily film or stickiness on my skin
moisturizers it instead of sitting on top of my skin
this moisturizer is amazing.
this feels more like a moisturizer
i slather it on every night
this is one of the best moisturizers i've tried.
i don't think i'll be changing from this moisturizer for a while
i can't say that my face stayed moisturizer for 12 hours
i love philosophy's hope moisturizer
i'd actually compare this to a tinted moisturizer or bb cream with something extra
i don't generally wear foundation or tinted moisturizers
don't have to use bronzer
have always worn sunscreen religiously
've been putting a moisturizer
most sunscreens do not have a 45 spf
normally i avoid products with sunscreen as it makes my skin burn
$70 is high for a moisturizer
beside the price being high this is a really great detox overnight moisturizer
this overnight moisturizer is legit amazing.
it would make an excellent moisturizer for day when paired with vitamin e serum as both complement one another
can be a good night cream
other night time moisturizers
if you aren't a fan of the extra steps: skin care regimen
have tried just about every mattifying moisturizer
my favorite combination lately has been murad's oil control moisturizer
i used this today as a primer under my moisturizer which had light hydration
i will say it makes you very matte so maybe using a moisturizer that is light
i feel like if you use a mattifying moisturizer
i tried their concealer years ago
i stay matte all day long
when you apply the matte
anywhere you need a moisturizing boost
before applying a tinted lotion for my daily make up
since it's very annoying to travel with both a moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer!
i've tried multiple over this moisturizer
clinique’s moisturizer makes a great primer under makeup
the product was a great day moisturizer that even had spf
i wanted a moisturizer with spf
it does have a strong sunscreen smell
i love this moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer helps to keep my face looking smooth with no dry flaking patches also love that there is spf
this moisturizer completely nails it
my new everyday moisturizer!
the sunscreen is nice due to my sun allergy
not smear my color or mascara
i do not think this is an exfoliator
later at night i felt dry so did add my moisturizer
it also looks so good that i am now hyper vigilant about sunscreen
i follow up with moisturizer after i rise the mask off
definitely adding this to my skincare list.
because you can't put a price tag on skincare
retinol was working ok for me
this moisturizer leaves a dewy glow on my face
i put on moisturizer
i didn't use any serums or moisturizers after the mask because i wanted to see the product work alone
i love this moisturizer.
you still feel the moisturizer on the face
this is the first moisturizer that has given me the occasional breakouts
this moisturizer wears well under my makeup
i would prefer more cream/less gel
i hate moisturizer because it makes my face feel sticky
cream in one use
i like this cream a lot
it is safe to use on your eyes which is nice because it can double as a facial moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
i got a sample of this moisturizer from sephora
a cream moisturizer all nicely packed into one jar
this moisturizer does amazing under makeup
i love this cream gel!!
i love this moisturizer.
this is my favorite moisturizer!
that i got from a stint with a lush moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
applied a little bit more of this moisturizer
this moisturizers amazing not oily at all your face feels fresh
i love this moisturizer!
in my opinion it's a fantastic moisturizer
so happy to finally have found a moisturizer that works for my combination skin
have used shiseido ibuki moisturizer for years
it's like no other moisturizer i've used
finally found a daily moisturizer that's not too thick
this moisturizer is so good!
i've also been using the un-concealer/foundation by rms beauty which really helps when applying together
this is the best moisturizer my search is over!
i've had a hard time finding a nighttime moisturizer that was light enough
this is by far the best moisturizer i have used
i can honestly say it's the best moisturizer i've ever used
this moisturizer makes my skin so soft!!
took a chance on this moisturizer
i'll never switch to any other moisturizer again
this is an amazing skincare product that changed my life
i find i don't need a moisturizer to finish it off
if you are going to splurge: splurge on skincare
i can use this in the winter without a moisturizer
smooth using this moisturizer without getting oily
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
s that many other moisturizers do
i rarely repurchase moisturizer
finally a daily am moisturizer that is not at all greasy
this moisturizer literally has worked wonders for my skin
i really have to say i've found the perfect moisturizer for me
it is my absolute favorite face cream
i prefer to use it as a night cream
that's what i like in a moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer!!
super hydrating moisturizer that i prefer to use at night or when i am not out
i usually have success with ptr's glycolic acid moisturizer
so far, the this moisturizer is heaven in a jar.
this is by far the best moisturizer i have ever used
this moisturizer is awesome both am and pm.
i've tried several other moisturizers that i really liked
really enjoy using this moisturizer at night
sometimes i just use it as an undereye cream
these lotions are my absolute favorite
i normally use a heavy mask type moisturizer in the evening
i still need to find a good day cream with spf
still had to buy a day cream with spf
i think i just found my favorite moisturizer
it is a heavy moisturizer
heavy cream moisturizer that means business
i would say this is a medium weight moisturizer.
this moisturizer is amazing!
i found this to be more moisturizing than any night creams i've used yet it's definitely light enough to use during the day
i tend to moisturizer morning
only use a tinted moisturizer
just the occasional period pimple so this moisturizer works well for me
i applied the moisturizer as a night time cream
searched in my goody box for a heavier moisturizer than i typically use
i'd been using a drugstore moisturizer with spf for years
i love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is great for me.
i've used several moisturizers that certainly helped
this moisturizer applies easily
it doesnt feel very greasy like alot of other moisturizers
i will probably skip a treatment every once in a while to add in a night application of the moisturizer since my acne is calming down
this is a thick moisturizer that i tried since i work outside
the moisturizer does rub in easily.
i then layer another moisturizer over it
this has been a lovely addition to my winter skincare routine
this moisturizer is my new favorite.
i needed a new moisturizer
while using this cream
this cream left it nice
i love this moisturizer
just added this moisturizer to my nighttime routine
s down my new favorite moisturizer day
this moisturizer is very thick
i love this cream.
use it as a night time moisturizer over luna.
is the best facial cream i have used
this will be my go to moisturizer now
i'd recently been searching for a moisturizer that would help calm
will be adding this to my permanent fall/winter skincare regimen
at night i love a rich moisturizer
i love this cream.
i usually purchase more lightweight moisturizers -- they soak in quickly
this moisturizer solves my problem.
this moisturizer is one of the best i have ever tried
i only need to use a small amount to moisturize my face
obsessed with this moisturizer!
i follow up with the face lotion.
making it harder for my moisturizer to work
it locks in the moisturizer to my skin overnight.
i always follow with a moisturizers anyway
i love this moisturizer during winter
redhead skincare is something i take very seriously
i've spent quite a bit on serums
creams this stuff is divine
i apply it after the treatment lotion
this moisturizer is worth every dollar.
trick to applying this creme
don't apply like you do with a regular moisturizer
i find that it layers well under other moisturizers or sunscreens or on top of treatments
you can't spread it on like regular moisturizer
i try to use it in the evenings every other night with additional argan oil to moisturise
i wouldn't bother with the gel cream.
this cream works like magic!
the creme is a bit heavy
i usually just rub my moisturizer on all over my skin
i applied the cream
s of dollars on moisturizers
creams trying to best match my skin as it changed over my 20's
no regular creams would help.
i've never found a moisturizer that i loved.
you'll be spending $50 a month or so on a moisturizer
the best face cream i've ever used
i've tried the spectrum of moisturizers
this cream is life
my skin is moisturizer
will probably switch to it when my moisturizing cream is gone
this moisturizer calms my skin
it might have been the best moisturizer i've ever used
i must say this is one of the best moisturizers for dry aging skin
this cream is amazing.
this cream is perfect.
for now i will stick with my tatcha indigo cream for night use
i've spent so much trying other moisturizers
gel cream in the summer
i love this cream
although i can't make it a staple moisturizer
especially in the soft cream formula
i can't get enough of this amazing moisturizer.
my makeup concealer looks so much better when i use this first
its just a true miracle cream
will never cheat on this eye creme again
this eye cream is my all time favorite.
i go in with this lotion to replenish the moisture to my skin
the treatment lotion lasts so long time.
this is a lovely, light lotion.
in combination with bareminerals skinlongevity eye gel cream
i quite like using this cream.
overall i'd say this is a good moisturizer
this is the perfect light summer moisturizer for my oily/combination skin
an amazing sealant at night or under makeup/sunscreen
not an eye cream
just the same as you would wear a facial serum underneath your moisturizer
will be my go to for skincare
wrinkles to lessen- this is the one beauty product you need to splurge on
my skin was taking a beating despite my constant application of moisturizer
sometimes i put on moisturizer first
this is by far the best concealer
this concealer is by far the best concealer in terms of coverage
i got a lot of acnes with other concealers
started using it as a concealer
it says sunscreen on the bottle.
concealer application went on smoother
it still works nicely over moisturizer
it just feels like a very light moisturizer.
you put this on over your moisturizer
used this on my bare skin and over my concealer.
i applied it after my face moisturizer
4/5 stars because it made my concealer apply unevenly after using the product
it took me a few tries to get the right skincare combo to keep me matte
i normally just dab some concealer
my current tinted moisturizer is a bit too dewy
i tried this velvety serum before applying my makeup
it feels more like a moisturizer.
i follow up with the power moisturizer
all i need is a light tinted moisturizer
this is like no other serum or moisturizer that i have ever used
i actually went a few days without exfoliating my face
serums tend to make me break out
when i put algenist's power wrinkle fighter moisturizer on
i may have put on too much moisturizer.
i love this product i used it at night with a moisturizer
this is by far the best moisturizer i have ever tried
i hope the add an exfoliate to their line!!
most lotion or moisturizer would end up feeling greasy or drying with itchy feeling
my skin does not like thick moisturizer laying on my skin
my skin just drink up this kind of gel moisturizer
this moisturizer is perfect for all seasons
i've always had a hard time finding a gel moisturizer suitable for my skin type at a reasonable price
$52 isn't so bad compared to other $100 gel moisturizers
after using this moisturizer my redness
love this moisturizer so much!
i find most moisturizers leave my skin oily
okay guys need moisturizer too.
just a moisturizer that really works
i am so happy i found a moisturizer that works with my skin
on the lookout for a moisturizer that wasn't too greasy
love this eye gel!
now i can apply my concealer
it performs excellent under makeup/concealer.
works great as a light moisturizer
this eye gel really works.
it is perfect under concealer which i have struggled to find one that doesn't have my concealer moving all round all day
i hate having to dab on concealer under my eyes every 4-5 hours
use it with eye moisturizer at night
with the exception of that i could wear under eye concealer
wears well under concealer
i would not say that this is the most hydrating eye cream ever
this is definitely a new essential added to my skincare routine
i put it on before my moisturizer
ready to put concealer on my puffiness is gone
sold soooooo many eye creams
the 100% squalane oil is the only moisturizer i'll put on my face because it feels light
i decided to try this out since i've recently become a huge fan of biossance's new probiotic gel moisturizer
my favorite day cream
gel cream every other evening
i decided to use this under my prescribed moisturizer
i mix it with a lighter moisturizer like cerave pm for easier application
evening in conjunction with my moisturizer
i can safely say it's my new favorite moisturizer
ever since i have used this facial moisturizer i have gotten multiple compliments on my radiant
facial moisturizers are hard to come by since every skin type is different
this moisturizer absrobs in my skin fast
it's a good base for tinted moisturizers in the morning
i layer it over my moisturizer in the winter months
keeps my under eye area from looking dry with concealer
can moisturize on the go
i decided that this is just not working out as a facial moisturizer for me
this is a great moisturizer
more than most moisturizers
this is a very effective and simple moisturizer.
the best moisturizer ever.
this moisturizer is the only one i will use on my face
this is the last layer of my skincare routine
mix it with my lotion
it's great to mix in with your moisturizer
this is a terrific all purpose moisturizer.
lotion is just too thick
the technician advised me to try to use an eye cream to keep the firmness
concealer no longer cakes or creases in this area
it has the ingredients i want in an eye cream
is a great moisturizer for spring/summer
make sure to use a high spf moisturizer with this
my makeup would also pill over it
cruelty-free moisturizer with spf
i love how lightweight this moisturizer is!
just the best moisturizer with spf!
this is a great sunscreen/moisturizer.
(i still used additional moisturizer at night).
this sunscreen is not thick or heavy
this moisturizer is light
i mix it with the drunk elephant sunscreen
mix it with this moisturizer
a must buy for daily moisturizer seekers
i used this moisturizer in one of the sephora beauty classes
i love gel-like moisturizers more than the lotion-like ones
this moisturizer is worth the high price tag.
or too much like a thick lotion
this moisturizer has the perfect texture
sometimes as my day moisturizer
best moisturizer i have ever used.
this is the best moisturizer i have used.
it's a very nice moisturizer
the texture is nicer than any other moisturizer i've tried
i've also noticed an improvement in the chicken-skin like texture that can be enhanced by foundation or concealer application
i do like this cream
decided to splurge on an eye cream
once you touch the cream
i found my concealer wouldn't crease after using this
i do like the eye cream
this is a fabulous eye cream.
i love this eye cream.
i simply love this eye cream
always had to cover up my dark circles with concealer
don't wear enough sunscreen
my eyeshadow doesnt crease as much
the cream is light and not oily.
moisturizer from this br
i've paired this with ole's mattifying moisturizer
decided i needed to get serious about my skincare routine
the accompanying moisturizer which i'm also using
only use a minimal amount of the moisturizer
right before the moisturizer
moisturizer works so well
the sheer transformation moisturizer
i do pair it with the moisturizer
i don't use highlighter anymore
moisturizer now for about 3 weeks
i love this moisturizer for my combination acne prone skin
i mix this with my murad mattifying moisturizer because it has spf in it
it is too heavy for me for a daytime moisturizer in the summer
typically a mattifying moisturizer is a bit too drying for me
tight like a mattifying moisturizer does in me
my combination skin is awful when it comes to finding a moisturizer
have been using this moisturizer in combination with the facewash from the same line
i find that this moisturizer is very lightweight
actually makes me skin feel moisturizer
i took one star off the moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
this is my new holy grail moisturizer!
i love this as a moisturizer.
this is the most mattifying moisturizer i have ever used
this is the best moisturizer for oily skin.
this moisturizer is the best i've ever used.
only use a minimal amount of this moisturizer
right before the moisturizer
i love to use it instead of moisturizer under makeup
the best moisturizer i've ever used!!!
this moisturizer has been amazing for both!
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
use a water-based moisturizer on the bottom half of my face
this moisturizer is absolutely refreshing to apply
this moisturizer is definitely mattifying
i can layer a primer/sunscreen on top
i've tried nearly every moisturizer on the shelf at sephora
this is the only moisturizer i've ever used where it controlled my oils
use a different moisturizer everywhere else
i know one can easily add on an spf sunscreen on top
the right moisturizer will
not only did this moisturizer make my face feel fresh
this is my holy grail moisturizer
firstly, i'm a bit of a moisturizer snob.
i love the feeling of putting on amazing moisturizer after washing my face
this is a great moisturizer if you have super oily skin
this moisturizer did not meet my needs for a night time moisturizer
maybe something more moisturizing for night time use
this moisturizer has helped keep my oil at bay
i really like that this moisturizer isn't heavy
this is a great moisturizer
my favorite thing about this moisturizer is the cooling effect
if you prefer matte
this is a great lightweight moisturizer!
another creme/lotion i use
would 10/10 recommend if you wear light bb cream
this is a very lightweight moisturizer that will be effective for those with oily
i really like this moisturizer
especially moisturizers which can feel heavy on my skin
this is such a great moisturizer for the morning.
i put this moisturizer on my t-zone
my regular moisturizer on my cheeks
this moisturizer goes on as a gel that is soo smooth
enjoyed two other moisturizers under the ole henriksen line
this is a great moisturizer
heavy moisturisers still break me out this one doesn't so for me it's a definite must buy
i personally don't like thicker moisturizers since my skin is pretty oily
i especially love this moisturizer because it is so light
what i love about this product is that it’s a lotion
this moisturizer locks everything in
this is a really great moisturizer.
overall, i really like this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is the perfect medium
this is a nice light moisturizer that absorbs quickly
i mix two drops into my moisturizer am
i don't mix this in with my moisturizer
once again you can always count on clinique for there amazing skincare
it mixes easily into my daytime moisturizer
this is my first retinol product
that happens when you over moisturizer
works very well under concealer
you'll love this cream
this cream is like magic.
makes my concealer look extremely smooth
i am inlove with this eye cream.
this eye cream is amazing!
this eye cream is fabulous!
my concealer still looks good by the end of the day on top of it
i struggle with crepey texture with concealers if my eye cream doesn't work just right
the effect on the skin is that of a crème
lightweight moisturizer during these hot summer days
i know that's a moisturizer too
i like a lightweight cream in the morning that i can layer under my sunscreen
this is a wonderful moisturizer
making it the perfect moisturizer for sensitive skin
it's honestly the best moisturizer i've tried
i've tried sooooooo many tinted moisturizers
it is truly a daily tinted moisturizer/skin tint that gives sheer
it feels like a true moisturizer when its applied
what really surprised me with tinted moisturizer
this is a wonderful product that provides moisturizer
this is the first time i've ever tried a tinted moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer.
thinking it was just another tinted moisturizer
i've tried so many different tinted moisturizers
this is my perfect tinted moisturizer.
i decided to switch up my skincare a bit
this is the only tinted moisturizer that was worked well for me
lightweight tinted moisturizer with sunscreen for every day use
it feels like a moisturizer
5 is also perfect for summer if you are getting more tan or spray tan
is an awesome moisturizer
it goes on like a moisturizer
lightness you'd find in a moisturizer
feels just like my moisturizer
this is my favorite moisturizer.
the lotion is just bad
purchased this very expensive moisturizer
this gel cream is still perfect for me
if i layer this on at night before retinol
i will continue to purchase this fantastic moisturizer
usually when i use a moisturizer
it go well with any moisturizer.
this is one of the most iconic eye creams.
i love the eye balm!
it has drastically reduced my need for under eye concealer
reduces my need for under eye concealer
i am just starting to get into serums
one of the best serums i've tried so happy with this product
i like this serum formula more than any expensive eye cream i use
like with my eye creams
it's not sticky and great under moisturizers.
continue to use my retinol at night
i always put it on right before my moisturizer
i love this cream
it is one that i've found looks great under concealer
i put on concealer
texture would make the concealer look cakey
keeps my concealer looking perfect all day long
i've tried a ton of eye creams
my gosh my skin loves this moisturizer!
i so enjoy using this lightweight cream!
great to wear as a moisturizer on its own
am happy with the amount of moisture it provides under my moisturizer
i apply 2 drops under my am moisturizer
i started wearing sunscreens that made it hard to spread foundation over
is a great primer on your lips prior to applying "matte" liquid lipsticks
no break outs, just good moisturizing.
night as my moisturizer
i mix it with my concealer to get more life out of it
use this as a daily moisturizer
my dry eyes really like it under my concealer
it's a must have for my lips before i apply my matte lipsticks
its a really great moisturizer
use a primer to prevent smudging or invest in waterproof mascara
it gives it a perfect airbrush effect with the glow or i just use it as a moisturizer because it really does moisturize my skin very well
i would recommend this product to anyone looking to give their skin a hydrating boost
it's the best for a lip primer for all of my matte lipsticks
this product is the best moisturizer i have ever used
figured i'd use it in place of my normal argan oil daily routine to moisturize
i still have a need to moisturize them during the day
it was a perfect moisturizer if you want to achieve a dewy look
i've had such consistently good skin i haven't even needed to touch my foundation or concealer
i didn't even need to go in with a moisturizer
i applied a drop to my lips before my matte lipsticks
do not use a creme moisturizer use a gel base one it does not crumble what so ever
i love to go all out concealer bake contour high light
this is the first thing i apply to my face before moisturizers
as far as use for an eyeshadow primer
use the rose elixir as a moisturizer
it's the best as a moisturizer or primer if you have oily skin
f i have a sort of drying concealer
use it as moisturizer and serum and primer.
i don't think it's supposed to be a moisturizer like a few people are using it as although it does moisturize in addition to prime
i used it before my moisturizer
i still like to use light moisturizers in the summer
i would still use moisturizer though.
they advise you to use is before your moisturizer
then my face cream
if used with a good moisturizer
then put some of this on before my moisturizer
lays well under moisturizer
it soothes the dry patches that a normal moisturizer just won't
i would love if they made a moisturizer with this scent
please add the night-time moisturizer to your stock
i just put concealer
make sure to still use a moisturizer to accompany this serum is you is it as skincare
it took off my dior mascara no problem.
expecially my stubborn mascara
it did take off my waterproof mascara
i will continue to use my old fashioned ponds cold cream for the mascara
it takes off my waterproof mascara like a breeze!
i really like this balm.
waterproof eyeliner in one swipe
usually there's always some mascara left over
i prefer liquid to matte lipsticks
everything, including mascara gone!
took all of my waterproof eyeliner
or a little bit of eyeliner
it removes my mascara
benefit they're real mascara on
i really enjoy this balm.
this removes all my waterproof eyeliner
it really does melt away my stubborn mascara/eyeliner
including my waterproof mascara
i wear just eyeliner and mascara everyday.
i do wear waterproof mascara often
a few in my nighttime routine before applying moisturizer
the only other moisturizer that comes slightly close is that is clinique dramatically different gel
it's perfect moisturizer for oily
i will recommend to those who are looking moisturizer for oily skin
this moisturizer is incredible.
she suggested this moisturizer
are desperately seeking a good moisturizer to help
i just figured i should use a moisturizer in the day
have struggled to find a moisturizer that would make my skin soft
this is the best moisturizer i've tried
it's a great moisturizer for my oily
this moisturizer is my new best friend.
it is a perfect moisturizer for sensitive skin
it's a great, lightweight moisturizer.
my favorite daily moisturizer!
my oily skin really agrees with this product as most moisturizers
i like this as a summer morning moisturizer.
it does not have the typical sunscreen scent
it has a light sunscreen scent that i also really enjoy
this moisturizer is awesome.
i love the fact that it's a three in one moisturizer
really does have the consistency similar to that of a sunscreen
no white sheen visible like you see for so many sunscreens
i could never find sunblock that wasn't greasy
it feels more like a lotion than sun screen.
oil free day moisturizer
i tried three spf moisturizers that i absolutely hated based on oiliness
i like it, i use it as my daytime moisturizer!
i look forward to putting on this moisturizer every morning
it left my skin caked with moisturizer the rest of the day
i never get a moisturizer without at least 30 spf
doesn't leave a white residue like most sunscreens on my tan skin tone
i always look for day cream with at least 30 spf
it is not sticky like most spf creams
cause i'm too lazy to apply sunscreen
i can be very sensitive to sunscreens in products
also eyeshadow sticks to it very well.
it's hard to find an eye cream with spf
my under eye concealer applied well over this.
i love that it's a moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer.
this was my first big skincare splurge after graduating from drugstore moisturizers
this moisturizer is lightweight
doesn't pill up when i apply sunscreen over it
this moisturizer is fantastic!
i love this cream
great moisturizer, love it!
i absolutely love this serum/moisturizer.
this takes off my waterproof eyeliner
especially since i wear waterproof mascara to help keep the curl of my lashes
added this to my moisturizer
its my first exfoliating mask i have ever tired
i used a moisturizer after the mask
this is a great eye cream.
i just do the regular moisturizer a few nights to change it up for my skin
my amazing dermatologist is emphatic that i use retinol
this was my first time using a retinol product
this new silk cream is amazing -- i think it's more hydrating that the last one
after i put on my moisturizer
my concealer is undetectable now
i like how it's a gel-like texture: maybe a water gel
shockingly we all agreed it's either this or lemaire no more drugstore products for us at least not to moisturise drugstore products we can stick to an everyday type mascara
it does not pill with makeup application
is my go-to daytime moisturizer
you'll love this cream for daytime use
moisturizer during the day
i can't say enough about this moisturizer!
i switched to the supple moisturizer last fall
i can't say enough about this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is my absolute favorite
i took a chance on this oil-free gel cream
i really love this moisturizer
it's one of the very few oil free moisturizers with spf available
because the lotion is a bit on the thin side
disclaimer: i have used the original take a deep breath moisturizer
it's a basic spf moisturizer with a very subtle
this is by far the best moisturizer with spf that i have ever tried
it just feels like a thin gel like moisturizer!
most moisturizers make my makeup slide right off
it helps to leave my skin matte all day
sometimes have to use a secondary moisturizer
am glad to find a decent moisturizer that does not cause acne
you might need a second moisturizer after this
this acts like a serum to be used before your moisturizer
before my spf/top moisturizer
i absolutely adore this moisturizer.
i just put it under my regular sunscreen.
this is not supposed to be a moisturizer
treat this as a serum which aids the effectiveness of your moisturizer
with whatever moisturizer i use
this moisturizer is simply the best one for me
it is a great moisturizer.
this is a pre-moisturizer
combined with my regular lotion
feel that this doesn't do enough as a moisturizer
i normally get the dramatically different gel moisturizer
finish with the dramatically different gel moisturizer by clinique as well
this is a perfect daytime pre makeup moisturizer for me
found this to be a good contender for a moisturizer
i only gave it 4 stars because i still prefer the dramatically different gel lotion
personally i would never use this as my only moisturizer
then you can layer it with moisturizer
this is a nice lightweight moisturizer.
it layers well under moisturizer
perfect moisturizer for summer.
you put a gel/cream on first
a cream that is applied
the cream alone is amazing.
i do use skincare morning/night daily
so sad you can't find the blue or turquoise pill hydrating sheet masks
i like how this cream goes on gel-like
it goes on like a regular cream
$68 for a moisturizer-that's crazy
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used!
it's one of the most unique moisturizers i’ve ever felt on my face
it's been a struggle to find a moisturizer that will actually moisturize my mostly oily skin
this moisturizer is almost perfect!
moisturizing enough that i can put it on in the day
i usually try to find the next best moisturizer after i'm done with one
this cream is amazing
will forever keep this in my skincare regimen
this cream is great
this moisturizer has completely changed my skin.
this is the perfect moisturizer for they daytime
the water cream is a light weight moisturizer
this will now be my new summer time moisturizer
absolutely love this moisturizer
this moisturizer is just perfect under makeup
this moisturizer is just the right amount of moisture for me
whenever i use this moisturizer it leaves me with baby soft skin
this moisturizer is great for my skin plus it makes pores disappear
it is a wonderful moisturizer
this cream is amazing.
let me tell you this moisturizer is amazing
i made a note that it was on "the silicone side of moisturizers"
this cream is light weight
it's the lightest moisturizer i've ever used.
i decided to try this moisturizer
thought i would spend this much on a moisturizer--
also probably every cream under the sun
iuse it as a day cream on warmer days under sunscreen
because this moisturizer has no oil
i found this moisturizer to be great for me
if you hate greasy or heavy moisturizers
i never thought i would pay this much for a moisturizer
it is my new holy grail moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer!
such a great moisturizer i love it!!!!!!!!!!!
as a oily skin girl creams aren't typically my best friend
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used
if you prefer thick creams or have dehydrated skin this cream isn't for you
in my opinion this would make a great moisturizer for oily skin in the summer
lotions go on my face
this moisturizer really holds true to all of its claims
this moisturizer is simply amazing
i can use this moisturizer with both types of skin days
i can tell the difference in my skin when i don't use this moisturizer
this has been the best moisturizer i have tried
this is my new favorite moisturizer
it works great as a primer as well as a moisturizer because it leaves the skin a little tacky
it seals in all of the fave products i apply prior to my moisturizer
i wear their sunscreen over this
i love how light the texture in this moisturizer is
i would definitely give it a try if you prefer a lightluxe gel moisturizer instead of a heavy cream
it breaks out to almost every moisturizer
this moisturizer however is so light
coming from a moisturizer addict
this moisturizer is at the top of my list
the consistency is gel/cream like
it is such an easy moisturizer to work with.
my new favorite eye cream
my concealer does not budge
this is an amazing moisturizer!
my skin loved this moisturizer
this is my new favorite moisturizer!
thick moisturizer ever again
usually lightweight moisturizers just aren't enough for my skin
i sometimes skip moisturizer in the morning because i have combination skin
i apply moisturizer or serum with sunblock
it makes your skin feel so moisturizer
it is similar to amore pacific gel moisturizer
let this me a staple moisturizer !!!
i'd totally use it as my daily moisturizer as well
i needed a lighter moisturizer for the daytime
this moisturizer is amazing for combo / oily skin types
i've tried so many moisturizers
i feel like it's a good moisturizer for the summer
does an excellent job of acting as a pre-primer moisturizer
at night i pressed it into my skin under my moisturizer
during the day i added a drop to my moisturizer
only put a dab in my moisturizer opposed to pressing it on my face
i find that could skip my moisturizer
i usually just wear concealer
i even wear a very thin layer under my moisturizer
was great under my fresh moisturizer
this is a perfect moisturizer :
a highest moisturizer in like belif aqua bomb
my concealer goes on smooth
the best eye cream i have tried
this is great eye cream.
i do use under eye cream
a concealer primer for undereye
this is a fabulous eye cream
t's 24/7 retinol cream for my eyes for a couple of weeks
my make up doesn't pill up
i do love the skii eye cream sample i got-it is very moisturizing
you don't even have to slather on a separate moisturizer
i love this eye cream.
this has honestly become the most important part of my skincare regimen
as an eye cream
which is not the case for all eye creams
concealer to fade or slip
leaves a really nice base for concealer
my concealer melts into my skin the same as well
i can easily put concealer and eye shadow on top.
concealer again without any creasing
the good part is i can get away with light concealer
you won't waist concealer dabbing
i love using this cream.
the only thing is you will need moisturizer afterwards
it'll be so nice for your skincare routine
using the entire line except for the sunscreens
when i've just got sunscreen on
which is good if you use retinol
i mean even the mascara that i always think i get with other cleansers
was really excited to see that de was going to come out with a gel/jelly cleanser
once i put a moisturizer on it is gone
i wish more skincare had this in it.
i needed a light weight moisturizer
my favorite moisturizer by far!!!
i used the first aid beauty moisturizer for over a year which worked well yes
the exfoliating aspect really makes it feel like it's waking up my skin in the morning
this moisturizer is perfect for the summer time
your skin will thank you for buying this perfect moisturizer
this moisturizer works better than any heavy moisturizer that i have tried
brightens up that under eye area just enough for me to not want to purchase concealer
i love tarte's skincare line
whatever my skincare needs are that's the mask i reach for
the exfoliating mask didn't really have much of an effect on me
so moisturizer is needed afterwards
my favorite part was exfoliating it off!
tbh it doesn't remove waterproof eye makeup or liquid lipstick
even my water proof mascara it comes right off!
you must follow with a moisturizer
it left some mascara behind
i am someone who probably over-exfoliates
it's a lightweight moisturizer with good ingredients
perfect to layer with other vitamin serums for the day
bought this after finishing my clinique gel moisturizer
i wouldn't say it's the heaviest moisturizer i've used
this cream is saving me
i love this cream
it's a great light moisturizer for the summer
it's my new replacement for my origins moisturizer
this light weight moisturizer is perfect for any skin type
i look forward to my nightly skincare routine now because of it
it gets textured if i don't keep up with my skincare
had to be ultra on top of my sunscreen game
it's slowly replacing my typical gel-creme moisturizer
soon learned the trick is to skip your moisturizer
you should always wear sunscreen anyway
i went out today only wearing under-eye concealer
this product is the perfect addition to your skincare regime after a long day in the sun
since it is a gel-like cream
my favorite thing to do at night is a layer of bha toner
helps my moisturizer sink in
it is a light alternative to layering under a serum instead of wearing a moisturizer
this is a nice cleanser that does a pretty good job cleansing all my makeup off with the exception of waterproof mascara
put on my moisturizer
this, plus a good moisturizer is all you need!
so i wear it only at night under my moisturizer.
works with any moisturizer.
i went to sephora to find maybe a night moisturizer antiwrinkle
on my entire face before my moisturizer
this serum paired with origins' mimosa anti- aging moisturizer is a true miracle worker
i've noticed a lovely difference in my skin since adding this to my skincare routine
use it as my serum every morning followed by sunscreen
then apply my am moisturizer
hope in a jar moisturizers
it also shows through my moisturizer
i think i expected it to moisturize like a lotion
i apply just this serum before my moisturizer at night
i think this will definitely become a staple in my skincare routine
it seems to make my moisturizer do a better job
i don't have to use a moisturizer after this
works great with my moisturizer
then applying my night time lotion
i apply it every morning after washing my face before i apply my moisturizer
serums are perfect for the winter months
who doesn't like the feeling of thick cream moisturizers on her face
the help me retinol for night
this is my favorite part of my skincare regimen
i think i've found my new skincare line.
definitely a must have in my night time skincare routine
i put my moisturizer on first and then this mask.
if it were just a moisturizer i would say 5 stars
works best over top of your nightly moisturizer.
i do find that on super dry days i have to layer it with another moisturizer
this is the perfect mask/moisturizer to use overnight
just a bit more than a normal moisturizer
for putting this in my go-to skincare bag
just apply on top of your moisturizer
i love the tarte exfoliator stick
it comes with a cute little applicator that looks kinda like a silicone eyeshadow applicator
i wear a lot of matte lipsticks so
lipstick looks bomb when applied
my very last step is always lipstick
actually moisturizers and stays on all night!
no matter how much matte liquid lipstick abuse i've done to my lips the day before
whether you use liquid lipsticks every day or just a regular chapstick
i wish they made this scent in an all day lip balm or gloss
one day of wearing those type lipsticks
i would have to slather on expensive eye cream
fine lines when i apply liquid lipsticks
my new must have lip moisturizer product..
exfoliate and then put this on top.
this is some really good moisturizer.
i am usually very skeptical about creams
this is probably the best moisturizer i've ever tried
i decided to use 25$ of it to buy the pore refining travel kit by laneige that included this gel moisturizer
great summer or morning moisturizer
you'll have to apply a sunblock with it.
this moisturizer is one that i will definitely be adding
this moisturizer didn't make my nose greasy
this is honestly my favorite moisturizer especially for summer
this moisturizer is an answer to my prayers!
i am obsessed wit how hydrating it is yet it can be applied before makeup without the think feeling of an oil moisturizer
this moisturizer sinks into my skin just like water
i received this moisturizer for review purposes
decided to use it as a daytime moisturizer since i use a heavier night cream on my dry skin
this moisturizer gets the job done
this moisturizer is pretty thick
this is one of the best moisturizers i have ever used
honestly this is an excellent moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer as my night cream.
i put on moisturizer day
it is an amazing moisturizer for dry skin.
for the most part i do love the moisturizer
i don't like moisturizers that have added fragrances to them
this is a great cream!
i would rather spend the extra $$ on a potent serum than a moisturizer
along with that this moisturizer feels so lovely on my skin
only really light/sensitive moisturizers work for me
it heavy for my daily moisturizer
i wanted a cream that was better quality than the average drugstore cream
overall, i'm very happy with this moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer.
it is a great moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer i suffer from dry skin all my life
it's a really nice cream moisturizer.
this has been my go to moisturizer
i am so happy that i was introduced to the laneige moisturizer cream
laniege moisturizer cream met all of my needs
this moisturizer is lightweight
the texture of the moisturizer is thicker than what i expected since the name of it has the word
this is definitely my new favorite moisturizer.
i used this moisturizer every morning
really enjoy this moisturizer for night time use.
i didn't realize the difference a good moisturizer would make to my skin
i am always skeptical of moisturizers because i don't want my skin to get oily
this lotion is rocking
when i first tried this moisturizer
i've tried a ton of moisturizers because i'm typically not a fan of most
it is a great moisturizer!
best moisturizer i've ever used.
definitely has become a new member of my summer skincare routine i love how it is really moisturizing
i think this moisturizer was great
the cream itself is definitely thicker than my everyday moisturizer
definitely not an every day moisturizer for my skin type which is oily
i don't have much experience with moisturizers at this price tag
compared to the olehenriksen sheer transformation® perfecting moisturizer which is $3 more
1 oz of more product i think it's like that moisturizers slightly thicker older sister
i used a perfect world moisturizer from origins
i hate heavy moisturizers
i've used the same moisturizer for years.
i love this moisturizer!
i liked this moisturizer!
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
i would deff recommend this moisturizer to anyone with dry skin or combination
this is the perfect moisturizer for you
i found that this lotion helped my dryness
it layered well under sunscreen
i got this moisturizer from voxbox to try out for free
it's actually becoming one of my favorite moisturizers
i love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is great.
i am very picky with the type of moisturizer i use
most creams i have tried will moisturize when i use it
not keep it moisturizer all day
every time i use this cream it make my skin feel very dewy
i love using this moisturizer on my really dry days
the cream is nice
this moisturizer is ideal for someone with mildy/ moderately dry skin
lightweight moisturizer that doesn't break me out is usually a struggle
this is a really lovely moisturizer for daily use
i promise you this will change the way you look at moisturizers
i enjoy this moisturizer a lot!
i do not appreciate moisturizers that leave me feeling greasy
i liked this as a nighttime moisturizer as i have oily skin
prefer an spf in my day cream
i love the feel of the moisturizer.
i've really been enjoying this moisturizer.
i've always been a huge fan of my first aid moisturizer
it has turned out to be my new favorite moisturizer
finding the right moisturizer that really works
i like this cream for the summer.
this moisturizer is really nice and light.
this moisturizer is awesome!
keihls facial moisturizer is my go to product when it comes to face creams
neck with my holy grail ultra facial moisturizer
now it is one of my favorite night time moisturizer
not when i used this as my moisturizer before applying the foundation
i know cream is meant for dry skin while gel is for oily
maybe that would do enough so that i can also use a gel moisturizer in the morning
a lot of moisturizers are heavy
the moisturizer was light
i love an intense moisturizer that is also light weight enough to wear all day
even my waterproof mascara
i definitely have to put moisturizer on right after using this
this moisturizer is lightweight
creams that firm or moisturizer or illuminate
this is a lovely, lightweight moisturizer.
it's a really lovely summer moisturizer
i really love this moisturizer
rich moisturizer on my face during the day
prior i used cauldine moisturizer
i will definitely be adding this as my go-to moisturizer in my skincare routine
i struggled finding a moisturizer
this is an amazing moisturizer.
i got a sample size of this moisturizer
i tried a sample of this moisturizer
this moisturizer is perfect for anytime wear.
this moisturizer is truly a dream
this moisturizer breaks the mold
this moisturizer is so versatile
honestly i'm in love with this moisturizer.
it's the perfect balance between a heavy moisturizer
although it isn't the thickest moisturizer
i always follow up with moisturizer
if i were oily i would finish off with a gel moisturizer
so after i rinsed off this mask i patted into my skin 3 drops of drunk elephant's luxury virgin marula oil as my moisturizer
i switched my entire skin care regimen over to tatcha products after consulting with a skincare speculate at tatcha about what the perfect skincare regimen would be for my age
the de sukari baby facial weekly is a lovely supplement to my daily skincare regimen
until i met new ginzing spf40 tinted moisturizer
love this new tinted moisturizer with spf.
perfect all-in-one lightweight tinted moisturizer with spf that literally makes my skin glow
it is truly just a tinted moisturizer.
this is favorite moisturizer now for the day time h
a moisturizer that has a little bit of a tint.
i think people are missing the point of this moisturizer
the formula color matches to your skin
use this as a moisturizer/primer before i put my foundation on
it was my first time using a tinted moisturizer
i've tried a few other tinted moisturizer samples since
i love this moisturizer!
i regularly use origins ginzing moisturizer
you can always add bronzer.
i've used the ginzing eye cream
was in the store for a new sunscreen/tinted moisturizer
if you use the proper amount it's still more lightweight than most tinted moisturizers
i should have been looking at tinted moisturizers
a great everyday lightweight formula with spf 30
has the ability to be worn fairly sheer like a tinted moisturizer
liquid matte lipstick had to start from someone
i typically use it cosmetics bb cream in medium-tan
sunblock all in one product
i felt like i didn't really need moisturizer
i barely needed any moisturizer after application
didn't need any additional moisturizer with this
it left my face feeling moisturizer.
would still need some crème
eye crème to apply after this product
my skin has never felt more moisturizer
works really well under a light moisturizer at night
i won't say its a great product as i wish itd be more moisturizing
it's like perfume for my face with extra benefits of making my skin better
don't put any moisturizer on top
i think it's a great addition to a skincare regimen
i don't even feel the need to moisturize with this product
i got lamer's all lotions
this is the best lotion i have ever had
this moisturizer does not make me look more oily
i noticed my concealer went on without any effort
it doesn't over dry my skin as long as i'm using a moisturizer with it
night before my moisturizer for a day
it's working beautifully for me before i use my daily moisturizer
i find that it layers well with most of my skincare
made my concealer go on like a dream
i really like this moisturizer.
before using this moisturizer
my go-to for the summer was the clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel which left my face matte
i would definitely recommend their skincare line
the texture of this moisturizer is amazing!
this gel moisturizer is light
it works as both a skin moisturizer
i'd been searching for a good moisturizer for years
i love this moisturizer!
doesn't make my face feel like its covered in moisturizer
volition's oceane gel is one of the best moisturizers i've used
it is also a great moisturizer to use in my its own
i struggled to find a moisturizer that made my skin radiant without being greasy
i am in love with this addition to my skincare routine
even with the lightweight properties of this moisturizer
i’ve read that not only does it promises to moisturize
i love this as a primer and undereye gel.
this moisturizer doesn't irritate at all
this product doesn't leave your skin feeling dry after you've applied it like other moisturizers ive used
it works so beautifully with concealer
acting as a primer under concealer
my under-eye concealer seems to apply
this eye gel is so light weight
i love how this eye cream doubles as an undereye primer
i love how my concealer goes on very smooth with this
it went great under my concealer
after using this my concealer stayed put all day with zero creases
this is one of the best eye creams/gels i've ever used
save my heavier eye creams for at night
as a professional makeup artist i love how i'm able to use this gel as an under eye primer before applying concealer to get a clean creaseless application
this eye gel is super light
i love that it's gel formula instead of cream
goes perfectly well on the skin as a moisturizing cream or as a primer for eye makeup
or eye gel person
my concealer doesn't crease like it did prior to using this gel
that of course is a disaster when i apply concealer under my eye areahave been using this eye gel for a good two weeks
is the perfect base for my concealer
my concealer hasn't been creasing
it helps my concealer last longer.
also this eye gel is someone's baby.
i've used it everyday with my moisturizer before applying makeup
so wearing concealer can be a challenge.
i generally use a more moisturizing eye cream as a base for concealer
it creates a perfect base for concealer
i love this eye cream.
(i follow it with a cream concealor.)
i love this super cooling eye-gel especially in the mornings before makeup
my concealer won't apply
so this gel is perfect
i can wear an eye gel during the day without mascara smearing around my eyes
probably one of the best eye creams i've ever used
i love this eye cream
this gel cream is so light weight!
i put it on after moisturizer
it can be used as a day cream and night cream.
am so picky with face moisturizers when it comes to consistency
this is one of the best face moisturizers i have found
this is probably one of my favorite skincare br
it is a great moisturizer base for any type of foundation
kiehls does have a blue color packaging gel moisturizer great for summer use
i am beyond obsessed with this moisturizer!
this is the only moisturizer that hasn't broken me out
this is hands down my favorite moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer for the mornings.
this is my all-time favorite moisturizer.
are having trouble finding the right moisturizer for you
one of my favourite undereye creams.
my eye area could use extra tlc than just a moisturizer does
this is the best eye cream i've ever used!
also before i apply concealer
this eye cream is so amazing.
feels like a thin moisturizer
possibly one of the only sunscreens that doesn't break me out
this moisturizer has been my go to forever.
it doesn't feel sticky like regular sunscreen
although it looks a little greasy like sunscreen
i got it in my eye one night mixed with eyeshadow/mascara/foundation/foamy cleanser mixture
it's left mascara on my lashes
i finally found a moisturizer that protects
i love this facial cream !!!
concealer no longer looks cakey when i apply it since i've been using this eye cream
best night eye cream i've ever used!
i love this cream!
this cream lasts a while
it's the best moisturizer i've tried out in over a year
best moisturizer i've ever used
this is my new favorite moisturizer!
waterproof mascara is no match for this stuff.
've tried my fair share of eye creams
applying moisturizer because my skin would start to crack
then this gel is for you
this is now a pernanent part of my skincare routine
you have to make sure to apply a nourishing moisturizer the next day though
my moisturizer seems to work better
then apply some lotion to my face
i ran out of the moisturizer
haven't felt the need to add a moisturizer on top
this is really the best exfoliator i have ever tried
follow up with a moisturizer a while later
the moisturizer i use afterward absorbs much better in my skin
would wear corrective green cream
just make sure you guys use a moisturizer after using this product
started using retinol cream with the only change being dry flaky skin
advise following this with a moisturizer
best everlove it better than botox
then add a nice moisturizer over it
i apply a moisturizer over top as ahas can be drying i wake up to even texture
then apply a layer of calming moisturizer
some which even concealer wouldn't cover up
i think it is a wonderful exfoliator for me
i follow with a moisturizer after it's dried a bit
put a moisturizer on top
do the same with my night moisturizer
i always wake up with softer skin especially when used with a moisturizer
before my night moisturizer
i prefer to use my truth creme for every night use
would follow this with a moisturizer just to be safe
creams on top of it
i stumbled across this moisturizer at sephora
i love this moisturizer
love this moisturizer is great for morning
this moisturizer did not break me out
this moisturizer is amazing.
this moisturizer is the absolute best that i have ever used
so refreshing before this cream
this is a great face lotion for sensitive skin.
come back to this lotion
great moisturizer for daily use!
one of my favorite moisturizers.
even some nights after i wash my face when i want something lighter than my hydrating night lotions
sensitive skin this may not be the moisturizer for you
this moisturizer is perfect
loves this moisturizer also
for the rest of the year this is my favorite go-to moisturizer
this is definitely my new got-to moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer did miracles to my skin
i really like this lotion.
this one is much thicker than the sheer transformation lotion
i really love this moisturizer.
the few days i didn't use this moisturizer my skin was visibly more dry
i love this moisturizer :) i have extremely !!!
i love this moisturizer!
i wanted a moisturizing cream that i could use after the truth serum
the problem was the sheer transformation isn't really a "moisturizer" for dry sensitive skin
in no way does this tiny bit of powder harm the moisturizing of this creme
my favorite moisturizer of all time.
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
after trying so many moisturizer this ones the best
i love this moisturizer!
i love this cream.
the only downside for me is that it smells like baby aspirin
best skin lotion ever
the perfect every day face lotion
absolutely love this moisturizer!
this cream is amazing
by far, my favorite moisturizer by ole.
i just love this moisturizer.
this has become one of my favorite moisturizers
ive seen blemishes disappear after a week of applying this moisturize morning
this is an amazing moisturizer for dry
this is the first moisturizer that i've used that actually calms my skin
i've never had better results from a moisturizer alone
this is my favorite moisturizer right now.
this is the only moisturizer that keeps my skin dry throughout the entire day
mix it in with a bit of sunscreen
this moisturizer is so divine!
will never go back to my other plain moisturizer!
this is my favorite face cream
never have i had a moisturizer work so well on my skin
this moisturizer is a dream come true
this is the only moisturizer that could hydrate my skin for a full day
combined with the vitamin pluss moisturizer
i just change my moisturizer based on the season.
it'd be even more perfect if it had exfoliating properties
you can always use a moisturizer
this cleanser is a bit drying so don't skip applying a moisturizer
they both would leave streaks of mascara
it is a great moisturizer for day
i cannot recommend this moisturizer enough!
hands down the best moisturizer i've tried
the ole henriksen sheer transformation perfecting moisturizer is a lightweight smooth moisturizer that i really like on my sensitive skin
i can recommend this if you would like a lightweight moisturizer
this moisturizer is lightweight
this moisturizer is great for my skin
this moisturizer truly helped my skin look
i am so shook with the moisturizer.
was scared to check out moisturizers
it is my go to moisturizer.
using this moisturizer daily under my makeup has fixed that problem
this is my new go to moisturizer!
i think i finally found a moisturizer that keeps it happy
this lotion is amazing!!
the lotion also lasts forever!
if you love this lotion definitely try out the gel for night time skin routine before the lotion
it is so lightweight it almost feels like i'm not wearing any moisturizer
this moisturizer was used on me during a makeover
this moisturizer is so good
i love mixing this moisturizer with my foundation to create a light-weight faux bb cream feel
i gave it 4 stars because i cannot use it as a night moisturizer as it isn't hydrating enough
this moisturizer made my skin so smooth
this moisturizer i use ptr retinol pm eye cream too
the best moisturizer i've ever used.
oil-free moisturizer has changed my complexion completely
i love this moisturizer sooooo much!

the moisturizer has reduced my acne
hate using cream moisturizers

this moisturizer not only makes skin soft
i highly recommend this moisturizer.
the only moisturizer that works on my skin.
this is my go-to moisturizer for daytime
i added this moisturizer to my routine day/night
a definite go-to moisturizer for normal/combo skin
apply this cream after
this moisturizer is really light
whenever i apply foundation after this moisturizer
it never balls up with any of my previous moisturizers
this is the only moisturizer i've been able to use under makeup
moisturizers always make me break out.
i ran out of my normal go to moisturizer
i really liked this moisturizer!
don't normally use moisturizer
this moisturizer is perfect for my oily skin.
this is the best moisturizer i've used
i am in love with this moisturizer
rich moisturizers that is until i got this as a sample
this moisturizer has been a miracle in a tub
i feel like with other moisturizers i have to use twice as much
this moisturizer is great for combination skin!
moisturizer soft skin i am on my second container
it is a bit too light to use as a night moisturizer right now
this is a very light moisturizer.
i am absolutely in love with this moisturizer!
feels like a great moisturizer
continue to use it in combination with my spf moisturizer
really great transformative moisturizer.
this moisturizer is so light
it's a nice light moisturizer
this is my new hg moisturizer.
i would not recommend as a pm moisturizer
i got the mini point perk of this moisturizer without any expectations
tends to like a more lightweight moisturizer/lotion
i add this before my moisturizer in the morning
night usage of this moisturizer
tried so many moisturizers
no sunscreen which i have found makes moisturizers too thick
this is my new fav/can't live without moisturizer
i will probably supplement with a thicker/heavier cream in the winter
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used
this is my favorite moisturizer.
this moisturizer worked amazing
this moisturizer is just plain amazing.
is light enough to go under a moisturizer or sunscreen
i mix it with a little bit of face lotion
a nightly moisturizer at night
as long as you put moisturizer on after this
goes well with my moisturizer
then i put my moisturizer
the do daily moisturizer.
this with my trusty fab ultra repair moisturizer did the trick
i can use a lot less foundation/concealer now that i've used this for a little while
i decided to spend on skincare instead
then proceed with my moisturizer/sun screen
don't have a problem using this under moisturizer/makeup
i do follow up with a moisturizer.
have to wait a little before i put moisturizer on
however it is not a substitute for moisturizer.
then use moisturizer on top after drying
sheer transformation perfecting moisturizer
i love using it before my moisturizer!
after toner and before moisturizer.
in the morning before moisturizer
night after all my moisturizers
i top it off with the ole henriksen orange moisturizer
the truth reveal moisturizer in the morning
it helps keep the moisturizer in all day
typically in the morning because i use another exfoliating serum at night
concealer could not cover
i don't use anything special on my skin besides a good moisturizer
you have to use a moisturizer afterwards
top it off with a heavy moisturizer
have a really hard time finding a moisturizer
the quality of this moisturizer is great
the formula of the moisturizer is very lightweight
i love this moisturizer!!!
i read previous reviews that said this moisturizer made them more oily
i love this moisturizer.
i started using the advanced truth moisturizer from the a brighter truth kit
it is my holy grail moisturizer
i've always struggled with moisturizers as my skin is naturally so oily
its almost like a gel-cream
you may not find this moisturizer to be very mattifying
is one of few moisturizers that doesn't cause me to break out
the consistency of this moisturizer isn't too thick
this moisturizer is amazing probably best for oily to combination skin
this moisturizer is a godsend!
i can slather it on
this moisturizer is perfect.
this cream is a mattifying cream
this cream however is light
i've changed my moisturizer to this
this is by far the best moisturizer i have ever tried
it is now my daily moisturizer
a half now as a day moisturizer
i ordered this because philosophy discontinued my favorite moisturizer
when i first tried this new moisturizer
the old moisturizer sat on top of my skin.
i would change my moisturizer as soon as i finished the jar to a different br
finding a moisturizer that worked with my sensitive
i tend to switch to a lighter moisturizer during the day
this is the absolute best moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used on my face
i needed a light moisturizer
what an amazing day moisturizer for oily skin.
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
am very particular of which moisturizer i will use
s down the best moisturizer i have used
i met the one true love: this moisturizer
of all of ole's moisturizers this is my favorite for my skin
needed a fuss free moisturizer to give moisture to my dry areas
one of the sales associates recommended this ole moisturizer
if the lotion is too irritating
this moisturizer is somehow able to make my skin look amazing--combined with the grease relief face tonic
first time trying this moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
the consistency of this moisturizer is amazing.
instead of feeling like a heavy lotion or cream
this moisturizer smells great
this cream is amazing.
truth serum, then vitamin plus moisturizer.
i decided to purchase a moisturizer to incorporate into my current skin care routine
i don't think the moisturizer is bothering my skin
low for a moisturizer that isn't heavy
i know how important it is to use a moisturizer.
to get a moisturizer that worked i would
i love this moisturizer!
i worked this cream into my skin care routine
i found the step 3 "lotion" very harsh
decided to try out this particular cream to replace the clinique lotion
this moisturizer has saved my skin
i really do love this moisturizer
so often a good moisturizer is hard to find
i needed an spf free moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer for my combination skin
t is often hard to find a good moisturizer
excellent moisturizer as makeup base
they are the main ingredients in this moisturizer
this is a good moisturizer
great moisturizer for combination
this is my all time favorite moisturizer.
the only other moisturizer i found with all these vitamins was the camu camu moisturizer by ptr
how lightweight this lotion is
this cream is great- lightweight
most moisturizers aren't heavy enough
this has been the best lotion i've found
this is one of the few moisturizers that helps to control my oily skin throughout the entire day
this moisturizer smells amazing
began using this moisturizer as my primer
not quite as deep-down moisturizing as the truth revealed moisturizer
i chose to buy the vitamin plus lotion over the truth serum lotion because i thought that it would go better with my skin type
just added this vitamin plus as an alternate moisturizer at night
this lotion is perfect for my sensitive skin.
i would recommend this lotion to anyone with sensitive skin
i love this cream.
my skin loves this moisturizer.
this is one of the best creams i've tried.
this creme is the truth.
then used a tinted moisturizer on top
gave my tinted moisturizer application a super smooth finish
fresh should make a crème ancienne body butter!
i love this cream
wish i cold say the same about sunscreen
this is the best cream i've ever used!
definitely more so a night cream than a day cream
i just wish i could afford to spend 200 on a moisturizer
my dry skin will laugh at those lightweight crèmes
this moisturizer is simply amazing.
i would have given 5 stars if it contained sunscreen
i can top it with make up that contains sunscreen
i love this eye cream.
using crème ancienne adds a little puffiness to my eyes that were really tired
i know there is an eye cream formula
this is the ultimate antiaging creme
this moisturizer is the best.
now i'm also using it in the morning followed by a facial sunscreen
the best moisturizer i've ever had.
this moisturizer keeps it smooth all day long
it is the most wonderful moisturizer i have ever used
it's a great night time moisturizer
this is the greatest most intense moisturizer i have ever used
try this before botox!
this is an amazing moisturizer
it's one of best cream to reduce your wrinkles
this cream is super thick
definitely not a good daytime moisturizer.
i do like this as a night time moisturizer since i have very dry skin
this cream is good enough to use also as an eye cream
this is the best face creme i have used.
i've tried a bunch of different moisturizers
break out from moisturizers
i get a bit oily from a lot of moisturizers
you get to choose what sunblock to use
i love this cream!
this is less of a cream and more of a balm.
use a light moisturizer in the morning
the smell is one of the things i like about this moisturizer
my objective is to moisturizer my face
this is the only product that can moisturizer my skin without giving me a bad breakout
i can feel myself washing the moisturizer off
only cream i can use with my skin type.
this moisturizer does amazing things for my skin!
this has been my go-to moisturizer for years
would like a nice lighter moisturizer i would give this a shot
i fell in love with the entire philosophy line after using this moisturizer
this moisturizer is simply put amazing.
also when i first purchased this moisturizer
this moisturizer makes my skin feel soft
this moisturizer is lightweight-- doesn't make your skin feel greasy
i wear it as a night cream
i also care more about a moisturizer working well than smelling well
this is one of my favorite go-to moisturizers that i can use all year round
this moisturizer feels so nice on my skin.
i originally wanted to get this korres moisturizer
thought i'll try this moisturizer
absorbs quickly almost like a gel moisturizer except it has a cream texture look
this is my favorite face moisturizer.
which is what most moisturizer do
my face all around looks best with this moisturizer
this is one of the best moisturizers i have ever used
the moisturizer has a nice consistency.
i love the consistency of this moisturizer.
take a deep breath is my regular moisturizer
the main thing i like about this moisturizer is its very creamy texture
nonetheless it makes as a great backup moisturizer to my regular one
i love having the mini sized tub to keep in my purse for moisturizer on the go
5 stars for basic moisturizer
this is a dependable moisturizer that i use for night
i like to use a moisturizer with spf for during the day
this lotion is amazing
this is a lightweight moisturizer
this cream does just that.
i love this moisturizer!
it is a great "primer" for a tinted moisturizer or foundation
doesn't give you a heavily moisturizer feeling
this moisturizer is a perfect fit for me
this is a great moisturizer for normal or combo skin
i love this moisturizer.
i really really love this moisturizer
i love/hate this moisturizer!!
have always had trouble with moisturizers
this has been my go to face moisturizer for years
i've tried so many moisturizers
i tried cheaper moisturizer
i also don't use any foundation or makeup on my skin other than moisturizer/spf
always use sunscreen or stay in the shade
just make sure to use a sunscreen during the day!
this was my first time using a retinol product.
wanted to take my skincare regimen "up a notch" to fight off the wrinkles i started seeing on my face
it's important to follow with a moisturizer per the directions
you want to "seal in" the retinol against your skin
that i don't need to use as much moisturizer at night
just make sure to apply a moisturizer beforeh
this is my first experience using retinol
i wear a sunscreen without a retinoid
its always good to have retinol on your nightly skin care
this is not a moisturizer.
you will have to use a moisturizer as well as this product
most of the time i don't feel like i need a moisturizer after
i highly recommend this if you want a gentle dose of retinol to clear
usually use moisturizer over it
i started using this retinol cream
i actually use it in the mornings after washing my face/showering as a moisturizer
this cream balances out my skin
of course, i use sunscreen, as well.
i've had to invest in a pure sunscreen.
i heard its never to early to start using a retinol based cream
it says to follow up with a moisturizer
've stopped using a moisturizer after
do not put this in top of your pm moisturizer
wear it underneath your pm moisturizer
also make sure to use sunscreen.
sephora's mattifying moisturizer with spf 20 is nice
before my nighttime moisturizer
retinol is probably one of the best skin must haves for everyone
hope in a jar original moisturizer
don't have to wait to apply a moisturizer
this cream definitely is
a new part of my daily skin regimen
go through a single tube of anything whether it's a moisturizer
have to make sure i top it off with a little moisturizer
i just use a tinted primer or moisturizer.
didnt need a whole lot of "help" a side from a good moisturizer
can put a moisturizer almost right after
it is a great moisturizer
i put my night time moisturizer over top.
i learned that only retinol can do the trick
moisturizer as it made my face break out
i probably shouldn't have used the retinol every night
the "help me" retinol cream is awesome.
then top with hope in a jar moisturizer
t is ideal to use before applying concealer
it is cheaper than a lot of eye creams/gels
she said this would go well under concealer/makeup
my other eye creams are too heavy or oily it will take a while to absorb before applying concealers
great everyday eye cream.
i love this eye cream.
i love this cream!
i love this eye gel!
this eye cream does wonders!
really adds moisture to my under-eye area before i put on my concealer
i never use concealer so i was pointed to this.
my morning skin regimen is pretty basic: eye gel followed by the lotus moisturizer
i don't feel it's a great moisturizer
she was looking at the eye creams
love this eye gel.
this cream is good
this eye gel works well for me.
it is cooling, and doesn't make my mascara run!
during the day if i need extra moisture i use amazing concealer over it- fantastic
i always have a problem with runny mascara from eye creams
i like this eye gel
just a good eye moisturizer for nothing too heavy
the consistency is just like any type of lotion
use this as my day cream
i am able to keep clear skin if i use a bare minimum-type oil free moisturizer with a salicylic acid acne wash
it's very close to my favorite sisley creams
i absolutely love this moisturizer
this was the first real moisturizer i ever used
i've used this particular moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer for normal to dry skin ever
i love this moisturizer its one of the best
i've used this moisturizer for several years
i love this moisturizer so much.
caudalie has always been my go to moisturizer.
this moisturizer is so soft
i love this cream.
it's my favorite moisturizer by far
this was her favorite moisturizer
this is really great moisturizer.
the best moisturizer for dry or extremely dry skin
my favorite moisturizer has been discontinued
this moisturizer even better!
this has been one of the most luxurious moisturizers i've ever used
i recently started using this cream as a night cream
i love this because it really does moisturize!
this is my go-to moisturizer when i don't need something with spf
this moisturizer definitely does the trick
i recently purchased this moisturizing cream at the sephora in soho
the cream is so light weight
i love this cream.
this moisturizer works great on my combination skin
in the winter a thicker moisturizer at night might be needed
the caudalie toning lotion in conjunction are now must haves for me
i wait two minutes after i apply this moisturizing cream to my face
i love this moisturizer.
wonderful moisturizer that can be used year-round
i absolutelly love this cream.
this is a wonderful moisturizer for dry skin.
this moisturizer keeps my skin soft
i love that cream !
at first i was in love with the creme sorbet moisturizer they have
this moisturizer repaired my dry skin within a day
this moisturizer is my absolute favorite
doesn't leave skin oily like some other moisturizers
definitely a new lover of this moisturizer
s down one of if not the best moisturizer i have ever used
i actually think this moisturizer makes my skin glow
i love the smell of this moisturizer
shine or heavy weight of other daily moisturizers
summer… i will never change moisturizers again
this is a fantastic moisturizer.
i like this moisturizer in the warmer months.
my skin loves this moisturizer !
i love this moisturizer
i remember when i didn’t use this phenomenal moisturizer
it’s just a plain old moisturizer
this is one of the more affordable moisturizers from caudalie
creamy moisturizer, which i use in the am and pm.
in the winter i am constantly reapplying moisturizer
i put my moisturizer on after i was my face
with this lotion i don't have that problem
a sales associate recommended this moisturizer to me
it's more of a cream than a lotion
since it is a tad pricy compared to other moisturizers
i love this moisturizer.
it provides the perfect amount of moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer that doesn't irritate my skin
this lotion was great at bringing the moisture back in my skin
i love the moisturizer.
this lotion is a great moisturizer that keeps your skin soft
from all the moisturizers i have tried
it is very lightweight yet a great moisturizer.
this creme is really excellent
underneath my shiseido spf 55 lotion for the day
it's a creme with the lightness of a lotion.
this is a great moisturizer if you're skin is slightly dry
works better or just as good as the really expensive moisturizers
i like that this product doesn't have sunscreen
use this cream day
this moisturizer has been my saving grace
my combination/sensitive skin loves this moisturizer so much
this is a wonderful face cream.
was needing a moisturizer at the time
i love this cream.
this moisturizer is amazing!!
the only thing is i wish it had sunscreen
first moisturizer i've used that is both effective
it the only moisturizer that doesn't break out my skin
i really like this cream.
this cream is light
its perfect for an purse moisturizer
is it's just the mascara
moisturized enough that i don't even need to slather on lotion after
wonderful additional to my skincare routine!
i pair this with the vinosource moisturizer or josie miran argan oil
find daily moisturizers to be a hit-or-miss game
for me it just means i have to use less moisturizer afterwards
do not need to use much moisturizer afterward
i don't have to moisturizer as much
i just consider that the first layer of moisturizer for my dry skin
doesn't remove lipstick and mascara much.
all except waterproof mascara
afterwards i use a light moisturizer
along with a great moisturizer
seriously if you want a cleanser that takes your mascara off girl
use a toner/moisturizer to wrap things up.
i can actually leave my house with no more then some concealer
clean make sure you follow up with a face moisturizer
i also use the moisturizer!
sunscreen really well without stripping your skin
will be getting the moisturizer
moisturizers a year so my face doesn't get used to it
always follow up with a moisturizer
in the morning after moisturizer
leave it to dry for a few minutes before adding any moisturizer
i recommend that you blend it into your moisturizer
this is more of a preventative eye cream.
concealer and correct goes on flawlessly now.
this is like a gel-cream
makes my concealer look better
this makes the application of concealer easier.
i do like the feel of the gel-cream
thinking a good moisturizer should be all i need
at the end of the day, it's $40 for lotion.
my concealer went on a lot smoother
will i buy lotion for my dark circles again?
don't need a heavy duty eye cream
i like that for a night eye cream
my concealer goes on nicely
will go back to using a more nourishing eye cream at night
aside from being an excellent moisturizer
i really enjoy this eye cream.
i am sensitive to a lot of eye creams.
while i could overlook that part if the cream did a nice job of moisturizing
it reduces them enough where i can use a regular liquid concealer versus a heavier cream product before using a highlighting concealer
i love this eye cream.
remember: do not rub your eye cream!
i love this eye cream
this is a fabulous eye cream
i love the boscia eye cream.
it mixes well with concealer so that's not a huge issue
most moisturizers make the skin feel like it is burning
such a lovely, light eye area moisturizer.
this is brilliant for day wear under concealer
i liked this eye cream.
this cream is amazing
i do love this eye cream.
it isn't too slippery like some eye creams that make it hard to put on concealer
over the years i have tried many eye moisturizers
this eye cream is gentle
it maikes my eyeliner smudge a bit.
leaves the area prepped for concealer
i just needed a simple moisturizer that would help repair the damage
this is a very nice gel-like eye cream.
you can use concealer
still feel the moisture under the concealer
it's one of the best eye creams i've used.
i like the consistance of this eye moisturizer.
it is more like a gel
this is not my favorite eye cream
especially under-eye concealers
gels that don't do much for fine wrinkles
did this cream change my view on moisturizer!
this moisturizer def does more then any other moisturizer i have used
wants an amazing moisturizer that brightens
this moisturizer goes on so well.
dry skin always going for a good moisturizer
great moisturizer for night.
this moisturizer is so light and smells amazing!
best moisturizer everrrrrrrr❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ just love it
this 24 hr moisturizer is what i use during the day
a little goes a long way with this moisturizer.
i always try to get different moisturizers with my points
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
i hate dewy feeling moisturizers that leave a film
one of the best moisturizers i've used.
s down the best moisturizer i have ever tried
so far i am in love with this moisturizer.
pampering myself with something luxurious
i apply this cream
i just rock the left over moisturizer
this moisturizer absolutely works
i got this moisturizer initially in a sephora favorites kit
i really like this cream!
best moisturizer i've ever used
i used the serum with this moisturizer
i never do well with moisturizers
i like this moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer!

the heaviest of moisturizers doesn't work
this is a must in my skin care routine because it truly is the ultimate moisturizer
it's my hg moisturizer
i love this cream.
i love this moisturizer.
this is such a great moisturizer!
i am so happy to find this great cream that moisturize the face over night
i used the clinique gel lotion which i love in the warmer weather
this has got to be one of my favorite moisturizers
this moisturizer is probably the best moisturizer i've found for underneath makeup for my makeup
most moisturizers i've used for my combo-dry skin make my skin look greasy
i wake up so moisturizer
the holy grail of under foundation moisturizers.
after struggling for years to find a perfect moisturizer for my sensitive skin which is a combination type
this cream is amazing
i find the korres cream is not especially good at moisturizing--the cream seems to sit on top of the skin rather than get absorbed by the skin
i really like this cream.
it helps that i also use the night time facial moisturizer
i began using this moisturizer
this moisturizer has a nice
i've found that this moisturizer is a little more intense
last winter i experienced the worst skin dryness/breakouts imaginable so this year i decided to spend the money on a good moisturizer
i love this moisturizer for my day to day.
i love this cream
this moisturizer does not break me out
i love this moisturizer!
a great cream for summer!
f your not a fan of scented moisturizers from the get go
i love this face cream!
i noticed that moisturizer is a bit heavy for the day time
it has a consistency similar to sunscreen.
this is by far the best moisturizer i've ever used
the woman in sephora recommended this lotion!
i apply the lotion generously at night
this works well as moisturizer am
i used belif's hydrobomb cream before
it doesn't go against my other routine moisturizers
am absolutely in love with this moisturizer
can't use a moisturizer for dry skin cuz i breakout
at this point this moisturizer has done it's job
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer works very well
i love this moisturizer.
i don't look for other moisturizers anymore
even the most stubborn waterproof mascara comes right off
even stubborn mascara comes off.
makeup including my mascara
it is not good at removing mascara.
do recommend moisturizer after
i topped it off with the hope in a jar moisturizer
it gets off all my mascara
mineral sunscreen off easily
it doesn't remove all my waterproof mascara
'll keep using n loading on that moisturizer
i've never tried it with waterproof mascara
that's nothing a light moisturizer can't fix
when all there is to wash off is moisturizer
small issues are improved past the need for concealer from my morning wash
it takes off mascara very well
it is very important to use a moisturizer after useing this as well as sunblock
mascara which i really needed
put moisturizer on afterwards
moisturizers in the past year trying to help my skin
*i also purchased the murad redness therapy moisturizer too
now i only need a little bit of concealer for day long wear
it works great along with the moisturizer
i can easily apply moisturizer or sunscreen after a short period of time
i also do use a daily face moisturizer with spf on top of the serum to help moisturize
the instructions say to apply this first then apply a moisturizer on top
goes on smoothly and is used under a moisturizer.
i want a serum rather than lotion.
my boyfriend have been using the spf 15 lotion for a year
i don't need as much concealer or powder.
this is a great cream.
i feel it is very important in a daily face lotion
i let it dry before applying moisturizer
this is one of my favorite serums
evening followed by moisturizer
definitely a must for your beauty regimen
fresh umbrian clay moisturizer during the day
in combo with the umbrian clay moisturizer
best of best: it has a touch of retinol
use my toner- i then follow with my eye cream
i don't use sunscreen
although i do feel funny putting the active ingredient of antiperspirant on my face
works great under your moisturizer
even concealer was not enough to hide them
some sensitive skin products don't have enough moisturizer
this moisturizer paired with the kakadu c cleanser is the first time i have been acne free in 20 years
it is also an excellent moisturizer
i can also wear my prescription cream underneath it
this is by far my favorite moisturizer
we apply this morning before the sunscreen
this is the perfect summer moisturizer!
the moisturizer is a gel-like cream
'm not slathering on concealer
i love the cream.
i agree with others that this cream is not enough of a moisturizer on its own
i layer a moisturizer over it
this lotion worked within a few applications
this moisturizer is amazing.
treatments with no luck until i found this miracle cream
so you are not wasting any of the lotion
this moisturizer lasts a lot longer
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer works amazing
i know that moisturizers aren't the treatment step
my skin gets oily with too much moisturizer
don't like heavy creams
calm after applying this moisturizer
this is the only lotion that does not irritate my skin
i put it on under other moisturizers
it is not the most expensive moisturizer i've bought
i really like this moisturizer
it works great as a winter moisturizer
it is my night time moisturizer
this creme is so expensive
it wasn't any better then some other moisturizers i use
it's a lightweight non oily moisturizer that works well under my makeup
s of moisturizer that are much less expensive
this cream works great
it is also a great moisturizer.
this is a wonderful moisturizer
great moisturizer for my combo skin
it is also a very good moisturizer.
i love this cream.
love love love this moisturizer!!!
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
use my regular cethapil moisturizer on the rest of my face
just use with sunblock during the day
thank goodness for this moisturizer!
nearly every moisturizer either stings my skin
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used
this moisturizer has sure cooled things down
brightens the under eye area so much so that i dont have to use as much concealer now
when i pile on the concealer
don't have to use so much concealer
it works great under an eye concealer / highlighter
on occasion i've actually forgotten to put on my under-eye concealer
i still need to apply an undereye moisturizer on top of this product
i really like this eye cream
just make sure you use a good moisturizer after use
blue herbal moisturizer for my very oily
used with the umbrian clay moisturizer my face has never looked better
the lotion are hg products for me
:) (btw it does exfoliate , so keep that in mind.
i apply this a few times a week after i exfoliate
apply to my face like it is a stick of deodorant
once you apply moisturizer
i just have to apply moisturizer afterwards
am a bit obsessed with skincare
including my waterproof mascara
i wear falsies too
moisturizer in the morning
mascara like it was nothing
it even removes my waterproof mascara.
actually it moisturize your face to a degree that you'll feel like you've just put on a thin layer of lotion
moisturizer in one step
it is perfect for when you don't wear mascara or eyeliner
this is the most mattifying moisturizer i've ever used
only downside is that combined with a heavy moisturizer
with a mattifying lotion or corrector
not so great with waterproof mascara
i will probably go back to my exfoliating facial wash once my skin can h
really just some eyeliner
can be left on like a moisturizer since it has all natural ingredients
or just use a powder on top of the moisturizer itself
it is definitely my new fave moisturizer :)
this is a thick moisturizer
this moisturizer keeps me matte all day.
as a person with oily skin moisturizers normally freak me out
you get what you pay for with face creams.
this is an ideal moisturizer for combination oily skin anf can be used for normal/dry skin if you are trying to achieve a matte texture on your skin
this cream, helps all my issues!
had tried this in comparing it with the glowstarter illuminating moisturizer
this is literally the best primer/moisturizer i have ever used
i absolutely swear by this moisturizer as a daily am moisturizer
this omg i never put on moisturizer before my foundation
yet this moisturizer does not effect its formula
this moisturizer really does exactly what it says-- moisturizers with a smooth matte finish
this moisturizer does exactly what it says.
it's thicker than most moisturizers
i've never used a matte moisturizer
this is a gorgeous moisturizer!
using my old moisturizer
i like this matte moisturizer and will buy again.
wish it had sunscreen.
some moisturizers make me look more oily
this moisturizer is amazing for my combo oily skin
i absolutely love this moisturizer i swear by it.
soft since the supercleanse moisturizer can be harsh on the face
this moisturizer is amazing!
this is the perfect daytime moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer
just a little of my bareminerals acne fighting concealer
i am a huge fan of the glam glow line so when i saw this new moisturizer
i literally slather on my moisturizer
while my face was moisturizer
not the typical "runny" moisturizer
it not only moisturizer
finally found a moisturizer that is effective
i swear my foundation is matte
i used less than typical after applying this moisturizer
the consistency is a little more solid than other moisturizers
moisturizers are my worst enemy
that's alright because i lean towards moisturizers with spf during the daytime
i would consider this moisturizer to be fairly rich
can be used as a moisturizer
by far the best full coverage face moisturizer i have ever used
honestlyi have tried 50 different moisturizers in my life
best moisturizer product i've ever used
i only wear concealer
i am obsessed with this moisturizer!
i've even used this as a moisturize for days where i just wear mascara
this is a lovely moisturizer
it lasts longer than my other moisturizers
this moisturizer does not make my face shiny at all
this moisturizer is heaven on earth for oily
this moisturizer has been absolutely perfect for my skin
used with the moisturizer
the moisturizer feels great on the skin a bit tacky
not wearing sunscreen as a teenager
i follow with murad's skin perfecting lotion
lays a great foundation for moisturizers
which by the way is an amazing moisturizer that doubles as a primer
did not apply a moisturizer after
the moisturizer combined really helped to clear my pms acne
use it as a night serum as an added boost to my moisturizer
i definitely recommend this serum for helping your skin glow
as face makeup and sunscreen.
i went from caking on make up to even it all out to only applying some bronzer
i got it as part of the birthday set with the sorbet moisturizing cream
the moisturizer for the birthday gift
i got this product along with the caudalie vinosource moisturizing sorbet for my free birthday gift from sephora yesterday
i would absolutely spend it on this in combination with the moisturizer
i got this for my birthday gift along with the vinosource sorbet moisturizer
i got a deluxe sample of this with the moisturizer
use with the moisturizer in the same line
the sorbet moisturizer goes great with this product under makeup during the day
the moisturizer for only a week
since i began using the combination of this serum with the moisturizer
i got this serum in a sample size along with the caudalie vinoperfect radiance sorbet moisturizer from sephora for my beauty insider birthday gift
alongside the sorbet moisturizer
if your an absolute skincare fanatic like me
i also use the matte moisturizer
there have been nights where i haven't felt the need to put on moisturizer after the serum
i put this on before my moisturizer
i just bought my second bottle of vinoperfect radiance serum because the results of my first bottle were fantastic
but i do love this exfoliator!
all i need is a facial oil for a moisturizer
remember to use moisturizer afterwards
i look forward to my skincare routine.
i just want a little more exfoliating
anything that has the word exfoliating i want to try
overall i think it does a much better job of exfoliating
finish up with a moisturizer
i just bought this gel
as far as eye creams go
this is my first "eye cream"
spend the money on this instead of under eye concealer
i do wish it was a tad more moisturizing
i am always trying new eye creams
i forgot to put on my under-eye concealer
i don't have to use as much concealer to cover up
i've always been a fan of clarins skincare
this is the best eye cream i have used
this eye cream is amazing!
no under eye concealer
i don't even need concealer any more.
i've tried a ton of eye creams
works very well under concealer
fine lines underneath my eyes which makes it very difficult to wear concealer
just moisturizer for my whole face
i always use under eye concealer one of my have tos even when i don't wear much make up
this cream is eye magic!
this particular eye cream is amazing.
it was a good moisturizer
i love this eye cream!
i love this eye cream!
this is excellent eye creme- the best i've used.
this is one of my first eye cream.
not only does mascara not smudge below the lower lashes
my new favorite eye cream!
i can put this on over my moisturizer-routine
moisturizers my face on the long run
it plumps up my fine lines around my eyes so my concealer looks better
i apply a pea size on top of my moisturizer
i've never been much of a moisturizer or primer user
i really love this moisturizer
i just use this moisturizer
i apply it after moisturizer
used it as a quick go-to moisturizer one day
it's a great moisturizer that doubles as a primer
sometimes i'll tap a little bronzer powder into it
i hate when you find a great moisturizer
although it seemed to moisturize while i had it on
one of which was concealer
i used this balm as a moisturizer last winter
not as a substitute for a richer winter moisturizer
i apply a super thin layer of sunblock to my face
then my eye cream
i love this moisturizer!
i believe the caudelie beauty elixir gave me acne
i will never use another moisturizer!
i find its a bit thick to use over a moisturizer.
if you like it to use it as a lotion you would have to apply that after your regular moisturizer
don't rub it in like a moisturizer.
ysl touche eclate for concealer under eye etc
clear mascara for brows
i wear this flash balm underneath my tinted bb cream or tinted moisturizer as a moisturizer/primer
by the time i looked into the mirror to apply my tinted moisturizer
i apply after my sunblock
more even when used after moisturizer
i love this cream.
i really enjoy this moisturizer.
it serves as an extra moisturizer
pat on a bit of sunscreen containing moisturizer
works well under my nars tinted moisturizer
i love using this product over my usual moisturizer or just before my tinted moisturizer
hands down my favorite moisturizer ever!
like this with some concealer under my eyes
then i immediately put on my tinted moisturizer.
i put it on over my moisturizer
before applying this balm i first apply my regular cream
i tried it under a tinted liquid bronzer
i put it on after my moisturizer
t is absolutely necessary that i moisturize after using this product
you should always moisturize anyway
if you get it in your eyes it feels like shampoo
i don't think it's ever been this soft without exfoliating first
the mattifying lotion were enough to make my skin look not just clearer
at night i follow it up with pores no more anti-aging mattifying lotion
i love this skincare line!
so be sure to have a good moisturizer
then follow with hope in a jar moisturizer by philosophy
i can use moisturizer or not with this
especially when combined with the pores no more anti aging mattifying lotion
i do not know if my skin looks better because of the cleanser or in combination with the moisturizer
follow up with a good light moisturizer!
this is the perfect moisturizer for anyone with combo/ oily skin
all i can say is that since i've been using this moisturizer
this moisturizer couldn't be more perfect
i simply use a different day cream with spf
it is good as night cream
its thicker than just a normal lotion
this cream is moisturizing without leaving a greasy after-feel or mid-day shine
awesome moisturizer for combination skin.
needs a little moisturizer something or other
i do not know if my skin looks better because of the cleanser or in combination with this moisturizer
a definite for night time moisturizer.
i tried wearing a tinted moisturizer with this
pm moisturizer all year long
since this has no sunscreen
this am moisturizer is great!
it mattifies-which is what i need in a moisturizer
then you probably need to be using a moisturizer
i actually use it in the morning under my tinted moisturizer
also great as a regular after-sun/body lotion.
this worked so much better than aloe
it was so much better than aloe
i am not the greatest at remembering to reapply my sunscreen
tan to last me longer
i really like this as a night time lotion for my face
this gel works much better than other drugstore after-sun gels that he's tried in the past
even when using sunscreen
this moisturizer never breaks me out or burns/irritates my skin
the sunscreen has done it's job
i am still using this gel a week later to maintain my tan
this is sooo much better than aloe after sun exposure
aren't quiiiite careful enough with your sunscreen
i love this lotion.
this is my fav after sun lotion!!
all i have to do is apply this lotion after a shower
it's an excellent after-sun cream
forgot to put spf lotion on one of my shoulders
i love this as my morning moisturizer
i typically follow-up with an application of a more emollient moisturizer
started using it as a moisturizer
i will not use aloe again.
since i don't go out without sunscreen
makes aloe look like a joke.
had a mishap with some spray sunblock on a windy day
was basically all out of the soy-multivitamin lotion i used to use
i can swap this out with my regular moisturizer too
this lotion is a life saver
it still is an incredible moisturizer
i wear sunscreen every day
i applied this cream-gel all over before bed
got this to take to cancun in case of sunburn because i hate the menthol smell of most after-sun lotions
peeling skin this is the moisturizer for you
it works like magic at keeping my skin moisturizer
literally my holy grail moisturizer.
that being said it's still a great moisturizer if you prefer the heavier creams
will never buy another moisturizer.
the moisturizer is very thick
my skin loves this cream.
it is an okay moisturizer.
this moisturizer just won't quit.
i really love this moisturizer
i love this face cream
it's almost like balm rather than a cream.
as a result it is not as easy to apply as a creamy moisturizer
it's significantly less expensive than my old moisturizer
i usually use clinique or shiseido moisturizer
finding the right moisturizer has become an obsession
bucks on very expensive creams
this is my new love for everyday skin moisturizer
it is definitely my go-to moisturizer
this moisturizer brings so much comfort to my skin
i love this cream
this is the only moisturizer that works for my extremely dry skin
i love this moisturizer!
l'occitane makes such fantastic skincare!
i love this cream.
so happy with this creme.
you need to try this moisturizer
if you feel like you've tried every moderately priced moisturizer under the sun
this is my first time using a l'occitane moisturizer
cream i have ever used
it doesn't sting like some moisturizers do
i am a huge fan of this moisturizer.
quest for the perfect moisturizer
it is everything that i wished in a moisturizer-- quick to absorb
i love this moisturizer.
cure your dry skin with this amazing moisturizer.
ever since i got into natural skincare i wanted a moisturizer that did the same thing as eg
i tried l'occitane's ultra rich face cream this winter
i love this cream!!
this cream is much better for dry skin
this moisturizer is great.
with the winter months i need to upgrade from my usual moisturizers: the super coconut moisturizer
had to try the lotion too
this lotion is truely amazing
i love this face cream
i don't have to reapply moisturizer mid-day
once i started using this moisturizer my skin has started to stop flaking
so far this has been a great moisturizer to wear over night
this moisturizer is amazing.
i like it especially i juse rosewater to put this cream on my face
could never find a moisturizer that gave enough hydration that lasted
i love this moisturizer.
i've tried a lot of different moisturizers in my lifetime
while this cream is for dry skin
this is great moisturizer for very dry
fantastic moisturizer for those of us with dry skin
i just bought this face cream
perfect moisturizer for harsh winters.
it's a good facial moisturizer for the winter.
at first i used it by itself as a nighttime moisturizer
mix with this moisturizer
i need this moisturizer since mine's almostrunning out
this is definitely my moisturizer of choice.
good moisturizer for dry skin.
this moisturizer is the only one you will need for the cold winter months
n the summertime i have to put an spf separately before this moisturizer
this was the only moisturizer that healed my skin
i decided to try this rich cream because all of my previous moisturizers for combination/oily skin did not help my cheeks
this is an extremely good moisturizer
it really isnt a good under-makeup moisturizer because it just comes off in a mess when you try to put concealer ontop of it to cover any blemishes
i hunt for this lotion
he always steals my lotion
this lotion is for guys guy !
i love putting this lotion on after a workout.
lotion on the market
this is my husbands favorite lotion!!!
this is the best lotion i've used yet.
this lotion is great for summer.
so this lotion is ideal for him
my man loves the lotion
he is very pleased with this body lotion.
my boyfriend absolutely loves this lotion because it quickly absorbs
most lotions are too girly
he's finally using lotion for his dry skin
this is the best body lotion i have used so far
i do believe that the moisturizer is helping to gently brighten my skin
i still hope to find a perfect anti-aging moisturizer that will help my skin be less oily
best of all it doesn't make me breakout like every other moisturizer under the sun
i've never used a night moisturizer because i've always had naturally oily skin
this is a super expensive moisturizer
in the am i use the pomergranite moisturizer
use a little moisturizer from the other murad lines
this night cream is perfect!!!
i like that in a night moisturizer
follow with this moisturizer at night
this moisturizer takes care of all of the above
this was the best night moisturizer i have used in a long time
i do like this lotion alot
i absolutely love this moisturizer

i needed a good anti-aging moisturizer.
this moisturizer works very well for night

i love this cream!
this is the best daily moisturizer.
i've tried a lot of the top moisturizers
very similar to the day moisturizer
i've tried many night time moisturizers
i love this moisturizer during the winter.
this is a great lightweight moisturizer.
the moisturizer is the first i have found that contains sunscreen
this is a suitable daytime sunscreen.
a sunscreen for my face
i feel good knowing that this moisturizer has spf
i keep the moisturizer as part of my daily routine
i think im going to switch my day moisturizer
that's the one thing i hate about most moisturizers with spf
i used this as touch up coverage in addition to my regular sunscreen
this is my favorite day time moisturizer for summer time
i used this moisturizer at night
it is a rare moisturizer for me--it has spf 30 without being oily
like most sunscreens do
this is my every day moisturizer.
lucky this moisturizer doesn't do that
please note: i don't usually wear it under foundation or concealer
best of all it doesn't make me breakout like every other moisturizer under the sun
this is the best non-greasy sunscreen moisturizer i have found so far
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
it doesn't smell like sunscreen at all
shiny the way that regular sunscreen does
hope you like this moisturizer as much as i do!
a sunscreen is needed after use.
it's a good non-greasy summer moisturizer
this is an amazing moisturizer/sun screen.
i am still trying to find my favorite sunscreen
my skin looks much "dewier" from the moisturizer
i love this sunscreen/ moisturizer.
i prefer this over the neutrogena moisturizer i've used for years
not super heavy sunscreen
my esthetician has been bugging me for years to use a daily moisturizer with spf
even with built in sunblock
the main reason that i love this moisturizer is that it has a really great spf
i love this cream.
this is the best lightweight face lotion.
i loved this daytime moisturizer
this moisturizer does it's job
best moisturizer for the money
this does not look too white on my face like a lot of other sunscreen moisturizers
i really like this moisturizer !!
i love this product as it is a good combo moisturizer
the essential c moisturizer is wonderful even though the sunscreen occassionally burns my eyes if the products gets to close
this moisturizer/sunscreen combo smells
it's the only moisturizer with sunscreen that i will use
this does not make me even oilier like a lot of sunscreens do
great light moisturizer for everyday use.
i've tried tons of spf moisturizers as acne is a big problem for me
with this moisturizer i don't feel greasy by the end of the day
i would say that it doesn't keep my complexion as matte as other moisturizers
i highly recommend it as a daily sunscreen
pretty good day moisturizer .
that usually happens with spf infused moisturizer
this is a great everyday moisturizer with spf!
this moisturizer is light-weight & smells great.
the day moisturizer is my favorite
it still smells like sunscreen
this is the best day moisturizer i have ever used
this is a lovely, light lotion for my oily skin.
it's a perfect daily moisturizer for me--penetrates quickly
i love this product for when i need a heavier moisturizer
a nice change from sunscreen smell
this product provided great sunscreen
it doesn't smell like typical sunscreen
my skin has loved murad's essential-c day moisturizer
i won't wear a day moisturizer without spf
so this moisturizer is perfect
this has got to be the best-smelling moisturizer of all time
because i wear powder foundation
just dab a little bit on top of this spf lotion
this moisturizer is light
fragrance free every day moisturizer
i also love that it has sunscreen.
wear every-day face lotion -- with spf
am always nervous about trying a new moisturizer
it's the only moisturizer i use now!
great moisturizer, skin tone seems more even
best moisturizer i have ever used.
this is a really great moisturizer
doesn't smell like the usual sunscreen
does double duty as moisturizer
this could be a good daily sunscreen for their face
if you need a sunscreen
need an intense moisturizer
i love that it is a moisturizer
sunscreen in one product
in the winter it is my go-to moisturizer
this is a lightweight moisturizer with the added bonus of spf 30 protection
best high spf lotion out there.
i'll pay the price for a sunscreen that allows my face to remain matte yet moisturized
this is a nice light moisturizer that will not leave you greasy
i love this moisturizer!
this is a great day moisturizer!
because now i have found the ultimate moisturizer/sunscreen that has solved my problems within the last week
when paired with the essential c moisturizer
moisturizer is the best i've ever used
not have to immediately put on a serum or moisturizer because it does not dry
peeling cheeks/nose/chin i began using this cleanser with the nighttime essential c moisturizer
it always feels refreshed even before i use a moisturizer
this is an amazing day moisturizer
the moisturizer made a difference right away.
before this moisturizer he was using basic skin cream
was given a sample of this moisturizer
he's been on a search for a lightweight moisturizer
in the summer i switch this out with the antony moisturizer with spf
s down this is the best mens moisturizer on the market
a moisturizer is still recommended
this moisturizer is excellent.
i hate greasy lotion.
not only does this moisturizer help with the march of time
i got this for my boyfriend who is a facial moisturizer newbie
i am now trying other moisturizers.
i love this night cream
this cream is a problem
i needed a moisturizer for everyday use
i can now wear a lighter concealer if any at all!
this moisturizer is an amazing one!
this moisturizer is a bit thicker than what i am used to
philosophy's moisturizer is more of a serumy type moisturizer than a lotion
other moisturizers make my sensitive skin break-out
doesn't leave a greasy film like some wrinkle creams can
before using this moisturizer
this is the best facial cream i've tried.
this seems to be a very good moisturizer for dry
i am very pleased with it as a moisturizer
seems to be a good moisturizer.
just as a moisturizer for my super sensitive super dry skin
i decided to try this moisturizer because i am seeing more fine lines
am still cautious about suing moisturizers
for the price it is a very good moisturizer for aging skin

considering what most moisturizers out there cost
i absolutely love this facial cream.

it is not your 100 dollar eye cream
this is the best eye cream that i've ever used.
concealer goes on smoothly
i got this to add to my aging skin care regimen
heavy like a lot of under eye moisturizers i have tried
this eye cream has more of a balm consistency
doesn't interfere with my concealer
this is the only cream that
non- greasy so your eyeshadow
this is my favorite eye cream!
definitely the best eye balm/cream i've used
it preps the eye area beautifully for concealer!
now looking back i think it was so moisturizing that my eyeliner
maybe use a gel during the day when i finish the gels i have now
this is a great moisturizer

as eye creams go though
your concealer will go on smooth
all i can say is that this product does moisturize nicely
it is a little thicker than most eye creams i have used
i really like it as an under eye moisturizer
i used this eye cream
my concealer never creases anymore

this eye cream is the bomb
it is hard to find an eye treatment cream.

i alternate with shiseido benefiance wrinkleresist24 which is fabulous for moisturizing with no aggravation of sensitive eyes

the directions on it say to follow with a moisturizer after applying

when the go to sleep i slather this one
this is definitely part of my weekly skincare routine
this moisturizer is amazing!!!

i find it "plumping
i love this cream.
this is the best night-time moisturizer i have ever found
this is the best creme i have ever used
doesn't disrupt my concealer application
this is my favorite intense moisturizer/age cream
i love this cream.
i always tend to forget to apply my moisturizer
usually my concealer sinks right into my lines within an hour
my concealer looked better than it has in years!
this eye cream is great for 2 things: as an eye cream
it's consistency is perfect for adding a little concealer or foundation to to create the perfect finishing concealer to your under eye area
eye creams naturally travel
night time moisturizers i'm going to make the change
i love this eye cream.
i liked this eye cream
my mascara doesn't run when i use it

after having a terrible experience with another high-end moisturizer

so finding a moisturizer is incredibly difficult for me
this product is a miracle cream.

i read lots of reviews before i decided to buy this moisturizer

it's one of the most effective eye moisturizers i've found
it is time for clinique to bring back the facial cream of this line
i've had horrible luck trying to find eye creams to use before makeup that aren't greasy that wind up smearing my mascara
ecay eyeshadow primer potion or similar
it's a very lightweight lotion that doesn't feel heavy
allows easy application of a concealer
makes my concealer go on flawlessly
this is the best eye lift cream i've ever used
the best eye cream there is.
use in am underneath concealers.
this cream is perfect for it

this is a great eye cream.
doesn't leave a greasy feeling under makeup or eye concealer
bought this product along with a moisturizer for my man
should be paired with a good moisturizer
perfect because of this scruffing lotion
they call it scruffing lotion
i follow up with the clinique moisture surge moisturizer
leaving skin soft and ready for moisturizer.
i follow-up using it with clinique moisturizer
i follow up with sephora brand moisturizer.
if i apply moisturizer after using this
this one works to even clean off my mascara
i normally follow this up with moisturizer
i started with the dramatically different moisturizer
i like to pair it with clinique's clarifying lotion 2
it powers through my mascara
so apply a moisturizer asap
definitely need a moisturizer after using this.
no problem if i use a moisturizer after
sunscreen is hard to get off your face
if your face is a bit dry just moisturize.
the formula is "gel like"
this product really takes off your sunscreen
including all of my mascara
since i wear a lot of waterproof eyeliner
since i was already a fan of the clinique gel moisturizer i thought that i would give this a shot
have actually found that when applying concealer over it
highly recommend this product along with the moisturizer
this is my favorite eye cream
i think concealer or foundation would blend well on top of it
my new favorite eye cream
i usually layer concealer on top
or creases my concealer
you're ready to put on your eyeshadow
this is the best eye cream i've used.
this is my favorite daytime eye cream
it is also my favorite eye cream
this cream is lightweight
constantly have to use concealer to hide it
after using this cream sometimes i don't even feel the need to put on concealer
when i wear this under concealer it doesn't crease even after many hours
makes a smooth canvas for concealer
i noticed my concealer wasn't sitting as nicely as it had when i had used this
it's a fine everyday cream
it usually messes up my concealer
i like gels more than creams for my eyes.
this is a gel-like cream.
this is what i wear everyday before my concealer
this works amazingly well under concealer
i love this eye cream.
i don't believe any eye cream is a miracle in a bottle
perfect texture to apply under eye concealer.

i am pretty sure that this is the exact same gel cream in the rollerball
this cream is light
i really like this eye cream.
smoothing- which is perfect to put concealer over
i also noticed that my concealer goes on smoother
it's one of the best eye creams i've tried
it provides a good base for my concealer.
i love clinique moisturizers to begin with.
i've used a lot of eye creams
i decided to get an under eye cream that would moisturize as well as help my dark circles
doesn't crease under concealer
it doesn't make my concealer crease when i put makeup on top of it
make a good base for under eye concealer
my boyfriend uses this lotion
it does work a bit like a primer for my undereye concealer
this is my first eye cream product.
could massage this cream around my eyes
helps your concealer stay on longer
it helped keep my concealer in place
the lines a lot less noticeable without even using concealer
i really like this eye cream
i love this eye cream.
ts good for an undereye primer before you put your concealer on
it is not a rich cream
best under eye cream!!
this is simply the best under eye moisturizer.
has been wanting a moisturizing sunscreen for months now
always comes back to this lotion
it dothat have the spf lotion smell
regular sunblock anywhere on his body is irritating to his skin
it was the only moisturizer at this price point
this moisturizer is great!
never used to take time to moisturize
so he needed a moisturizer
it definitely works better as a pre-shave / shaving lotion than an aftershave
because he won't buy or apply sunblock
gives him sunblock protection as well
love this moisturizer/spfno smellblends easilyperfect for the athlete
he has tried every men's moisturizer out there
the moisturizer doesn't make his face break out

this is the only moisturizer i can get my husb
sometimes you don't want a sunscreen in your moisturizer
great moisturizer, and awesome value for money!

he especially likes the gel-lotion.
this lotion is totally worth it.
the best thing is clinique products are unscented-no guy wants to smell like lotion all day
i love this moisturizer, it is the best!
more of a white lotion color
is the perfect year-round moisturizer
this is the only facial hydrator/moisturizer my boyfriend uses
this moisturizer is made for people with dry skin
i highly recommend this moisturizer for men with all skin types
i placed this moisturizer on my face this morning
i love the moisturizer
this moisturizer is great for everyday wear under foundation
this moisturizer is amazing
she says that this moisturizer goes a long way
sits well with my skincare
i really like the gel formula
it's just the right amount of moisturizer to go under my makeup
i didn't have any problems with this moisturizer!
i love the formula for my dry skin
this moisturizer works like a dream
all purpose face moisturizer
i love this moisturizer to use before makeup application
i love the gel version instead of the lotion
as the lotion can leave an oily feeling
this moisturizer is what i am currently using in the am
best moisturizer for oily skin!
i really enjoy this moisturizer as it feels light
i don't like moisturizers that feel heavy
love this as my everyday go to moisturizer!
either many of my moisturizers have too much oil
this moisturizer has helped improve my texture like it says it would
i love this moisturizer!
this is the best moisturizer for oily skin
i googled "best moisturizer for oily skin"
i didn't need moisturizer
i switched to this as my spring/summer moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer i've tried that works for my skin
this lotion takes care of both areas
have to buy facial sunscreen separately
i came from drugstore moisturizer to high end
most beauty gurus or workers at sephora always tells me that i need to moisturize before applying makeup or just on a daily basis so your skin will hydrate
this moisturizer does the job for it!!
its such an amazing moisturizer under your makeup
my new favorite moisturizer.
this gel moisturizer is great
this stuff is the best moisturizer
i've solved this by using a lightweight serum before i apply the moisturizer
it has no harsh fragrances which is good for my sensitive skin lol recommend this for a day moisturizer
i began to try other moisturizers
this moisturizer is perfect
decided to give this a try this time instead of the lotion
i recently switch from the first aid beauty ultra hydration moisturizer to this one
this moisturizer is awesome to thin out thick foundations
as an actual moisturizer
this moisturizer has found a permanent place in my routine
its the only face lotion that does not break my skin out
this is the best daytime moisturizer i've used for my oily skin
best moisturizer for oily skin.
this is the best moisturizer ever
this moisturizer has changed my face.
seriously all makeup looks perfect over this moisturizer
i've had a time trying to find that perfect moisturizer
this moisturizer will be perfect for you
this is a very thin lotion
i prefer the gel form instead of the lotion
i used this as first as my usual moisturizer.
i started using it as my morning moisturizer
although i like this moisturizer a lot
i want to try a moisturizer for dry skin
this moisturizer has simplified my makeup application so much
it's the first department store moisturizer i have actually liked
this moisturizer has become my holy grail
this is the first moisturizer i ever tried because i never knew that moisturizing
so thrilled to finally have found a good moisturizer for oily skin
i never thought i'd rave like this over a moisturizer
this is great as a moisturizer.
i do like this moisturizer.
you gott use a bit more to moisturize it
this gel moisturizer is perfect
it's a perfect gel moisturizer for combination
the gel formula is light weight
this moisturizer is great for everyday use!
this is really the best day time moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
this lotion is a great consistency
the only complaint i have is that i wish it was a tad more moisturizing
get a cream moisturizer for the winter
it won't make your face moisturized enough as this is gel formula
it is lotion formula
so you can switch to the lotion formula when the winter is coming
their moisturizers have to be some of the best around
goes on easier than the lotion
i really like this moisturizer.
i just make sure to use a heavier moisturizer at night
if i don't use the right cleanser/moisturizer it will flake
if you've got dry skin try a very thin layer as a moisturizer
i apply my daily moisturizer at day
i prefer to use it after a deep exfoliation with something like kate somerville exfollikate
of course you still have to use a moisturizer
everything i use for my skincare besides this is like 10 dollars
i know it's because of my daily regimen wearing this sunscreen
it's a light weight lotion
love this sunscreen lotion!
it is a perfect combination of sunscreen
i love this lotion.
exactly like a normal moisturizer
to me this is a basic moisturizer that gets the job done
overall it's a good moisturizer
you can buy their eye cream or night cream with it
this is my all time favorite moisturizer.
i love this product except that moisturizing lotions from lancôme usually works well with my combination/oily skin except this one goes on a bit heavy
i just started using a daily sunscreen besides makeup- better late than never
i wanted a thick moisturizer with spf in a pump bottle
does not give a white residue like some sunscreen lotions do
i received the cream version of this moisturizer as a free sample
its been over one year that i have been searching for a light weight moisturizer with spf for my sensitive combination skin
this is absolutely the perfect daily moisturizer.
i love this sunscreen moisturizer.
ts been hard 4 me to find a good sunscreen/lotion
it does not leave ur skin white like most sunscreens :

this is an excellent fall/winter/spring sunscreen
does not smell like sunscreen
i am not exaggerating when i say this day lotion is miraculous
this lotion does exactly what it promises
i love this moisturizer

but overall a great lotion with spf.
my skin can be very sensitive to sunscreens
this is a great lotion for everyday use that can withst
this moisturizer also acts as a really nice primer for mineral foundations
i really like this moisturizer!
this lotion doesn't quite cut it
when i moved i felt that i needed a moisturizer that had a higher spf
this product does not have that funny sunscreen scent
this moisturizer works great for normal skin in a dry climate
needed a daily moisturizer with a high-spf sunscreen
daily sunscreen/moisturizer for several weeks now
this sunscren/moisturizer will now be a daily staple for me
while this product does smell like sunscreen immediately after it is applied
i love this lotion.
s of face moisturizers over the years
of all the lotions with spf in them this one seems to be the lightest
add in the higher spf than most of lancome's other moisturizers
this moisturizer doesn't leave a thick
this is the best moisturizer that i have found to lighten my dark spots
then i found this moisturizer

i enjoy this moisturizer quite a bit
it is a really light moisturizer
it's a really good moisturizer
i got this moisturizer for my boyfriend
he used to hate the idea of using a moisturizer
my husband loves using this moisturizer.
i aked him to try this moisturizer
nice lotion, not too heavy.
he loves high-end moisturizers
i love this face cream!
lipstick plus it lasts you forever
great with taking off mascara.
it melts all my makeup even my waterproof mascara
it's also great at removing waterproof mascara
i am very picky when it comes to skincare
i feel like you need this in your skincare routine
it's the best thing that ever happened to my skincare routine
even gets the super tough waterproof mascara off in one try
it is really a balm
i know it's not a moisturizer
is very gentle to use for eyeliner
removes even the tough test waterproof mascara
for the waterproof mascara
when i rub the waterproof eyeliner
4 stars because i wish this was just a tad bit more moisturizing
scrub my eyes to get off stubborn mascara
i wear waterproof liquid eyeliner
gently massage over mascara
anything from waterproof mascara
i don't even have waterproof mascara residue left
my concealer doesn't crease at all since i've been using it
i wish more eye creams did.
i just love this eye cream.
i can even skip the concealer now!
i don't even need concealer when i use this product
i love this product because i can use it with my concealer without any pilling or smudging
for every pump of the cream
does it work because of the caffeine?
this moisturizer is great if you want a product that is very lightweight
i love this daytime eye cream.
this is a great everyday spf eye moisturizer that sinks in quickly
it is an excellent moisturizer
when i added this eye cream to my daily routine
which is good because i hate wearing concealer
defiantly my go to daily moisturizer.
now it's my daily eye cream
this eye cream is a miracle.
eye creams are too greasy for me
it really is a magic cream!
mascara does not melt into it like some other eye creams
i no longer need to wear concealer after i start using essential-c eye cream
eye creams are super important
this is probably my 6th "refill" of this eye cream
is not overly greasy so that concealer stays put
i love this eye cream.
this cream is nice
love that i don't need to follow up with sunblock
hadn't tried an eye moisturizer because i have such sensitive skin
murad's essential-c eye cream has some great ingredients for day wear
this is a great eye cream
i looked for a long time for a spf lotion i could put around my eyes
this eye cream has turned out to be a great daytime sun protection moisturizer that i wear under my makeup
went back to them trying to find a vitamin c face lotion
i love this cream -- i use it as my day eye cream
love this eye cream.
finally i found a eye cream with spf.
this is a nice lightweight eye cream with spf
i love that it contains sunscreen
this eye cream is a bit pricey
i love this eye cream!
this is a miracle creme for me.
this is a great day eye cream.
it is not a night cream.
i might switch to something a bit more moisturizing
my moisturizer goes on smooth
on occasion i have to use an additional moisturizer
cleans well, is not very good with mascara.
would prefer it in a gel
you just can't find affordable skincare these days
this looks like lotion and feels like lotion.
the dramatically different lotion
have paired it with the clarifying lotion
you still need to use a face exfoliator
under algenist's tinted anti-aging moisturizer with spf 30
once i apply concealer or anything it's not a good look
t pore minimizer with sunscreen
concealer all in one
stay matte all day long
make sure you moisturize before applying any primer
this product does such a great job mattifying skin
oil-free moisturizer that works for my combo
no like literally the fasting absorbing moisturizer ever
this is a no-thrills oil-free moisturizer.
my dermatologist suggested replacing my heavy moisturizer with an oil free one
if i need moisturizer
if i don't need moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
this is a great daytime moisturizer to use under makeup or for the day
this is the only moisturizer that doesn't make my forehead oily
love the texture of this moisturizer
only moisturizer that doesn't break me out.
this moisturizer helps them from happening
this is a great moisturizer.
i've had to add an additional heavier moisturizer at night
use it perhaps once a week just to help exfoliate which i find to be an important skin care regimen at my age
great moisturizer for sensitive skin!
this a great moisturizer for oily/combo skin.
this is a great lightweight moisturizer that is gentle on my sensitive skin
i've tried every moisturizer out there!
only moisturizer that doesn't cause my skin to break out
i love that this moisturizer is lightweight
i love this moisturizer.
i just cant justify almost $80/month for a moisturizer
applying this moisturizer my face looks amazing
this is the first moisturizer i have ever used that didn't break out my skin in summer
when moisturizers are my biggest problem
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
out of all the moisturizers i've used
i really like this oil-free moisturizer.
best moisturizer i've ever used.
this is an amazing moisturizer for those with oily or combo skins
this is the only moisturizer that gives me amazing moisture
i put on my physical sunblock afterwards
this lotion saved my skin
this is the best oil free moisturizer i have ever used
gentle moisturizer to go in conjunction with the alphe beta facial peel pads
it's a pretty decent moisturizer
this moisturizer really helps relieve
was hoping this would be a great balancing moisturizer
i always use a light lotion like this to my entire face
try not to go with a moisturizer that is too heavy
i like this moisturizer
not my perfect moisturizer
purchasing a number of moisturizers last spring i l
this moisturizer is lightweight
moisturized without that greasy feeling that a lot of moisturizers leave behind
moisturizer is light and does not feel greasy
very light weight feeling moisturizer
this is not an oily moisturizer at all.
this moisturizer is fantastic.
it is more than i wanted to spend on a moisturizer
by far one of the best moisturizers i have ever used
this is a great moisturizer.
this lightweight lotion does the trick
this is my favorite moisturizer on the market.
the moisturizer is really light
this is the best moisturizer that i have ever tried
my previous review was intended for the moisturizer
have always had trouble finding a moisturizer that will moisturize without adding to my shine
this lotion is fantastic
it's my favorite moisturizer
not so emollient it breaks me out
a recent breakout from a new moisturizer
it does take off most regular mascaras
using this serum is my favorite part of my skincare routine
i also use it with the wild rose moisturizer
at night i use the black pine moisturizer
the day cream of this line
i apply a moisturizer or night cream
i don't always even use this with any moisturizer
night- i use it under moisturizer at night
i follow with a moisturizer and then a face oil.
helps to extend the efficacy of my moisturizer as well
brightening cream in the day
allows me to put on my eye concealer without any dryness
it doesn't matter because i put on moisturizer after
this eye cream is the best one i've ever used.
it doesn't give you the benefits of other stronger serums like dior
use the brightening moisturizer for my face at night
gives that base suppleness before putting on the moisturizer
before my moisturizer in winter
a lighter moisturizer with sunscreen in warmer months
i tried the korres wild rose 24 hour moisturizer
my moisturizer isn't quite cutting it
when i used the moisturizer alone, it was nice.
when i put this under the moisturizer, wow!
i decided to try it as a daycream to wear under my sunblock
usually without moisturizer my skin feels tight
i don't even need to use a daily moisturizer anymore
mostly i wear it under my daily moisturizer
i am using this for a moisturizer
around your eyes, as a moisturizer, and a serum.
in the morning i use this w/ a sunscreen
at night i use this with an additional moisturizer
my boyfriend also likes it as a moisturizer
then i use a moisturizer
i alternate this serum nightly under my usual moisturizer
with the rose moisturizer every other night
since i started using the moisturizer
i always wanted to meet one perfect anti-aging eye cream
i always use the rose moisturizer
i often have to add a mattifying lotion
which i've been using for years as a light moisturizer
need an additional moisturizer on top
since i can't use heavy cream
can't be without this daily moisturizer
it doesn't contain sunscreen
i love that this has sunscreen
seems like the spf coverage is a trade off for the intense moisture of a product without sunscreen
perfect moisturizer for oily-prone skin.
i love this moisturizer
so daytime moisturizer with spf is nonnegotiable
finally a spf moisturizer that works amazing for me
i love this moisturizer
there is no heavy "sunscreen" feel
i keep repurchasing this one because it is exactly what i need in my everyday daytime moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer that works perfectly with my skin
would like to have a moisturizer that prevents wrinkles
i will say it's a wonderful moisturizer
it was either this moisturizer or the origins with the spf
not very sunscreen-ish
it is not oily like most sunscreens
i tried almost all spf lotions at sephora
it was the best moisturizer i've ever used.
forgot how much i love their moisturizer
she said that it is very important that daily creams have at least spf of 25
this is my go to moisturizer!!
i really enjoyed using this moisturizer every day under my makeup
i am currently looking around to see if i can find a face cream with similar sunscreen ingredients at a cheaper price
this day cream is very rich
i find this is a great moisturizer
it doesn't have that white-ish pigment that other sunscreens have
lancôme has always been my go-to moisturizer.
has great sunscreen protection
it is the best moisturizer i have ever used.
also provides sunscreen protection
i need to wear sunscreen every day
i am on my second bottle of this moisturizer
for now it's a lovely fall/winter moisturizer
may be because i apply prescription skin creams
this is a wonderful moisturizer
i am so in love with this moisturizer.
s of moisturizer over the years

light moisturizing day cream with sunscreen that i use for several years already
love lancome lotion, great product.
this is now my regular go to everyday facial cream

i apply under lotion.
i don't even need a moisturizer with this under my makeup
i do apply lotion over
this is the best acne cream i have ever used.

day cream as a gift
it will moisturize but will not your skin shiny.
i love this moisturizer !!!!!!
even dry skins that need a lighter lotion for summer will revel in this product's capabilities
when i desire my spf already inside my moisturizer
doesn't feel like a sunscreen!
so far i find the moisturizer going on smooth
this is the moisturizer for you
this is a great light-weight moisturizer that works great with my normal/slightly oily skin
the spf is another wonderful addition to this already amazing lotion

i think this is more of a moisturizer than anything
the cream is definitely pricey
i really hate the smell of sunscreen

i absolutely loved this moisturizer because i didn't need to mix rose water with it

i really like this moisturizer.
this is a nice moisturizer
this lotion should be every girls best friend.

it does a decent job as a basic moisturizer for the price
feels lighter than the shiseido bioperformance moisturizer
lightweight for a night cream.
oily night creams so this was perfect for what i wanted
an almost perfect cream

recommendation: definitely apply moisturizer before this
if you put moisturizer on first
the day moisturizer for anti-wrinkle/preventative purposes
i'll squirt some moisturizer on my h

i am even considering switching my moisturizer to this br
always my favorite eye cream
i find that this is only eye creme that helps.
i find that this eye cream is very plumping
i realized i was getting a little wrinkle under my eyes from rub-applying concealer
it always helps my under eye concealer look smooth
if i ever wear concealer without this eye cream under
i tried my usual eye creams, and no relief.
i've only ever used this eye cream.
this is a great night cream
i love this eye cream.
i recently found out that the sheets take off my super waterproof mascara very well
creams you undoubtedly have in your pm regimen
bottom eyeliner not so much
they don't remove waterproof mascara-my only complaint
works on even heavy mascara
grabbed this moisturizer as well
it dosent moisturize my face the whole day
this moisturizer goes on light
the rep recommended this moisturizer to help with it i only tried this one time so far
this moisturizer was meant for me.
murad matifying lotion seems to do a better job
it is the best matifying moisturizer that i have ever used
this does the job of both a moisturizer
this moisturizer is great under makeup
this moisturizer does help moisturize my dry spots enough for under makeup
i will never replace it with another moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer.
years of searching a matifying moisturizer for my intensely oily skin i have finally found it
once your skin absorbs the moisturizer
i really love how the moisturizer makes my skin feel
so little moisturizer comes out with each pump
this is a great moisturizer that truly has a mattifying effect
this moisturizer is awesome for my oily skin
it doesn't make my face feel tight like other mattifying moisturizer
best non-spf moisturizer.
i love how this moisturizer is lightweight.
thanks to the pureness moisturizer
buying the pureness quick start to oil-control kit instead of buying this moisturizer as a st
the kit costs the same as this moisturizer alone
the moisturizer in the kit is only 0
the fact that this moisturizer doesn't have any
even bb creams would work
after using the shiseido pureness matifying moisturizer for only a week now
strongly recommend this moisturizer for anyone with oily skin
it beat my love obsession for kiehl's gel cream for oily skin types
this moisturizer is suitable for combination type skin
this face lotion is a winner for a matifying lotion
ready for sunscreen : i recommend ole henricksen for oily-combination skin its pure magic all together
to come back to this moisturizer
this moisturizer is a must have for oily skin!
the lotion goes on light
this is a great test moisturizer for someone who hasn't worn moisturizer in the past
this moisturizer works great for my oily skin because it doesn't leave residue or shine
this moisturizer is the holy grail for me.
my routine is to use this moisturizer first
at some point i've tried almost every moisturizer on the market
will recommend it to anyone who is on a lookout for an oil-free moisturizer
this is my favorite moisturizer!
this lotion is very light-weighted
love how this moisturizer feels lightweight
this moisturizer is by no means matifying.
i think what they meant is that this lotion dries matte
this moisturizer is light-weight
i love this moisturizer.
even a moisturizer will not help this cycle.
then follow with this mattifying moisturizer
this moisturizer is great
i love this moisturizer.
did not break me out as most moisturizers do.
had the biggest problem of moisturizers that make you sweaty
having a hg moisturizer that doesn't make me any oilier is key
this moisturizer is the best.
this will be my staple for now on i will only use this moisturizer
this moisturizer is really easy to apply
it is a lightweight moisturizer
first moisturizer i've ever used
finish for this moisturizer
this moisturizer does a great job at matifying my face
am no longer using this as a moisturizer
after this moisturizer it wont be my last
i love this lotion!
i love this moisturizer.
i hate the way other moisturizers make my skin shiny
this is the most lightweight moisturizer
i also felt like i needed to use another moisturizer in addition to this product
this is the most lightweight moisturizer i've ever used
i absolutely love this matte moisturizer.
i am obsessed with this moisturizer.
it is an amazing mattifying moisturizer.
i will only use this moisturizer from now on.
i mix it with tinted moisturizer
i am absolutely obsessed with this moisturizer.
this is the only moisturizer that has helped keep shine to a minimum while keeping my skin soft
i don't like any creamy moisturizer or face cream
the opposite i like very watery moisturizer.
i think this moisturizer combined with the powder is a winning combo
a lot of moisturizers make my face break out.
this is a fabulous moisturizer!
other moisturizers might break me out
a nice light gel-cream for the summer
soft when this moisturizer in the summer
got the pureness mattifying moisturizer oil-free since i prefer a matte finish
i've searched for a moisturizer that doesn't cause break-outs
i really like this gel moisturizer.
my skin feels so soft after applying this lotion
it only provide moisturizer
i like to wear a light weight gel moisturizer because i don't like the feeling of having to blot before 12pm
i like this moisturizer because it is very light weight
was about to purchase clinique's gel moisturizer when i saw this
now i am using this gel-cream after applying vichy
am always on the lookout for a good moisturizer that won't cost me an arm
its definitely more gel than lotion
it is a cream, but in gel form.
this is the best moisturizer i've used yet.
it is officially my holy grail moisturizer.
perfect for am before applying sunscreen.
it's one of the best moisturizer i've ever used.
gel-cream is better for winter
i opted for the gel-cream version of the moisturizer because of winter
i love this moisturizer!
the gel-cream goes on smooth
so this moisturizer is lightweight
this cream works great
since i like to go on the lighter side of moisturizers for the daytime
my friend kept trying to make me use different moisturizers
if only shiseido would add even spf 15 to this lotion
i really like this gel moisterizer.
i decided to give the pureness gel-creme a try
with combination skin that's prone to break outs this moisturizer is amazing
i especially like that this product is a gel cream
i tried many different moisturizer for many years
light but a good moisturizer.
after doing my research to find the best moisturizer for my skin
i think this moisturizer is awesome!
this is the perfect moisturizer for the hot
this moisturizer is thin
i love how this moisturizer goes on
the pureness gel-cream is the lightest moisturizer i've ever used
i'd definitely recommend it for skin that breaks out to most moisturizers
this shiseido cream is so light
my son has used this very very light moisturizer thru acne
i really like this moisturizer.
is lighter than a cream
this moisturizer is light-weight
my skin lets me know when i'm using the wrong moisturizer
this is the perfect moisturizer for me.
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used.
this can cause my makeup to get cakey
clinique turnaround serum or shiseido serums all worked great underneath of this nice luxurious cream
it's a moisturizer i know
i should actually use a heavier moisturizer
even less for daytime under sunscreen
this cream is so over the top moisturizing i can only use it once or twice a week tops
someone commented that this is the perfect winter lotion
this cream is amazing!
s down one of the best moisturizers i have ever used
i love the texture of this rich moisturizer.
it was an amazing moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer!
i love this cream.
i love this moisturizer from shiseido.
it's the best moisturizer out there
this cream is the best.
because it was the only moisturizer able to keep my skin from looking like a crocodile's
i think this is probably the best moisturizer i've ever tried
one of my favorite face creams.
this is the best face cream i've ever used!
this is what a good moisturizer should be.
i don't have to use much to moisturize my whole face
the cream is expensive
asked for a nice face cream
this amazing cream leaves my skin
fabulous moisturizer, that makes my skin glow.
i highly recommend this cream for dry
this cream is great.
i switched to this moisturizer after using benefiance day emulsion for the last 6 years
love this face lotion
this is the best moisturizer h
have had a hard time finding the perfect moisturizer
i love this cream!
i love to dab it around my eyes as it is very moisturizing
could still use this face creme
your mascara will come off
with my regular moisturizers
i tried to look for a moisturizer for years that wouldn't dry my skin
this is an incredible moisturizer.
this cream is heavy
i deff recommend this moisturizer to anyone with problem prone skin
i absolutely love this moisturizer
rich moisturizer without being heavy
the white lucent lotion was not moisturized enough for me
this cream is very light
just apply under-eye concealer
this cream is expensive
that's why i love the sheseido line especially the sunscreen products
use heavy duty moisturizers i haven't had that problem
with the exception of waterproof liquid eyeliner
that can be countered with a good moisturizer
i make sure to moisturize right after i use it.
after applying my moisturizer my skin was fine
i follow up with an intensive moisturizer which helps
i love shiseido for skincare
i love this cream.
i switched to just using it at night with my heavier night moisturizing cream
use it with the toner and sunscreen.
use toner or moisturizer.
use it with moisturizer
consider this as well: i use heavy mascara
while i used a lot of sunscreen
it lifts mascara completely
greasy in my skin like most moisturizers with spf
my lotion had disappeared
absolutely love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is the best i've seen in a while
it is a thinner moisturizer
it is basically a day moisturizer
i love this lotion!
this moisturizer goes on light and smooth.
this moisturizer is perfect for combination skin type people
i tried this lotion as i felt like i needed a change
it is a great lightweight moisturizer with an spf included
i love this moisturizer so much
unlike every other everyday moisturizer i've tried
it's everything i wanted in an everyday moisturizer
after trying a million different moisturizers
this is my moisturizer for spring and summer.
wanted a light moisturizer with sunscreen
this moisturizer does not disappoint.
this emulsion is perfect in the morning with some spf protection
it's better than clarins bright lotion
i like how light the lotion is considering it has spf
bought this one since i am out of moisturizer
it feels like sunblock lotion that you apply on top of your moisturizer
i love the feel of this lotion
i always use a serum before the moisturizer
the day moisturizer is ok.
a good product with a spf as a daily moisturizer though
i just got the lotion yesterday
this is my absoulte fave moisturizer to use after washing my face
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used!!!
some moisturizers tend to be cakey under makeup
this is by far one of the best moisturizers i have used
i really like this moisturizer!
i normally use the white lucent lotion
i think this is better than the lotion.
this cream is amazing.
this was a good moisturizer
this is one of the best moisturizers that i've used
like a moisturizer with spf that i can use every morning
provides a good base for a tinted moisturizer
not if you need an intensive moisturizer
as it is a heavy cream
great fall and winter cream.
not cream blush but eyeliner & mascara.
i like a heavy day cream to avoid reapplying moisturizer to my dry spots throughout the day
this cream is light
it is the perfect day cream!
the cream is not causing breakout or anything bad like other cream moisturizers
i love this face cream.
i really like this cream.
one of the best creams that has suited my skin
i love this moisturizer.
apply a bit of this cream
of course, i put sunscreen over it.
this moisturizer make your skin really soft ok for night use
except the spf 16 lotion
the texture of this moisturizer is light
i am pretty happy with the white lucent moisturizer
it's best cream for winter.
firming serum then this white lucent cream at night without anything else since the cream alone is heavy
i am very picky when it comes to moisturizer
this moisturizer is thick
no need for concealer
i just find that when it comes to skincare
the boscia eye balm doesn't work
i prefer clinique creams
the more expensive eye cream
has layered great for me with concealer
like i said, its miracle cream.
concealer only really catches right after application
i love this eye cream.
this is my go-to eye cream.
i could still wear under concealer
this eye cream is perfect for day use.
this is the cream for you
this is one of the best eye creams that i have used
dries quickly and concealer looks great over top.
i've tried a few different moisturizers
have had to use multiple concealers to cover them
it is not a miracle cream
my underage concealer goes on smooth with no creases like with some other eye creams/gels i have tried
i love this eye cream!
i really bought this cream for the hydration anyways
this does help my concealer blend in better
still i would purchase again because of how moisturizing the cream is
best eye cream for the price.
this is my first ever eye cream
it helps with caking of concealer which is great too
i do find it is just a really good moisturizing eye cream
this moisturizer allows me to be proactive
makes a great base for concealer or eye makeup
this is my eye cream.
i highly recommend this product for anyone who needs a great eye moisturizer
this cream is excellent.
i probably need another kind of moisturizer that clinique might provide
also, apply your face cream before eye cream!
i get crappie looking concealer
i love this eye cream
it's almost like a balm more than a cream
what a great eye cream.
i often forget to put my moisturizer on
then applied my moisturizer
this gel actually removes all makeup except waterproof mascara--it does fine with waterproof liner
i don't need to wash again or apply moisturizer since it leaves skin balanced
this moisturizer was recommended to me by a sephora employee
which i love because i don`t want to use night creams
slap moisturizer on my face
following up with vichy moisturizer
have since started using ren's evercalm face lotion that i also love
typically i just use a tinted moisturizer or cc cream
can't do typical night creams
i love this cream and now this brand!
i don't have to run after a heavy moisturizer after using it
this is sunscreen and she is in heaven.
has a very lotion like quality
first time i use an eye cream/gel.
this gel is for you
i would not recommend this is your primary moisturizer
use with a concealer to mask all dark circles.
the best eye gel i've used.
the gel is easy to apply
this eye gel is my new best friend!!
i also like that it is a gel
i really enjoy using this eye cream
i really like this eye gel
some night moisturizers are really heavy
this night cream works.
i love this night cream.
i don't like the way most night creams feel.
you would like this cream
i love this cream
this cream is amazing!
this is my hg night lotion.
i change up my moisturizers a few times a year.
i really love this night time moisturizer.
i love this night cream.
i love this night cream.
this night cream is rich
ive tried a lot of different moisturizers
this is the very best facial cream i've ever used
this night cream is great to apply
this is the only moisturizer that has won me over
this night cream has been a fantastic complement to the night serum
this is a fairly good moisturizer
i really enjoy this moisturizer!
beyond any moisturizer i've ever used…
dash of sunscreen to face the world?
i also tend to like my night cremes heavier
love this night cream.
i love this night moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer
even the bigger bottle of body lotion costs less.
this is probably one of the best night creams i've ever used
who says night creams have to be rich
this is packed with good vitamins for the skin
which is something i look for when shopping for skincare
i recommend this cream.
i love this cream.
this is the best moisturizer i have found.
chose this as the first moisturizer to try
will definitely keep this in my skincare routine.
i take it off with clinique clarifying lotion
i just put my moisturizer on after
i make sure to follow up with a good moisturizer
with moisturizer it's a great combination
minus the waterproof mascara
mattifying sunscreen because its oil-free
a light fragrance free moisturizer
corrected lotion for the extra moisture
corrected moisturizer for about a month
a good retinol product have almost given me a "poreless look"
the consistency is like a lotion
this product works but it goes on like a lotion.
then use the acne serum as well 2x with sunblock during the day so this is just awesome get it
i am super picky with my skincare
then apply face moisturizer over it
then my regular moisturizer
it made my moisturizer ball up
i put it on right before my moisturizer.
i absolutely love this gel although it pills when i apply moisturizer over it
right now i am using it twice a day with a moisturizer
be sure and use a moisturizer after it!
i love that i can use this with my other serums
if i just use a thin coat under my moisturizer
i will always have this in my skin care regimen.
as i rub in my moisturizer it begins peeling off
put on an spf 15 moisturizer
the moisturizer pulls at the serum
same happened with my clinique serums
i then apply a moisturizer if needed afterwards.
dosen't intrfer with my daily moisturizer
exfoliating every day was too hard on my skin
on days i really want to exfoliate i use this
a moisturizer that it doesn't try me out at all
that's usually a sign that i need to exfoliate
i quickly found that moisturizing daily is a must when using this
use a serum or a moisturizer immediately after
disappointed now that philosophy has discontinued the moisturizer
this is the best exfoliator and mini peel!
this exfoliator has done nothing to them at all
it helps my skincare to soak in to my skin better at night
it's a gengle enough exfoliator that i can use it daily
each wash is followed by hope in a jar moisturizer
i decided i needed a better exfoliating wash
i definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for a great exfoliator
it helps with the dryness since he doesn't out a moisturizer after
sometimes i just add it to my moisturizer
use this product twice a day with sunscreen
you may need an additional moisturizer
no moisturizer or other serums.
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used in life
decided to brave the day without any foundation or concealer
i decided that this stuff was a mattifying primer-
then apply moisturizer as well
this product is wonderful under your moisturizer.
helps make your moisturizers work better.
this was recommended by paula begoun as a great nighttime moisturizer that benefits skin
i love it also has a lottttt of good antioxidant ingredients so you get what you pay for
i stumbled upon this incredible lotion
*i use as a day and night moisturizer
i've gone through a lot of night moisturizers
nothing compares to this moisturizer
work horse night moisturizer that does what it says without all the bells
this is a really excellent moisturizer- the texture is great
i like this night moisturizer during the summer
this moisturizer doesn't burn when i apply it
deeply moisturizer without making my skin break out
this has got to be one of the best night moisturizers i've ever tried
it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy like other moisturizers do
it is a very nice moisturizer for normal to dry skin
this has been my night moisturizer for years.
while i like the lotion in general i was getting more
this is a great eye cream
my skin gets so dry that i use this as my regular daily moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer
it is really a lotion
this is a really good nighttime moisturizer for my combination skin
this is a lovely moisturizer.
this moisturizer has kept that tendency at bay
at least some of the credit belongs to this moisturizer
i consider this moisturizer my life saver!
i finally changed my skincare regimen
tried this product with clinique superdefense spf 25 age defense moisturizer dry combination
this is a great moisturizer.
this cream is packed with 8 differnet antioxidants that make your skin just sing with joy every morning
i also use the superdefense day cream spf 25
this lotion leaves my skin so so soft.
very nice night time moisturizer for oily or combination oily skin
this moisturizer is packed with antioxidants which might not undo damage that's already there
antioxidant boost at night just in case any sun damage gets through my sunscreen
so look to this as a great moisturizer with no irritants
i loved my first bottle of this night moisturizer
first time i've ever bought a second bottle of a moisturizer
the moisturizer would not even sink into my skin
i started using this moisturizer in the dry/combination formula while on accutane because my skin became dry
i also like the moisture surge night moisturizer.
it's my favorite night time moisturizer.
this moisturizer helps control it
my favorite moisturizer ever.
since i am now of an age where i actually need the moisturizing step --in addition to sunscreen--this is a no brainer
this is a nice night moisturizer.
this night cream is light
finally found this moisturizer
was not heavy enough of an overnight moisturizer for me
i do not feel the need to reaply moisturizer during the day
the best moisturizer ever!
this is a great overall night moisturizer that's not greasy
this lotion is the only skin care change i have made lately
the lotion makes my skin feel soft.
would recommend if you don't mind spending $40 on moisturizer
i feel that in the long run this lotion well benefit my skin
i alternate this moisturizer with a retinol product every other night
be sure to apply sunscreen over the top of it
this is a wonderful night moisturizer for my combination skin
this moisturizer has helped the "glow" reappear in my skin after a long time
so finally i found this moisturizer
good moisturizer for my winter dry skin.
it felt more like a gel creme blanket on top of my dry
clinique --- if your listening i need another creme that matches the onlines texture
this is my favorite moisturizer.
ever since i've tried a sample of this moisturizer
this is an intensive moisturizer
the combination skin / oily version of this is my nightly equivalent to my am superdefense spf 25 age defense moisturizer
this moisturizer doesn't make my skin break out
decided to get a night time moisturizer as well
i believe clinique release these two moisturizers not too long ago
has all the things you need for a nighttime moisturizer
this is an ideal moisturizer for combination skin
i need a thicker moisturizer
only moisturizer i can use.
love this face lotion
this moisturizer is no different
i like this moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer
i normally use heavy face cream at night to moisturize
i love this moisturizer
as far as i know it is a moisturizer
i put continuous rescue moisturizer first because i want the antioxidants directly on my skin
my dermatologist told me it has lots of great antioxidants
it is a fantastic moisturizer all on it's own
this is my second tube of this moisturizer.
it is like a light lotion
it was sold to me as a "serum" to use before my daily moisturizer
i don't feel that i need an extra moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer.
not an eye cream
i love this eye cream
my very favorite eye cream.
works excellent with a cream concealer
i've tried a bunch of expensive eye creams
the best eye cream i've tried
for the undereye area as this product alone was not hydrating enough under my concealer
this lotion is so great!
this is by far the best moisturizer i've ever used
i love this lightweight moisturizer
this moisturizer is nice
extreme sensitivity to every moisturizer i tried out
from day one of using the umbrian clay lotion i noticed a difference
finish my routine with this lotion
i absolutely love the umbrian clay lotion.
this honestly after years of trying every type of moisturizer
this moisturizer is wonderful for my extremely oily
i highly recommend this for those who like a moisturizer that feels very light
thankfully this cream moisturizer my skin
this is a good lightweight moisturizer that is just enough for my combination skin
since it's one of the better moisturizers i've tried
followed by ptr aha/acne clearing gel then this before makeup forever matte foundation
love the eye cream!
this moisturizer feels great on
this moisturizer is really great for controlling my oil throughout the day
i love this moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer i use during the summer
so far is the only moisturizer that solves my flaky forehead problem while also keeping me matte
i love this lotion!
daytime moisturizer has always been a problem for me because my skin is so oily
i adore this lotion.
this is my staple go-to lotion which i apply after my kiehl's calendula toner
i feel that the lotion is too lightweight to really help my skin recover
i feel it is a great moisturizer
this daily moisturizer is absolute perfection.
it is the best oil free moisturizer
this lotion definitely helps keep oil at bay.
i love this moisturizer!!!
this moisturizer is the best by far
with the umbrian clay moisturizer my skin is still shine free after twelve hours
the lotion feels good
this moisturizer is amazing
this lotion is light
i will be sticking with this moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
years of my life trying to find a great moisturizer that can h
decided to try the umbrian clay face lotion
my skin is so greasy i can't wear any moisturizer
every other moisturizer i've tried made my face a greasy mess
i would say this is definitely the go to moisturizer for extremely oily skin
you definitely need a different moisturizer for days when your skin is really dry
layer sunscreen over it
at first i didnt like this moisturizer because i was trying to wear it under my foundation
but this lotion is the best !
this oil-free lotion is the first i've ever used that is moisturizing enough for my cheeks
the lotion is great for combination skin.
this umbria clay lotion has been a godsend.
this lotion is perfect!
best moisturizer i have ever used.
just use this moisturizer
a lot of moisturizers just don't do it for me
this is a very light face lotion that i love a lot for summer
this lotion is great for my skin
i love this moisturizer!!
i love trying any new moisturizers that are geared for oily skin
went to look for a moisturizer to match for my skincare routine
this moisturizer has done wonders for my skin.
if i used moisturizer
when i started to use this moisturizer
after looking around for a moisturizer that was lightweight
the saleseperson highly recommended this product when i asked about oil-free moisturizer for my oily/combo skin
i like this moisturizer
this face lotion actually helps absorb the oil on my face after applying tinted moisturizer
this moisturizer did not make me break out at all
this moisturizer makes my skin feel great
i will never go to any other moisturizer!
this is a really great moisturizer.
i really like this lotion so far.
this is a good moisturizer

this cream is a good fit for my skin

i love all of lancome's moisturizers.
i love this night-cream.
i don't have a lot of time in the morning to apply moisturizer
moisturizer once per day
i love the clinique dramatically different gel moisturizer
for anyone use a moisturizer with this product
i wanted to try a moisturizer to help with dryness
i still used my routine lotion after application
this cleanser tends to already dry out the skin so make sure you moisturize
so a good moisturizer is necessary
now after using this alot with the lotion
the clarifying lotion at night only
when i went out my skin was flaking even with moisturizer
moisturizer from the same line
moisturizer in this line
i no longer wear foundation or concealer
however i combat it with moisturizer
try their lotion as well
lotion are well worth the money
make sure to get the moisturizer
after i went to see my dermatologist he put me on retin-a cream
i find when i use the clarifying lotion
there is gone overnight when i dab on the gel treatment
i still have to use lotion sometimes in the winter
moisturizer for about 4 yrs now
goes on just like a lotion.
does dry out skin so use after moisturizer
make sure you apply it after your moisturizer
i saw that it was a lotion as opposed to a gel
was do pleasantly surprised when it was a gel/lotion combo instead
be sure to moisturizer before spot treating.
use this product before moisturizer
before moisturizer 2xs a day
this lotion dries my acne up so quickly.
so definitely use a good moisturizer afterward
add your facial moisturizer
is easy to apply under your moisturizer/daily routine
i combine some of this with hope in a tube moisturizer
i apply after using the acne clearing moisturizer
then i apply this gel-lotion on my pimples
compliments my normal skincare routine
the gel-lotion takes care of it right away
this lotion does not require my skin to peel off just to cure it
my mom doesn't have any problem with this lotion
this lotion doesn't dry out my skin at all
i apply the clinique moisturizer after to prevent from drying my skin
a little moisturizer fixes that
apply my moisturizer as usual
it isn't really gel-like, it's more like lotion.
purchased this on recommendation of my facialist.
it is one of the best things in my skincare regimen
you must use a good moisturizer or your face will dry out
always moisturizer and wear sun screen
it's currently my favorite skincare product
if there's anything you do, wear sunscreen!
my moisturizer has spf 47
after that is dry i use the murad serum then wait for that to dry then apply cerave pm moisturizer
then put my boots expert shine control lotion
be sure to put on a moisturizer after use
btw i really recommend shisedo sunscreen
i still continued to use the spf 30 moisturizer every morning
i diligently go back to all my creams
only use a moisturizer afterward every other night
i tend to get better results when i exfoliate first
this product is now a staple in my beauty regimen
i think he just may need a better moisturizer
follow with a matte moisturizer for zero shine for the rest of the day
i am totally in love with this moisturizer.
the cream is light
this night cream is amazing.
this cream is a great heavy enough moisturizer
i love this as a night time moisturizer
this creme is just the same
my skin literally drinks this cream
tinted moisturizer as a deluxe sample
i love their tinted moisturizers
i wasn't sure it would be moisturizing enough for me
i love this cream by far the bet night cream i tried
i love this moisturizer!
i will always use this cream!
wanted a better night cream for my winter skin
decided to try a night moisturizer
this night cream is very light
this moisturizer is perfect for people with acne prone skin
it's one of my favorite night time moisturizers to use
corresponding moisturizer for it to work well
i love this night cream!
this is a great night cream.
possibly the day moisturizer
the day moisturizers aren't as effective for my mature skin as i would like them to be
this is a great lightweight moisturizer
i like this cream
this is a great night cream
vinoperfect night correcting cream seems to work well as an excellent moisturizer
a half my past of sun tanning
this cream is great
i like this cream.
a night creme that does both?!?
it's the best product i've used for night cream!
i think i like the lotion.
this night cream is perfect weight
sdown the best night moisturizer
this is the only night moisturizer that has help the appearance of these lines
here are some of the moisturizers i tried out
bought a jar of the night cream
even though it's a great moisturizer
this is the perfect night cream.
i love this moisturizer for night use.
i started to use the un-wrinkle night moisturizer
i recommend rotating this product with the mega rich moisturizer as the unwrinkle night has retinol
remember to use a good moisturizer most acne products dry out your skin
i suggest using a good moisturizer
except eyeshadow and eyeliner lol!
no other serums made it feel like normal skin
i started using this with the clarifying lotion
didn't really use the moisturizer
would suggest pairing it with a good moisturizer
moved up to the "4" clarifying lotion.
if you're wearing a bit of concealer
i still recommend using lotion though
the acne solutions moisturizer during the day
i find that moisturizing right out of the shower does the trick
the acne moisturizer at night
it can easily be fixed with a moisturizer
or at least a moisturizer
just moisturize and you'll be good!
a light lotion is definitely needed for the after care
gentil enough to use with perscription night acne lotion
when used with the boscia oil free moisturizer
i of course follow up with a moisturizer
though i typically only wear mascara
i like to use the lotion as well 1x a day.
it's a great cleanser for those with sensitive skin although you will need to find the right moisturizer
it breaks down makeup and mascara.
this cleanser with the skin lotion is why my skin looks great without makeup
i do the same with this moisturizer.
i really like the bareminerals moisturizers sometimes i use that
so you need an appropriate moisturizer
follow with korres pomegranate moisturizer which is a freaking miracle for oily skin
follow up with a moisturizer in the morning
saw a few reviews using this as a light-weight moisturizer
night under my moisturizer
moisturizer in addition to this
do still need to use a moisturizer with this product
helps prime my face for my moisturizer
the only thing im unhappy with is the price of the moisturizer its small
i do not recommend the moisturizer as it left my skin feeling too dry
works great with the oil-free spf 15 moisturizer during the day
revitalzing hyrda lift for a moisturizer at night
i ran out of the moisturizer pretty quickly
the consistency of this is like a lotion.
the moisturizer in the same line
i am purchasing the moisturizer today.
i followed up with the redness moisturizer as well
all i can say is wow-this stuff actually works in conjunction with the redness solution moisturizer
can get away with a tinted moisturizer
along with the moisturizer
my skin always looked terrible from layering on concealer after concealer trying to hide the red
although i have an awesome moisturizer with me which has sufficient spf
then the dramatically different gel moisturizer
nothing has worked as well as this moisturizer
i like this moisturizer, it absorbs quickly.
i feel that the moisturizer is the perfect amount for my skin
so far, so good with this moisturizer.
it is my go to cream.
this stuff is your run of the mill moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer
it's a very thick moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
then follow with a moisturizer
this is a great everyday moisturizer- good consistency
very thankful for this lotion
this is the perfect moisturizer- light enough for everyday use
this moisturizer has helped tremendously!
i’ll definitely keep using this cream!
i now just use it as my day cream under my sunscreen
is a great moisturizer for my dry skin
this moisturizer helps out a lot with my redness
i tryed the moisture surge tinted moisturizer
i need to switch from a lighter moisturizer to something that can prevent my skin from chapping
so this cream is the only moisturizer i can apply to calm my face oil-free
this is the only oil free facial lotion that i have ever used that actually feels like it moisturizes
this lotion doesn't burn at all
my go to all time favorite moisturizer.
use this in addition to my normal moisturizer
the lotion itself is light
it is the only lotion i have ever found that keeps my face heathy
it is also wonderful as a daily moisturizer
now without the cream
i am in love with this moisturizer.
lightweight moisturizer that is sensitive enough for your skin
this cream helps to take care of that
started using a different moisturizer
not the most expensive cream or lotion i've tried by a long shot
the moisturizer is really nice
this cream is amazing!
although i usually layer it over my daily cerave lotion
use it as a daily moisturizer
like any moisturizer would
can't live without this lotion!
i love this moisturizer.
it is the only moisturizer i use in the winter time
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is the best hands down!!!
i've only been using it in the morning because it's not moisturizing enough for a night cream for my skin
i love this cream
this cream is nice
it nourishes my skin better than any other moisturizer i've used
it is a great moisturizer
i still need moisturizer after using the serum
i do love to pamper my skin with dior products
i love it and itmakes my skin wrinkle friee.
day moisturizer i've used in the last 2 years that keeps my skin moisturized throughout the afternoon
the spf in this cream is not irrating like many other products with spf
i love this cream
shisedo benefiance nutriperfect day cream is a good moisturizer for dry
i originally purchased the nutriperfect day cream with sunscreen
i started using shiseido moisturizers
have " raised them on sunscreen"
i also use shiseido's benefience eye cream
this cream isn't that oily
i really like this cream.
i also use the daytime cream too.
you don't wanna do a harsh exfoliation
i found this to be a good exfoliator
i feel that my moisturizer penetrates the skin
put some nude repair oil and a moisturizer.
i gave it a 4 because it's my first exfoliating mask that i use once a week
this is my favorite exfoliating mask hands down.
potent vitamin c powder that can be added to your own favorite moisturizer
i mix this with my moisturizer during the winter.
also, may need moisturizer on top.
i mix it in with my moisturizer in the morning
i don't smell anything other than my moisturizer
the only downfall: i mix this with my moisturizer
s after applying my moisturizer
i love being able to use my favorite facial cream
i mixed it in with my lotion
i mix it in every morning with my regular moisturizer
after using this powder in my moisturizer i saw a dramatic change in the texture of my skin
either mixing in my serum or moisturizer
i can use the booster powder/moisturizer then top off with laura mercier primer
in the day i mix with spf moisturizer.
it turned the moisturizer into a water consistency
i find that it pills up weirdly if you mix it with a high spf moisturizer
i like the fact that i can use it with my favorite moisturizer
it only works best if you add to a liquid moisturizer
you can use with a cream moisturizer
i mix a scoop with my ren moisturizer to use every morning
then i apply moisturizer and sun block.
i add some to my sunscreen
a lotion-type of moisturizer works best
i mix it with my loreal face lotion
i mix it with my acne moisturizer day & night.
definitely worth the little bit of extra work to mix it with your moisturizer
i mix this with moisturizer in the morning
use one of the philosophy retinol product at night
i mix it with my clinique moisturizer
i mix this with my daily moisturizer which is neutrogena combo skin day/night
trick is to use the right consistency of moisturizer
then adding my moisturizer
i mix this in with my sunscreen
very easy to use just mix a scoop with your favorite serum or moisturizer
it's a great addition to any serum or moisturizer
half at night in my moisturizer or my serum depending on the moisture my skin needs
this stuff works wonders in combination with exfoliating morning
i mix it with my daytime moisturizer
i add it every morning to my josie maran moisturizer
i don't use a fancy moisturizer
mixed into a facial oil which i then put under my moisturizer w/ sunscreen
one of the best things you can do for your skin: dermatologists state that using vitamins c
the first time i used a whole spoon mixed with my miracle worker moisturizer
it blends easily with my clinique dramatically difference moisturizer
i always apply a sunscreen after that
then top it off with sunscreen
a little spoonful in my moisturizer daily
it's so fun to mix the powder with my moisturizer
i typically use this with my morning moisturizer.
ard moisturizer every morning
adds a little kick in the pants to your daily moisturizer
simply mix it in with your daily moisturizer.
it mixes into my moisturizer nicely.
if you want to bump up your moisturizer to new benefits add a tiny spoonful of this product to it
i love the fact that you can use this vitamin c powder with any of my serums or moisturizers
i've always covered them with concealer
any serum or moisturizer works just fine
you only need a smidgen to add to your serum/ moisturizer
after using the powder with my regular moisturizer
probably through 2-3 jars of moisturizer
regardless of what moisturizer or treatment i add it to
my moisturizer is more effective with this product
no matter what moisturizer i used
this goes well under my concealer too.
works well under concealer
it was way more than i like to spend on eye creams
love this eye cream.
as if the cream was leaving a kind of shear concealer
perfect for under-eye concealers.
i love this eye cream
it is a good moisturizer for eye
my concealer goes on very well
i've tried quite a few eye expensive creams
it is true that my concealer goes on more flawlessly since using this
then put on an melon based creamy concealer
don't want to put on concealer as it has a light reflective
this is the only moisturizer i know use.
no concealer would make them disappear.
i started using this cream
one of the best eye creams i have ever used!
it's an excellent moisturizer
this eye cream is amazing
this cream is light- definitely a day-time cream.
i would say this is one of the better eye creams i've tried

that is the limit to creams
i never have to use concealer under my eyes
no need for highlighter or concealer
sometimes forget to use concealer!
i do like this eye cream
four stars because i cannot tell if its actually "whitening" or just an eye cream
this has been my holy grail moisturizer for close to 7 years
this moisturizer feels amazing going on.
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used
i hate heavy moisturizer in the heat
this one is really good light weight moisturizer it's helped my skin improve a lot
followed by my moisturizer

if you like a drier feel this is a decent moisturizer
i never thought i needed a moisturizer
the only moisturizer i've used for the last 7 years- it's so light
this moisturizer is amazing.
this is my perfect summer moisturizer.
this lotion is a game changer!
this is a great moisturizer!!
i tried the yellow moisturizer from clinique
i really like this moisturizer.
this is a great, lightweight moisturizer.
for this moisturizer i had to

then i put on this moisturizer right after
personally this is a great daytime summer moisturizer for me
this moisturizer is a lifesaver.
this is a great pre-makeup moisturizer.
this is my favourite moisturizer
this gel moisturizer is exactly what my skin needs
if your an oily/combo person you will love this moisturizer
moisture surge is the only moisturizer that didn't break me out
it's a good, high-quality moisturizer.
by far the best moisturizer i have ever used
i kind of just bought this product on impulse since i needed a new moisturizer
looked for a good oil-free moisturizer
definitely recommend people to try in the travel size since it is a pricey moisturizer
because i applied the lotion liberally
every lotion i try only helps with one problem
my favorite drug store one is cerave facial moisturizing lotion pm
lightweight moisturizer for soooo long
this is definitely my new favorite moisturizer.
super moisturizing yet so light that you cant even tell you have a moisturizer on
this is my favourite moisturizer to use
this is now my holy grail moisturizer!
my go to face lotion.
purchasing for my everyday moisturizer!
in the summer, this is my holy grail moisturizer.

i will forever call this product my primary moisturizer
best moisturizer i've ever used!
soft after using it my favorite moisturizer
i tried to switch to a cheaper lotion option
i wanted something i could also use as a good daily moisturizer in a pinch
this moisturizer is perfect!
my favorite moisturizer for under my makeup- never greasy
this is basically my ideal moisturizer.
i also layer this underneath a heavier moisturizer with sunscreen in it
i've used this moisturizer every night for at least 4 years
this moisturizer works so well for me.
this is a must have moisturizer for me.
lightweight moisturizer is just what my skin needed
i love this moisturizer.
my only wish is that the moisturizer had some anti aging benefits
i am really loving this moisturizer.
my foundation applies evenly after applying this moisturizer
lotion is light and not greasy.
this goes on like a cream
low for a lightweight moisturizer that won't break me out
i started using this as a night time moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
i've only been using this facial moisturizer for a short time
this moisturizer gives my skin a glow
instantly fell in love with this moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer i wear.
i love this moisturizer
i previously used bobbi browns face moisturizer
i've used this moisturizer for over a year now
this is the absolute best moisturizer i have ever used
i splurged on this moisturizer
i absolutely love this lotion!
i would say that this is more of a primer than moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
the one moisturizer that doesn't contri
this moisturizer has completely saved my skin.
i don't think i could ever use a different moisturizer
that is more than my retinol cream was doing.
this moisturizer is amazing.
this moisturizer works well alone or over photo plasma
it is a great moisturizer
if you like clinique face moisturizer
it became my absolute go-to nighttime moisturizer
not the absolute best moisturizer i've tried
get a lighter day moisturizer
i started using this moisturizer
this moisturizer feels smooth going on
i got a sample of this moisturizer
t's very hard for me to find a good moisturizer to wear on the daytime underneath my foundation
this moisturizer tingles every time i use it
my face has never glowed like it does after i use this moisturizer
i personally prefer moisturizer with scent so this one is perfect for me
this moisturizer is a dream come true.
i'd rather have that than a moisturizer loaded with fragrances that leave my face feeling sticky
i really think this moisturizer makes my skin smoother
i really like this cream.
i love that this cream-potion doesn't leave my face looking
when i wear my normal moisturizers
this moisturizer does smell better than some of the other products in this line
there are other moisturizers that i prefer
not too over moisturizer for a summer day
moisturizer has done more than i ever anticipated for my skin
have never found a great moisturizer that lasts
i love this moisturizer.
perricone's face finishing moisturizer for 10 years now
when you get results as i have with this moisturizer
the center of it being face finishing moisturizer
i find this to be a very good moisturizer for my dry
keep coming back to this moisturizer.
i find this to be great daytime moisturizer
overall i think this is a great moisturizer for normal to dry skin types
this moisturizer is fantastic
with this moisturizer i have none of that
however i do like this facial cream.
i absolutely love this facial moisturizer
i am pretty picky when it comes to moisturizers.
over the years i have spent a fortune on moisturizers
this moisturizer is awesome.
s down this is the best moisturizer i have ever used
i wouldn't call this my hg moisturizer quite yet
it makes applying moisturizer feel luxurious
it really does what a true moisturizer should unlike many drugstore br
i absolutely love this moisturizer
this moisturizer has changed my skin for the better
the best face cream i've ever used
you don't need to put a moisturizer on top
until i ran out of my other moisturizer
it is a treatment not a moisturizer.
the salesperson recommended this cream
i started with the face finishing moisturizer
i now only wear a tinted moisturizer
i am always a bit wary of any moisturizers
the firming cream is my favorite.
i love this cream
have to use a good moisturizer afterwards
moisturizer combo works without being oily
the all day moisturizer
a lot of vitamins and doesn't dry your skin.
so far one of the best concealers
trust me when i say every single concealer creased on me
once you apply the concealer
this eye cream is the best cream i ever used.
whats incredible is that this moisturizer lasts all day long
i love this eye cream.
it is the best eye cream.
i love this eye cream!
i've tried many very expensive eye creams
ihave tried zillions of eye creams
have facials about every 8 weeks with eye cream recommendation galore
make sure to use sunblock
tight afterwards unless i also use a moisturizer
i also use perricone's face finishing moisturizer
the moisturizer adds just the right amount of moisturizer without looking greasy
i am always open to something new in the skincare
i follow up with a good moisturizer and bb cream.
sometimes waterproof mascara requires an extra go
i've also been using the clear skin moisturizer
the face finishing moisturizer
love this eye cream!
it leaves your skin perfect for a good moisturizer
perricone's face finishing moisturizer is my favorite
i could skip concealer
this is the best moisturizer i've used post-menopause
the 'skin specialist' recommend that i start using this moisturizer
because it is not a great moisturizer for dry skin
i tried a dab of this moisturizer
just dab a heavier weight moisturizer on my problem dry areas
if i want to fight aging i need to use a good moisturizer with antioxidants to battle the aging process
this moisturizer fits the bill
which i think this moisturizer has a lot to do with
this is a fabulous hydrating cream with lots of extra bells
i never feel this contented with any skincare creme before trying on this one
pair with the eye syrum and wrinkle cream.
i find i often don't need a moisturizer with this product
moisturizers work when using this first
it should always be used first with any moisturizer
toner, moisturizer, and treatment all in one!
moisturizer really isn't needed using this face wash either
that is fixed when paired with applying a moisturizer after
i put moisturizer on immediately after
it's no match for my liner/mascara
i follow up with my nurture me moisturizer in the day or the pure truth youth activating oil at night
using just the moisturizer
you definitely need a moisturizer after using this
as long as i apply moisturizer its perfect
didn't break out from the sunscreens.
i still have concealer on my trouble spots
can't say enough good hingis about this moisturizer
use ole henriksen's nurture me moisturizer afterwards
probably more what i would call a lotion
the super aqua day cream i noticed a dramatic difference in my skin from the intensive hydration
for summer i need a lighter moisturizer that won't make my skin feel greasy in hot
great all-purpose face moisturizer.
it's a perfect day cream for my skin type.
by far the best moisturizer i have ever used!!!
my favorite moisturizer i've ever used!
i wear sunscreen on my face daily over this
this lotion is amazing!!!
i really like this ren moisturizer.
it was difficult finding a nice moisturizer that is unscented
this is my new holy grail moisturizer.
light moisturizer with just enough richness for dry skin
this moisturizer is perfect for my sensitive
this is a great moisturizer
this moisturizer is all i use
my skin is so much softer when i use this moisturizer than any other i've ever used
this is that moisturizer.
this moisturizer feels great going on
this is an amazing moisturizer that doesn't make me break out
i love this moisturizer!
even i normally use a lighter moisturizer from ren range
i love this cream
great moisturizer for every day.
the only thing i've changed up in my face moisturizer
i simply cannot wear your moisturizer
i love this moisturizer it light weight
it's been my favorite moisturizer ever since.
it comes out like a cream
it doesn't dry out as fast as a gel-like moisturizer
this cream is so lightweight
this is such a great moisturizer!
it's a bit thicker than other moisturizers
this moisturizer is amazing.

all-round excellent daily moisturizer!
i love the way this moisturizer feels
i like this day cream
this moisturizer goes on smooth
this is the best moisturizer that i've ever used.
this day moisturizer is great.
the radiance that this cream gives is a noticeable one that i really liked about this moisturizer
i usually use boscia's spf 15 daily moisturizer
this moisturizer is good for spring and summer.
i really like this moisturizer
this day cream works great
creams that are lighter tend to not moisturize enough for me
this moisturizer is the best one i have ever used
this moisturizer is the only thing that works
this is a perfect cream.
this product is a great lightweight moisturizer
this is a very good product as a moisturizer.
you will love this rich day cream
this moisturizer makes my skin smooth
for you skin care junkies this is a light moisturizing day cream which feels comfortable
doesn't pill even after layers of my active skin care products
great moisturizer that feels like it's actually working
after countless attempts to find a decent moisturizer
so i needed a good moisturizer.
i actually really enjoy the scent in this moisturizer
i know it's a moisturizer
this is one of the best moisturizers i have ever used
this moisturizer does not irritate my skin

the moisturizer is great

this moisturizer is giving me life
this cream is great
all in all a great moisturizer!
when you don't need a moisturizer with sunscreen
it's hard to find a good moisturizer
i love this cream.
this moisturizer smells so good
i really like this moisturizer
it is definitely my go to for a.m moisturizer
doesnt not burn skin like some moisturizer
thats pretty much all moisturizers
this isn't a very powerful moisturizer
even the clinique redness solution moisturizer breaks me out easily
it is one of my favorite moisturizers
this cream has a lovely consistency that is thicker than a moisturizer without being heavy
i love this cream!
i found it- my perfect daily moisturizer.
most day creams have spf which makes my sensitive skin break out
i love this moisturizer.
this is the absolutely best moisturizer i've ever used
i am so happy with this moisturizer along with the companion serum
this all natural day cream really is the bomb!
this moisturizer is perfect for everyday use
i am in love with this moisturizer!
it is my favorite face cream
this product was recommended to me by a salesperson for use as an evening lotion
this moisturizer is wonderful as a daily moisturizer
i wish it was a tad more moisturizing for my dryer days
it can be difficult for me to find a moisturizer that works
i put this under my sunscreen
this moisturizer is a must have.
the only moisturizer that works on my dry
i love this cream
i love this moisturizer
going without any moisturizer for months
this is by far the best moisturizer i have ever bought
this is a great moisturizer for people with sensitive skin
i just purchased my second bottle of this cream
this moisturizer is so wonderful (; !
needed advice on a new moisturizer to try once i healed up
this day cream is amazing
by this face cream
hundreds of dollars trying to find the right moisturizer
it is the perfect day time moisturizer.
i can't use it as my night time moisturizer just because i do need a little more hydration
this ren moisturizer is the first product that i have used that works well with my face
i finally found a moisturizer that's perfect for my skin
best moisturizer for super oily tzone with normal to dry cheeks
i love this product as a daytime moisturizer.
i really like this as a night time moisturizer.
it's been a very nice night time moisturizer for my oily congested skin
'm not a huge fan of moisturizers
this is the star of my skincare routine.
i've tried countless moisturizers to help keep my skin matte
this moisturizer is the best thing i have found.
i do still wear moisturizer
a lady at sephora recommended this moisturizer for my combination skin
its actually really rare for me to like a moisturizer
this one is a great moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer.
i found this moisturizer after doing a quiz on the skintypesolution website
a moisturizer to balance my oily t-zone
i need a moisturizer that can both conquer dry spots
this is the best moisturizer i have ever bought!
i really like this as a moisturizer
i really, really love this moisturizer.
but this lotion really is great.
this moisturizer really does help control oil
then use the global moisturizer for sensitive skin at night
since using this product line i have been able to just wear a tinted moisturizer
was so happy when i found this amazing moisturizer
i like this moisturizer!
the lotion feels great.
have to change to a different moisturizer
i love this cream!
this creamy moisturizer is heavy duty for dry canadian weather
i wouldn't use this as a day moisturizer
i knew i needed something more moisturizing
i'll use the fresh moisturizer when i need something a tad lighter
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
i tried a different fresh cream-the lighter one with spf in it-
it is definitely a night cream
very good cream for anti aging.
i love this cream!
i just kept using my lighter moisturizer
i love this cream.
this cream is great
i am in love with this moisturizer
this cream is amazing
i love this cream!
this moisturizer got me.
wonderful moisturizer that leaves your skin looking amazing
this is the best night cream/moisturizer i've found
use the eye cream also
i love the dewy feeling my skin has after applying this cream to my face
this moisturizer is my all time favorite.
for now i'll stay loyal to lancôme's night creams
very few lotions work for me
this cream is the best moisturizer i have ever used
you need a substantial moisturizer
at first its like a normal cream/lotion
i love this cream.
it is a great cream
would definitely recommend this moisturizer
serums just makes my skin feel so good
this is a great cream
then use my ptr moisturizing sunscreen in the a
i slather some on
any time i use water on my face i feel i need a moisturizer
it has the consistency of a moisturizer
i've paid this for serums
i still use an eye makeup removing serum since i wear waterproof mascara
moisturizer or make-up
i would suggest using a moisturizer after
while i liked it as long as i immediately put on my moisturizer
the mousse is the perfect solution for my combination skin
lots of sunscreen for years
additional moisturizer for dry skin
still worth it if you have a good moisturizer
leaving it prepped for moisturizer
i just make sure to lather moisturizer
right after i apply the lancôme toner my skin feels amazing
nothing a bit of moisturizer can't help counteract
almost like a thick moisturizer in the beginning
it says exactly what it does from creme to foam.
very easy to remove mascara
won't remove your mascara well
although i don't use waterproof mascara
foundation/ bb cream/ sunscreen
i also wear a good amount of black mascara
even water proof eyeliner
even those hard-to-come-off lipsticks
follow it with a light lotion
mixed with foundation or concealer
ter it has eradicated my dry patches with the help of a gel moisturizer before
suggested this product to use as a moisturizer since my skin is very dry
it's the only moisturizer for my under eyes that works at night
use it as a moisturizer
i also mix moisturizer with a few drops of this oil
hands down best moisturizer ever.
i add just a literal drop of this to my night time moisturizer
am always searching for a light weight product to moisturize
i tried switching to more expensive gel or cream moisturizers because they were touted as being "magical"
i picked up this oil when i decided i was done using traditional moisturizers
now that i slather my skin in oil my skin isn't oily
mix a drop of the oil into your daily moisturizer
or feeling like i had pounds of greasy moisturizer on my face
night after my moisturizers
i wouldn't use this as a moisturizer in the morning
i originally bought this to replace my night time moisturizer
i used so many moisturizers
as a moisturizer around my eyes
i tried to use this as an all over moisturizer
works as a great moisturizer
i add about 2-3 drops to my moisturizer before bed
everyday as an eye cream
makes concealer sit like a dream
moisturizers typically make my skin way more oily than it should be
i mix this with my moisturizer
my skin care is now josie m aragn oil + my moisturizer
this is an amazing moisturizer even for every day use
seems to work with any moisturizer.
moisturizer quickly became favorites
i usually use the moisturizer as part of my night routine
it truly moisturizers it all days
also underneath my sunblock in the morning
when i place my moisturizer on top it helps my skin absorb it quicker
as i've always used a cream moisturizer
i like to apply belief moisturizing bomb on top of it at night
i just need a smidge of this to hydrate without that feeling of a heavier moisturizer
i used this with my moisturizer
before this i repeatedly had to apply moisturizer
i layer kate somerville oil free moisturizer over this when my skin needs some extra hydration
use this serum right after before applying my face cream
within a week i noticed significantly more moisturizer skin
better absorption of my normal moisturizer
sometimes forget to add moisturizer after
is a very lightweight product that is better use under moisturizer
moisturizer earlier this year
you have to apply a moisturizer on top
i go through ultra-rich moisturizers like crazy.
after the viz dries i apply my moisturizer
i can use less moisturizer than without it
the moisturizer works much longer
this for goes on under my moisturizer
now my skin now no longer stings after moisturizing now that i use this serum
then an intense lotion
it is a great partner with whatever night moisturizer you may use
i didn't notice much of a difference when using it under moisturizer versus just moisturizer
i put it on right before my moisturizer
just one pump of the bottle is all i use in the am before i slather on my thomas roth moisturizer
i added this to my moisturizer at night
i also use the ultra light moisturizer with this gel
followed by my ole moisturizer
i would apply this atop of my moisturizer to retain more moisture
have noticed myself using less moisturizer than before
i do not use another moisturizer this is it
this serum will be part of my beauty routine for a long
i just add amoisture cream
i also use this with any other moisturizer just to add a bit more hydration
under an oil free moisturizer
my moisturizer absorbs better
you need to apply a moisturizer after applying this product
this is a serum, not a moisturizer.
have tried every moisturizer
just one little squirt before i put on my moisturizer
i don't have to reapply moisturizer during the day anymore
after applying i used the josie marn sun protection argan oil with a dab of dior nude concealer
i've tried everything to moisturize it with no success
so you can immediately put on your moisturizer
followed with regular moisturizers
makes a nice canvas for moisturizer
is a perfect addition before your moisturizer
layer your favorite moisturizer on top
it is not a moisturizer
i think it is helping my moisturizer perform better
i've tried nearly every sunscreen on the market.
this is such an amazing moisturizer
i wanted a lightweight day cream with the protection of spf
this is my most favorite moisturizer .
i always find myself coming back to this moisturizer
it's an age defense moisturizer.
after a month of using this moisturizer my skin looked healthier
this is a great moisturizer.
there's sunscreen in it
it's a shame because this was great under my foundation as an extra sunblock/antioxidant moisturizer
there is a slight sunscreen scent to it
and it definitely does not feel like sunscreen!
had trouble finding an everyday moisturizer with spf
this is the perfect moisturizer
it works as a nice moisturizer
this moisturizer is so worth the price.
this is a really nice daytime moisturizer
this moisturizer is either perfect or not enough for me
don't have the extra step of sunscreen
having combination skin makes it hard to find the right moisturizer
have always put sunscreen on my face
this cream is amazing
i really like this moisturizer.
my number one concern with a daily moisturizer is that is has a good amount of spf to protect my fair skin
this is a thicker moisturizer
a clilnique salesperson told me to use this after the dramatically different moisturizing lotion/gel
while this is more than i'd like to spend on my skincare
i really like this moisturizer losts of spf
i am very sensitive to sunblock
great moisturizer with spf
this is why it's best to get the combination type of this spf moisturizer
truly my favorite moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer for oily/combo skin.
i am always a fan of moisturizer with spf
i needed a moisturizer for oily skin
this clinique moisturizer is a miracle in a jar!
only complaint, it smells like sunscreen.
the consistency is creamy somewhat like a sunscreen
this is my first spf daily moisturizer.
i really like this moisturizer
all the other great benefits from this moisturizer are worth it
-in for my regular sunscreen/moisturizer from murad
tried other moisturizers at sephora
i love this moisturizer.
it is so hard to find an oil free high spf moisturizer
decided to try this since i love clinique's dramatically different moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer that does not break my skin out
with that said this clinique moisturizer is perfect for me
anti wrinkle all that i need in my moisturizer
this has been the only facial sunscreen i have used that is actually lightweight
this is the best moisturizer w/ spf that i've tried thus far
this is the best moisturizer i've found so far
my only complaint is that my dermatologist stresses that my facial moisturizer/sunscreen should be at least spf 30
this moisturizer changed that.
followed by an application of this perfect moisturizer on my face
the best part is that i finally found a great moisturizer for my oily skin
i love this moisturizer!
overall i am in love with this moisturizer
this is also the most spf i've found in a facial moisturizer
i used this moisturizer before
will continue to invest in this lotion
this moisturizer is great for people with oily skin
this is the first moisturizer i have used that i don't glisten
before using this moisturizer
i even tried the new clinique youth surge moisturizer
i've tried high-end moisturizers
have tried so many moisturizers
sometimes i find that the lotion moisturizer
i switched over to the gel moisturizer which is practically the same as the lotion
hate to change my moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!!!
this provides good sunscreen.
this is one of the only moisturizers that offers a uva protection
very good light moisturizer.
like so many other moisturizers with sunscreen do
i layer it over the dramatically different moisturizer
overall i really love this moisturizer
in the warmer months i use sunscreen with at least spf 45 instead
this is the best sunscreen i've used to date.
have yet to find a better oily skin sunscreen.
so far, i really like this moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer because it helps to improve the look of your skin by reducing puffiness
it's not greasy at all like most sunscreen
was on the hunt for a moisturizer with spf when i discovered this
this has been my everyday go-to moisturizer for years
best sunscreen for my face
this is by far my favorite moisturizer.
love this moisturizer because it is thicker which is especially great for new engl
switched over to this moisturizer
i find this moisturizer very good
absolutely love this moisturizer just the right amount of spf
i pair it with the mild clarifying lotion
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
now i'll be able to use this moisturizer all year round
although i usually also wear a high-end facial sunblock underneath this moisturizer because of the super hot
it has sunscreen spf20 which is an added bonus
a little concealer under the eyes
i love this moisturizer for my dry acne prone combination skin
i love this moisturizer!
i keep trying other moisturizers
there are definitely other moisturizers that work better for me
provides that added sunblock
will try something a little more moisturizing next time
i wanted an unsecent moisturizer that was light
i just switched over to this day cream because my old shiseido sunblock was way too drying for my skin
i think i found my new spf day cream.
finally a moisturizer with spf that does not block the pores
i love this moisturizer.
the fragrance of the lotion is awful
the moisturizer is thick
becuase its not a mineral sunscreen
this cream is not to rich
this is theonly moisturizer i will use.
the other moisturizers i've tried are too heavy or too light
my go to face cream.
clear lotion i had been using
finding a moisturizer with spf was a must
a little bit of the moisturizer goes a long way
i tried buying more expensive moisturizers
it is a great moisturizer
it is my everyday moisturizer
i love the fact that it has an spf 25 as opposed to an spf 15 which most moisturizers have
the spf 25 is an added bonus in a fantastic moisturizer
unlike a lot of other moisturizers with sun protection
doesn't smell like sunscreen
this moisturizer is great
i will put on an extra layer of regular sunscreen
needed a good moisturizer with spf
or any other exfoliator before applying this moisturizer
the moisturizer feels very good
this moisturizer is definitely preventing my skin from looking haggard
a very good moisturizer for mature skin.
it has a higher spf than most other moisturizers
has sunscreen so better in that regard
i love the superdefense spf 25 moisturizer.
most moisturizers with spf can leave my skin looking
this is a great cream.
i really like the light weight feeling of this moisturizer
i've tried other age defense moisturizers
usually don't like feel of spf in moisturizers
i usually really hate the feeling of sunblock
the feeling of moisturizer on my face
as sunblock/moisturizer usually does
this is my favorite daytime moisturizer!
this moisturizer has literally abolished the flaking i used to have
this moisturizer is the best moisturizer that i have ever used
this is by far my favorite daytime moisturizer ever
usually sunscreen products break my skin out the day after use
i am willing to dab on some powder for the great sunscreen effects
this moisturizer holds up when i need it to
i love this moisturizer for the spf
the spf 25 is great- i had been using a separate moisturizer
this works great as a daily moisturizer
this moisturizer feels great on the skin
after 4 days of using this moisturizer
it does feel a bit like sunscreen when applying
perfect moisturizer for the summer months.
this moisturizer is wonderful for dry skin.
sunscreen products never do well with the eye area
im very pleased with this moisturizer
this product is the lightest weight moisturizer ive ever used that has sunscreen in it
it also doesn't smell of sunscreen at all
which happens alot with moisturizers
it is a good moisturizer with good price.
this moisturizer is perfect all year long!
has to be the best day moisturizer ever.
this moisturizer is really wonderful.
this is a full-bodied, well-covering moisturizer.
this moisturizer is a godsend.
this is a good moisturizer
this moisturizer is great!
i also like the texture of the moisturizer
it smells a bit of sunscreen at first
i swear by this moisturizer.
clinique doesn't add perfume to it's skincare i think
it doesn't feel sticky or greasy like most sunblock moisturizers do
this all in one moisturizer takes the guess work out of wondering how to add sunscreen to your daily ritual
plus i get the benefit of a great clinique moisturizer
use a heavier moisturizer for nighttime
this is a great face cream.
gave me a few trial packets of this moisturizer
i tried it as a facial moisturizer
i decided to try this cream.
i wish it had some mineral sunscreen in it
slightly damp when applying this lotion
i finally found a fabulous daily moisturizer.
really what i need was a good moisturizer
love this moisturizer for my very dry skin!!
this is a great moisturizer for the winter.
most moisturizers give out before the end of the day
this is the best cream ever.
it keeps my face hyrdrated more than any other moisturizer i have tried
this moisturizer is fabulous!
if they ever discontinue this moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer i have ever tried that not only moisturizes my very dry skin
it sits on the skin a bit more than other moisturizers
it's an amazing moisturizer
i love this cream!!!
found this hard to use as a daily moisturizer
i love using it as a night moisturizer
i love this cream
i love this moisturizer.
i adore this moisturizer
i layer the calendula cream on top of this
the only other product i have found that is actually more moisturizing
jurlique's moisture replenishing day cream is the most beautiful face cream i have ever used
this moisturizer fulfill my needs
this face cream is rich
i've purchased this moisturizer twice now
i love this moisturizer.
i just bought this moisturizer for the second time
i wanted to buy a good eye cream for prevention
their night cream is actually lighter than the day cream
i need a heavier moisturizer at both times
i love this cream
use it under my tinted moisturizer when i feel i need extra moisture
wants a basic under eye moisturizer
it is not a heavy anti-aging cream
just a bit of the cream
sometimes need to use another moisturizer too
best cream i have tried.
the cream is light
i noticed that i am using less concealer now
does not budge under concealer
i started using the eye cream
i love this eye cream!!!!
i love this cream.
it is perfect under concealer
legit the best moisturizer i have ever purchased.
currently my routine consists of this product for a moisturizer
then i apply with a beauty blender the bare minerals tinted moisturizer
also performs well as a sunscreen
it works very well as a moisturizer.
this moisturizer works amazing
seriously the best daytime moisturizer i have ever used
works great as a moisturizer that keeps oily skin at bay
this moisturizer helps fight oils all day
said i should start with basics like moisturizer
i really like when my moisturizer has spf because i am a student
i find every moisturizer causes me to be shiny by midday
only moisturizer i have used that moisturizes my skin yet keeps it matte all day
it's by far the best moisturizer i've ever tried
only moisturizer that actually kept my skin from producing excess oily
after my sephora associate recommended this moisturizer i finally could go a whole day oil free
ever since i used this lotion
this is one of my absolute favorite moisturizers
making it hard to find a good moisturizer
i wouldn't have bought this for an everyday moisturizer
it's unlike any moisturizer i've used yet.
now it's a lotion i can't live without
soft like this moisturizer
i added a thicker moisturizer in the places that i am more dry
i love this moisturizer
then moisturizer if you use it
this has been a great moisturizer for me year round
this is a great moisturizer for oily skin.
this is by far the best moisturizer i have ever used
this product does a good job of keeping my skiing matte for several hours
this has been the best mattifying moisturizer i have used without making my skin dry out
with all of the mattifying
this moisturizer stays lighter during the day
any skin moisturizer that i've tried with a decent amount of spf is oily
this moisturizer does a great job keeping it in check
the lotions i had been trying would add to my oiliness even in the winter
the fact thats its a moisturizer
every single lotion i've tried has made me oily except this one
i tried the clear start oil clearing mattifying moisturizer
apply an average amount of my regular moisturizer
i am reminded how effective the moisturizer actually is
s down my all time favorite oil free moisturizer
all sunscreens break me out except this one!
i love this sunscreen.
moisturize after this and you should be ok.
wash with this & even my mascara comes off.
definitely a skin regimen staple.
follow up with a light weight moisturizer
so make sure you apply moisturizer after washing your face with it
moisturizer would take that away
just follow up quickly with moisturizer!
definitely need to apply a moisturizer after using this
needing to wear a daily sunscreen
to wearing a lotion i'd probably break out
the facial sunscreen to anyone
i even use an oil moisturizer
thankfully my nightly moisturizer tones it down
i now want to try their exfoliator.
i also got the sunscreen
it's not the best for removing heavy duty waterproof foundation or long lasting concealer or eye makeup
i love this moisturizer.
this is my new favorite day cream.
i love this moisturizer for the winter months.
i've never seen results like this before in a moisturizer
this is my favorite moisturizer.
this moisturizer is really amazing.
had previously been using a moisturizer
this does the work of both a moisturizer
i love this cream.
as far as a moisturizer
i do, and love this moisturizer.
this cream is very light
i love having the spf 15 protection in a light weight moisturizer
rich moisturizer which does make your wrinkles less prominent
i used other moisturizers
all at the same time is an anti-wrinkle cream
this is an excellent moisturizer for daily use.
i tried this moisturizer
i love this night cream
i love this night cream.
i've never seen results like this before in a moisturizer
goes great under my concealer.
i still however would recommend this cream for starter wrinkles bc it is a great hydrating cream
use the shiseido wrinkle-care eye cream at night because it is much richer
as soon as the associate swept this eye cream with a concealer brush under my eyes i felt the coolness
i love this eye cream!
it does sink in nicely for a smooth base for concealer also
if i apply a concealer over it
i love this eye cream
concealer goes on better over the cream
i love this cream!
i love this eye cream.
the use algenist eye cream
i love this eye cream!
have been using this eye lotion for years
this perricone cream is good.
if you use it after eye moisturizer
you may need an extra moisturizer with this product
i love this eye cream.
when i applied the concealer it did not go on smoothly
wondering if after the eye lift application should i be applying another eye cream prior to the concealer ?
i can't even wear mascara!
this replaces my pre-concealer primer.
my concealer goes on smoothly
great base for your anti-aging eye cream
apply the lotion to face & neck3.
then apply a nightly heavy moisturizer
in the am apply a lighter moisturizer then apply sunscreen spf 30
this product is perfect skin in a bottle
in my daily moisturizer for luminosity
the best way i've found this to work is to put a moisturizer on
i do recommend using moisturizer in the am after using this
combining it with a moisturizer
i would recommend this to anyone who wants a good retinol lotion
this moisturizer is amazing
also a moisturizer with sunscreen during the day
it takes a while for your skin to adjust to the retinol
moisturizers during the day
i don't use a moisturizer following this
without moisturizer about once per week because my skin is sensitive
i love this cream.
i recommend using this cream with the philosophy retinol pads
absolutely loving this lotion.
this lotion is fabulous
one essential addition to this stuff--sunscreen!
i recommend mixing a bit of this with your regular moisturizer
also be sure to wear sunscreen during the day- always
error how careful i had to be with this lotion
it's the first time i can use a tinted moisturizer
always use with sunblock during the day after nighttime use
always use under a moisturizer.
i just love this lotion as a night time treatment
philosophy miracle worker moisturizer
my regular eye cream
moisturizer would burn when applied on my off nights
this is my first retinol cream.
each time i applied moisturizer
i've only used this lotion a few times so far
good things to say about poetry in lotion
a good sunscreen will be your best friends
this lotion is so amazing
sunscreen is a must with this product
just make sure you wear a good sunscreen every day
this is my first retinol product
it feels fine once i apply the poetry in lotion again
then really moisturize when i don't use it
this is my first retinol product
i love this moisturizer
i see a huge difference when i use this compare to my other moisturizers
i think this moisturizer is helping me
this moisturizer is so lightweight
the use of this lotion
lightweight this cream was
currently i'm using this moisturizer on both morning
this has been my moisturizer for a long time
i tried the travel size recently as was recommended this daily moisturizer over an ole hendrickson product
never used a moisturizer before
i highly recommend this kate somerville moisturizer
i switched to a cheaper moisturizer
this moisturizer has a great consistency
i love this moisturizer!
got a sample of this moisturizer
this is the first moisturizer that didn't burn my skin
it took a little while for this moisturizer to grow on me
i really like this moisturizer.
this moisturizer has been great for my sensitive
it's actually the cheapest product i have found to be hydrating
a little more than i usually spend on moisturizer
every day moisturizer that isn't heavy on my pretty sensitive skin
i love this moisturizer.
i fell in love with this moisturizer
this is a lovely mid-weight moisturizer for night time
i absolutely love that this dispenses just the right amount of moisturizer for my whole face
i find that this is one of my moisturizers that i use the most
the best moisturizer i've tried.
i started using the moisturizer
this is the best daily moisturizer that i've used
was in the market for a new moisturizer
goes well with the daily moisturizer for sensitive skin
i also liked that i could just apply this moisturizer all over
i've tried a number of different moisturizers for my combination/sensitive to vitamin e skin
found good reviews for this moisturizer
i looooove this moisturizer.
my skin broke out from layering on sunblock every day
this moisturizer completely cleared my breakout
this moisturizer is light
yes it may seem like your basic moisturizer
i do not use this at night i prefer to use a heavier lotion such as fresh lotus youth preserve
it was the first time i've ever seen that with a moisturizer
this moisturizer really really really helped
i really like the nourish daily moisturizer in the kate somerville line of products
nourish is my moisturizer of choice in the spring
the moisturizer comes up through the center of the jar
nourish does not contain spf which i like as i use this moisturizer day
it's a perfect summer/spring moisturizer
$90 is steep for a 2x a day moisturizer
i will continue to use nourish as my summer moisturizer
most ppl see this as a very basic moisturizer
felt i needed a lightweight moisturizer
with any other moisturizer i have used i couldn't moisturize am
i feel this moisturizer does a really great job after cleanser at night
i love this moisturizer.
ks moisturizer is helping my skin feel
alot of moisturizers i tried using always broke me out
this moisturizer is perfect for sensitive skin.
i just keep purchasing this moisturizer for my "normal" skin
very good moisturizer for my sensitive combination skin
i love this moisturizer
the light fragrance always makes me feel like i'm pampering myself
am stick with kate's moisturizers after trying many of the dr's
this is the most expensive moisturizer i have ever bought
i get dry patches- this moisturizer stays matte on my face all day
this is a really great moisturizer.
this kate somerville moisturizer is simply the best
the most perfect facial light weight moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer.
it works great right before putting on my tinted moisturizer
a lot of daily moisturizers just haven't cut it
needed something stronger than the oil-free moisturizer
even under the goat's milk moisturizer
this is a really nice moisturizer
i tried all the kate moisturizers
it's a nice balanced moisturizer for combo
this is my go to lotion when i get dry
this is a really nice skin cream.
this is truely the perfect moisturizer for me
this moisturizer does enough to balance out my skin tone
other moisturizers feel heavy.
decided to try the nourish daily moisturizer
her oil free moisturizer during the day
this is the best moisturizer yet
its a nice moisturizer that doesn't seem to irritate my skin
this moisturizer is very good if you like a lightweight moisturizer
i recommend korress yogurt moisturizer
cannot live without nourish daily moisturizer!!
this moisturizer is one of the best i have tried in my life
not like a cream or a gel
kate somerville's oil free moisturizer during the day
settled for the oil free moisturizer- which i love
decided to give this moisturizer another try
this is a nice moisturizer for every season
i am very happy with this moisturizer
this is a perfect day time moisturizer that is lightweight
this moisturizer is truly the best moisturizer i've tried
it is a nice light moisturizer.
i especially like this moisturizer better than the others in the product line
skincare i hold close to my heart
the moisturizer that i've been searching for my whole life
doesn't sit ontop of the skin like alot of moisturizers do
s of dollars worth of creams
this has been the single best moisturizer that i have ever used
this was just too much moisturizer for me
this is a wonderful daily moisturizer.
it gives you the perfect amount of moisturizer for one use
i now only use concealer under my eyes
i cannot wait to never buy foundation or concealer ever again
the whole skincare line is amazing
i follow with clatins moisturizer
best moisturizer i have had in a while.
will not switch to another moisturizer
just bought the nourish moisturizer!
not followed up with moisturizer
i also love her oil free moisturizer .
i don't require a gallon of greasy moisturizer
the amazing eye cream
oil free moisturizer does the great job to keep skin hyrdated
the first pillow with oil-free sensitive skin lotion
i also follow up this cleanser with kate somerville nourish moisturizer
i've moved on to a different moisturizer now
that's nothing a moisturizer cannot fix :
no moisturizing in any way do you definitely need an oil free moisturizer as well
along with her oil free moisturizer my skin is looking glowy
i also love the spf lotion.
it is 100% worth the $78 for this moisturizer
love this moisturizer especially with the harsh winter drying out my skin
the water light spf 50 sunscreen
i decided to invest in skincare
this is my favorite moisturizer because i break out very easily with certain moisturizers
this moisturizer is great for normal
it's a great daily face moisturizer
this is by far the best moisturizer i have tried.
i got a sample of this moisturizer from a sephora employee that tested how moisturized my skin is
this moisturizer has transformed my skin significantly
this moisturizer keeps my oil at bay
it is a nice light weight moisturizer
i love this moisturizer because it is oil free
even other kate somerville moisturizers
i even like wearing moisturizer alone for a no makeup day
this moisturizer is light weight
this moisturizer is amazing under makeup
i know this moisturizer is on the pricey side
it is the lightest lotion i've ever tried.
just a light everyday moisturizer
it also doesn't make sense that for an acne lotion
there's no slippery film as gel moisturizers tend to leave
lost a star for not having any sunscreen.
this is my favorite every day moisturizer.
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
this light weight moisturizer is amazing as a base under your makeup
oil-free moisturizer that helps to keep my acne-prone skin in check
this is something my combination skin is not used to in an acne moisturizer
this moisturizer works great in the areas i am very oily
if you've been giving this moisturizer some thought
i feel like i need additional moisturizer for my cheeks
i love this lotion.
goes great to layer over top her serums.
i love this moisturizer
only moisturizer that doesn't create pimples on my oily skin
i tried to find a similar moisturizer
this moisturizer does what it says it does!
it dispenses the moisturizer
its a light weight moisturizer
this moisturizer is great for girls with oily
so this moisturizer feels a bit heavy
this is an excellent lightweight moisturizer.
with this lightweight moisturizer i don't feel greasy
i now have a new appreciation for cream moisturizers
it's a great moisturizer before make up.
i love that i've found a moisturizer that doesn't make me feel sticky
i believe this moisturizer is great for combination
t's been a little difficult to find the right moisturizer for my skin
i am so excited to find a moisturizer that is oil free
this moisturizer is fragrance free
it's my perfect moisturizer
i am in love with this moisturizer!
not only does it moisturizer my skin
this is truly the only moisturizer that has worked for me
always struggled finding a good moisturizer
this is the first moisturizer i have used that is oil free
i really prefer an oil-free moisturizer for my combinational skin
shouldn't be using such a thick moisturizer
got a new skincare regimen
this moisturizer doesn't feel all heavy greasy
this moisturizer is strictly for combination to oily skin types
i love love one this moisturizer
other than that this moisturizer is my go to!
i've tried the whole spectrum for moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used!
this is my favorite moisturizer i've ever used.
which is hard to shop for when it comes to moisturizer
i love this moisturizer so much that this is my second review of the product
i only use this moisturizer in the winter
this moisturizer has really improved the texture of my skin
i reaaalllyyyyy love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is amazing for oily skin!
i got this moisturizer as a sample
the moisturizer didn't feel heavy
f you want a more matte moisturizer this probably isn't for you
i did not realize how much i needed to change my moisturizer until i forced to when korres discontinued their pomegranate gel moisturizer
this is actually the best moisturizer i've ever used for my skin
not irritate skin that i had honestly stopped using moisturizer during the day
"what kind of moisturizer do you use?"
i still need to use moisturizer
this moisturizer is great
this moisturizer should immediately migrate to you bathroom shelf
back to the moisturizer---smooth
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer saved me.
started using korres night facial with this moisturizer
this moisturizer i'm hooked to kate sumerville line
my first impression is i highly enjoyed this moisturizer
shiseido wrinkle resist night creme
this moisturizer is great
have had a hard time finding a moisturizer that helps minimize fine lines
this moisturizer is fantastic.
this is my holy grail moisturizer.
this oil free moisturizer is perfect
this lotion has saved my skin.
followed by a gel moisturizer
i've bought this expensive lotion three times
then this before my moisturizer
this lotion has completely changed my skin!
only use at night under a serum or moisturizer
make sure you put some kind of moisturizer or serum on top
i put this underneath my moisturizer at night.
i typically don't use moisturizers as they leave a really tacky
hours later my skin is still matte
before my actually moisturizer
night cream after applying the lotion
this lotion is the best thing i've ever put on my skin
5% lotion for daytime prevention
this 5% lotion does the trick
i recommend a light moisturizer over it once it has had time to set in
have to apply a heavy moisturizer over it
recommend a nice moisturizer with it
i do recommend using a lightweight lotion after applying though
nothing a moisturizer can't fix
make sure you have a great moisturizer to replenish after using this product
i've just started using say yes to carrots intense hydration night cream
it's also the perfect moisturizer for my oily/combo skin
does not pill when layering
this lotion helped clear up my acne
btw: i don't use this as a moisturizer as it is too drying
nothing works like this lotion
you always need a layer of benzoyl peroxide on your face in order to keep acne at bay :
this lotion is amazing
i hardly have the need for any concealer
best moisturizer i have found
don't forget to use a moisturizer after this product
i always follow it with a moisturizer
is not meant to replace your moisturizer
this lotion is verrrry light
day/night creams on top of it
apply more heavy-duty moisturizers with it
but this lotion is amazing.
then apply my daily moisturizer on top
i made the mistake of using this product without moisturizer
with the application of moisturizer afterwards
i apply the lotion every night after my retinol treatment
this lotion does exactly what the advertisement says
this lotion is a miracle!!!
oil-free moisturizer as well
this lotion is preventative
i apply a heavy moisturizer on top
you need to use with a moisturizer
i absolutely am in love with this lotion
nothing a good moisturizer can help
i would put two pumps of the lotion
this cream is more like a lotion.
i tried this lotion
i love this face lotion
coupled with the oil-free moisturizer
recommend a light moisturizer with it
i apply my eye cream
don't forget to wear sunscreen the next day
top with a rich moisturizer after letting it soak in
my current go-to moisturizer
i love using this moisturizer when my skin is irritated
i really love this lotion
love this as a daytime moisturizer.
this is the only moisturizer that works with my skin
no breakouts which every moisturizer breaks me out which is awesome
even though i have stopped taking the medication i still use this moisturizer
i tried a couple other moisturizers that ruined my skin
this moisturizer is the perfect addition
it is so moisturizing you barely need any to cover the face
the only moisturizer i will use, my holy grail.
i must say i am in love with this moisturizer!
i like tinted moisturizer in summer
this moisturizer is a dream!
love this as a day cream.
putting this moisturizer on everyday
which i use it on before applying eye gel or cream
it's hard to find a moisturizer that doesn't add to that oiliness throughout the day
this moisturizer works wonders!
non-irritating, non-shiny moisturizer.
non-greasy moisturizer for day/nighttime
i like this moisturizer because it absorbs quickly
this moisturizer is suitable for all of those skin types that i go through
my foundation applies really nicely on top of this moisturizer
non-greasy moisturizer that works decently
would consider this to be a morning moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
i've tried a lot of high end moisturizers
it is a great day and night moisturizer.
has broken out from heavier moisturizing creams in the past
i love this cream!
it's been the best moisturizer i've tried in a while
i really liked this moisturizer.
it's a great moisturizer for for
this moisturizer is everything i've ever wanted.
followed up with the moisturizer
i am very picky when it comes to moisturizers
this moisturizer does not mess up with it
this moisturizer feels amazing.
it acted as a great moisturizer
my skin was less greasy by the end of the day than it is with other moisturizers
she put this moisturizer on my face before applying the foundation
my usual moisturizer is kate somerville's "oil-free" moisturizer
this moisturizer is so light
i began using this moisturizer
the rep recommended it when i told her i'm having a hard time find a moisturizer for my oily skin that works well in combination with my spf
this moisturizer works wonders for my skin in the morning
it's a light lotion consistency not a heavy cream moisturizer
wear well under sunscreen
unlike a lot of moisturizers this doesn't feel heavy
this is my new favorite face cream.
this is my new winter cream.
it has truly helped my face stay moisturizer
this moisturizer is amazing.
the very best all-purpose moisturizer out there
this is a lovely light but effective moisturizer.
one of the best moisturizers i have tried.
for me the holy grail of moisturizers.
this goes beyond a basic moisturizer
i usually have to put moisturizers on by the pound
this moisturizer is great for dry skin.
such a super clean moisturizer!
literally the best moisturizer i've ever used.
i really like this cream.
it isn't thick like other moisturizers out there.
doesn't feel heavy yet this moisturizes your face like many heavy duty facial creams without the greasy looking feel to it
s down the best moisturizer i've ever used
i really love this moisturizer.
barely need moisturizer your face is so soft
this cream has saved my skin.
the cream is a little expensive
i frequently skip my moisturizer when i use this multitasking product
women want to know if i had a peel or had a professional exfoliation
this cream felt great on application
paying for this lotion for a long time
this is one of the best moisturizers i've ever tried
don't need a special daytime moisturizer
i absolutely love kate's oil free moisturizer
this is a really good moisturizer!
to me, 150 is a crazy price for a facial cream.
this is a wonderful moisturizer which helped sooth my aging
i think that this really is an excellent anti -aging moisturizer every time i use this my skin is glowing
finally, i have found my moisturizer!
the regular moisturizer during the day
this is a nice eye cream.
this cream was a miracle for my eyes.
this eye cream is amazing!
my skincare routine didnt change except this eye cream
i love this eye cream.
is great under concealer
love this eye cream!
keeps concealer products from looking dry or crepey
i can get botox
it is flawless under concealer
it is not a miracle cream
this is one of the best eye creams i've used
this is a pricey eye cream but it works.
this moisturizer has been great for me.
it makes your skin so smooth you might not need moisturizer
i apply just this without any other moisturizer
wait 5 minutes then apply lotion & makeup.
regardless of how much i spend on creams
i apply this nightly underneath my kate somerville nourish daily moisturizer
moisturizer without any irritation
i applied it every morning after my moisturizer
i don't even need my facial moisturizer anymore
can go directly to sunscreen or foundation primer
this is the best one so far in terms of moisturizing
i don't even need the extra moisturizer i usually apply before sunscreen
i would put this on under my moisturizer
it was great to give my moisturizer
then you follow with the kate somerville nourish daily moisturizer
i forgo using moisturizer
i've always spent good money on my skincare
it does provide a mositurizing base for moisturizer
use the whole product line or use another moisturizer
just use the oil-free moisturizer
it helps any moisturizer i put on after it work even better
it is a great moisturizer for any skin type.
i apply cream on top
that i needed to use moisturizer less often
it sinks right in to your skin then i usually add a moisturizer after
love this product because it prepares my skin for any moisturizer
if it was more of a creme
really like to moisturize at night like most of us
usually a heavy duty moisturizer will cause breakouts
a half pump mixed with my kate oil free moisturizer
in my skin-care regimen
having ttried many expensive moisturizers
this is truly the best facial moisturizer for dry skin
let it soak in for a minute or two before applying moisturizer
this is the best facial moisturizer.
you can use your own moisturizing product over it
sometimes i mix it in with my nourish moisturizer
only use this at night under my deep tissue moisturizer
polished even before moisturizer
i continue it with my other skincare regimen
tend to layer my serums
if i used water proof eyeliner
scent, you feel like you are pampering yourself.
this paired with first aid beauty moisturizer is perfect
i recommend to use the gel moisturizer as well.
benefit they're real mascara
sunscreen at the end of the day
moisturizer work so good
run over eyes to remove my gel mascara
that is allergic to sunscreen
it removes my mascara and eyeliner easily.
does not sting my eyes when i remove my waterproof mascara
i only wear waterproof mascara
including my waterproof mascara
i always use bioderma crealine to remove my eye make-up since i use waterproof mascara on my bottom lashes
even the water proof mascara
the hydrating cream is the best (but i digress).
your skin needs vitamins like you're body need exercise
i can go without moisturizer
i don't because they also make the best moisturizer ever
this moisturizer is simply amazing!!
i've never experienced a moisturizer like this.
this moisturizer helped me a lot after using retin-a
i love this moisturizer.
i alternate this with my tatcha water cream for my daytime moisturizer

i've tried mostly every moisturizer out there
this moisturizer doesn't leave my skin too oily
i can even use it as day time moisturizer.
this is the perfect morning moisturizer.
to make a tinted moisturizer- other creams/gels i've tried make it break up
this is the only moisturizer i've ever used that truly balances
best face cream ever and is oil free!
this gel is so light
the one problem i had was that my sunscreen would pill
this is the best moisturizer ever!
this is the best moisturizer i've ever tried
the first moisturizer to balance my oily complexion
though this moisturizer is on the pricer side
i really like this moisturizer because i have oily skin
i tried to replaced it as you known this moisturizer is really expensive
no moisturizer can bring to me the same experiences
the tinted treatment moisturizer
i am in love with this moisturizer.
this is by far the best moisturizer i've tried.
i am beyond obsessed with this moisturizer.
i've tried other moisturizers to get away from the high price tag
this moisturizer is perfect for what i need
my first purchase was the amore tinted moisturizer
i recently tried this moisturizer
i also use their tinted moisturizer.
e it to my ritual of using this moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
it's the only moisturizer that i can wear during the summer
this is a great moisturizer for oily/combo skin!
the creme one in the winter
i've found most moisturizers to be too greasy or heavy
this is a really good moisturizer.
this moisturizer is the best.
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is perfect

excellent moisturizer..does not make my skin oily

i love this oil free moisturizer!
this moisturizer definitely delivers
this moisturizer is pure heaven.
i absolutely love the smell of this moisturizer
this was the lightest moisturizer i've ever used
this is by far my favorite moisturizer.
under a combo tinted moisturizer foundation that always leaves me feeling greasy
this moisturizer is perfect in the spring/summer -- it's lightweight
with an eye cream
girl who does my facials says my skin just keeps looking better
some people need heavier creams.
i love this moisturizer
i did however find it perfect to use under tinted moisturizers
i would put a little more of this moisturizer on that part of my face
watery gel moisturizer to replace the one i had been using
has a nice gel-weight cream
this gel-moisturizer is amazing.
using this as my regular nightly moisturizer because i tend to use a lot of moisturizer at night
this moisturizer feels great on
this product is not a moisturizer in my opinion
follow by my moisturizer
so do make sure to apply moisturizer after giving a few minutes for the serum to absorb
then apply murad vitamin c step 3 moisturizer on top of it
top it with powerful moisturizer with sunscreen
this is one of the best serums out there!
i also buy the latest anti-aging serums for nighttime use along with a vitamin a/retinol moisturizer
the package says wait one minute before applying moisturizer
essential-c moisturizer are a great duo
i forgot to put my regular moisturizer over it once
this is more like a booster for your creams that gives you bright
it is meant to be used before your moisturizer.
this lotion is nice
put in some bronzer
i find that i use a little less moisturizer
want to try the other murad moisturizers
before i put on moisturizer
as directed put my moisturizer over it
now i go every other night with a retinol.
c creams), but did the job.
moisturizes with the jack black double duty moisturizer
t pore refiner as the moisturizer as part of my bedtime regimen
i always have to use a moisturizer
lotion from a previous purchase
i keep up with my beauty regimens
used it along with the matte lotion from this line
i've found that goes away once i use my moisturizer
you may want to alternate with a light moisturizer also
the spf moisturizer during the day
i just love love this serums
i follow up with concealer by ole henrikson which has a built in spf
instead of the spf concealer i use a rich eye moisturizer
with a cream on top
it is a liquid formula that you pat around the eye it really helps for puffiness
before my eye cream
wrinkles as my concealer goes on better
i don't wear concealer anymore
you need a good moisturizer with it
skincare takes time to work for sure.
i switch my products around while still searching for the perfect moisturizer
i apply the face finishing moisturizer afterwards
followed by my chanel moisturizer
using only one pump under an oil-free moisturizer worked quite well
face finishing moisturizer from perricone
wait for that to dry prior to putting on moisturizer
use this product every evening as a moisturizer
in combination to my moisturizer
so you need retinol
this moisturizer may just be my favorite of them all
i do use bosia nighttime moisturizer on top of it
with all the ingredients you want in a skin cream
the face finishing moisturizer
it's a really nice treatment lotion
this is the best night cream for dry skin
its not a moisturizer people
its a serum for under your moisturizer
one of my favorite perricone products that has shown the most improvement on my skin is the “neuropeptide firming moisturizer
so make sure you moisturize after you use this
any good moisturizer will easily fix that
they wouldn't go away after exfoliating
i make sure to use a good moisturizer afterwards
i always have to apply an oil free moisturizer because my skin feels dry
ive tried more moisturizers than most
i love this cream.
more this is the absolute perfect moisturizer for me
the matching eye cream
this is one of my top moisturizers
this is the most amazing moisturizer i have ever used
she also loves this moisturizer
this really is"the creme".
what an impressive moisturizer
hands down the best moisturizer on the market!!!
it's an amazing moisturizer
this cream is expensive
this cream definitely feels like i am pampering myself when i use it
use the nighttime moisturizer
my second favorite moisturizer of all time.
i love this cream
just using this cream without any essence or serum or lotion for a week made my face skin so bright
i usually just use coconut oil as a moisturizer.
my previous moisturizers were very good
i wear this cream both under my liquid foundation
this moisturizer is so good.
i do a lot of research before i buy my skincare
i got a sample of this cream with my purchase of the eye cream
just this summer decided to try this lotion vs the heavier cream for the hot season
i also take a pump of this cream
mix it with laura mercier tinted moisturizer for the perfect summer coverage
this cream works well.
it's hard to find a good anti-aging night creme for combination skin
one of the best moisturizers i have tried!
this lovely aging process has now required me to use a quality moisturizer
started using this cream
at first it seemed to just be a good moisturizer
however i was in desperate need of a great moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer that i have every used
this is the best moisturizer that i have tried
the one perfect cream
this cream is amazing.
it is my new favorite face cream.
i find the cru eye cream works wonders for puffiness
this is by far the best face moisturizer that i have ever used
i love this cream.
does this cream have sunscreen?
this cream was a real splurge for me.
i intended for it to be all over night face moisturizer
she told me that i don't need to use separate moisturizer with it
$155 is quite a bit to spend on a moisturizer
do typically add my spf moisturizer for the day after this has set in
has sunscreen in it
on top the cream
or moisturizer for best results
it also is a serum and moisturizer in one.
great product, i needed this cream.
this creme is so nice to my skin
i do use a little less in the morning since i mix my moisturizer with a very strong sunblock
s' night cream/creme before
doing whatever else i choose to get my skin prepped at night for moisturizing
meaning i do not need an extra serum or target treatment because this product delivers all the moisturizing
for me it smells like an unscented moisturizer.
when i place my moisturizer over cold plasma
then add my moisturizer
not enough that i would skip my moisturizer
it is not meant to be used in place of your moisturizer
then again good skincare doesn't need to in order to work
if you couple it with his moisturizer
then put on a moisturizer
then i follow with an oil free moisturizer
i needed to use only a little bit of product under my moisturizer
especially the finishing moisturizer
i most likely will need to use a moisturizer on top of this treatment
money on my regimen
night under my moisturizer
i never used to use sunscreen
a lightweight moisturizer that sits nicely under makeup
i like this moisturizer
i used this years ago as a daily moisturizer.
i recommend using this as a daily moisturizer
years later this is still the only moisturizer i use
this moisturizer is perfect.
i love this day time moisturizer for the simple fact that it absorbs quickly
i absolutely love this moisturizer
so i tried this moisturizer and i just love it!
been using this product as my daily moisturizer for 5 years now
was pretty good about sunscreen
concealer under my eyes
this is a great moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i have found!
normally i would break out from an spf in my moisturizer
this moisturizer is different
it is a great moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer makes my skin look great!
i pair this with my clinique moisturizer
it smells like sunblock
i did enjoy this moisturizer
it is a sunscreen as well
my new favorite moisturizer!
great moisturizer not heavy, goes in smooth.
this moisturizer has done wonders for my skin!
i love this moisturizer!!!
as soon as i started applying clinique even better moisturizer again my breakouts started fading
my favorite is philosophy's moisturizer.
this is a great moisturizer.
would like a moisturizer that gives me a dewey look
i love this face lotion.
it is also just a great over all moisturizer
7oz jar of this lotion usually lasts me about 2 months anyways
i like this moisturizer due to its not oily
usually i have to change moisturizers in the winter to avoid "chicago winter skin
i love this cream.
simply for the wonderful moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
i find this moisturizer really does even me out
it's a light moisturizer- i still need an extra moisturizer for my dry/combo skin
this moisturizer is perfect
with the clinque even better moisturizer
i just purchased the even better moisturizer
typically my skin goes crazy whenever i don't have my usual skincare regimen with me
could use it for my daytime lotion instead of having to pile on multiple creams
i love this moisturizer!
i really like this moisturizer
while i loved the feel of it as a moisturizer
i believe that this product is a great daily moisturizer for women who have dry to normal skin
can't you tell that i can't get enough of clinique moisturizers
this moisturizer has done wonders for my skin!
this moisturizer is very light
once i added the moisturizer i achieved even better results
this moisturizer is perfect for the super dry parts of my face
this moisturizer does the trick.
contains sunscreen which i love
expensively priced moisturizers promising everything under the sun
this spf moisturizer works great for my skin :)!
this cream definitely even your skin
've started using it in place of my other moisturizer
it's not too shiny like regular sunscreen
this is an excellent moisturizer.
this is my moisturizer of choice for the fall
i really like this cream
i love this skin cream!!
i love this lotion!
this moisturizer uses chemical blockers so does not have those problems
i 'd use this lotion for almost 2 years
feels like a rich moisturizer
my dermatologist stressed to me the importance of wearing a daily moisturizer with spf
it is a good moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer!
it has spf which most moisturizers don't.
i don't mind the sunscreen
overall this is a very good everyday moisturizer
i love this cream because it is a moisturizer as well as a sunscreen
i've used this moisturizer for almost two years
my only issues with this lotion is that the spf prevents me using it at night
this moisturizer is wonderful.
this is the only moisturizer my super dry very sensitive skin likes that contains an spf
this moisturizer works well to lighten problem areas
i like that it has sunscreen in it.
i love this eye cream
this is a great cream.
this eye cream is the best i've ever used.
always come back to lancôme's eye creams
one of the best eye creams i have tried in my life
this is the best eye cream.
her eye creams just weren't doing it for me
this eye cream is one of the best eye cream i have ever used
plus, it helps my concealer last longer.
using my ever-day face cream
i prefer a heavier cream
keeps the undereye moist enough to dab concealer on
it helps keep said concealer in place throughout the day
1 year of using no moisturizer
not my eye cream
i don't mind spending the money for a really good skincare item
the best eye cream i have ever used.
concealer sits perfectly on top of genifique eye concentrate
this is -the- best cream i have ever used for my undereye area
i've always been using concealer under my eyes to cover up the darkness
to the point that sometimes i forget to use a concealer
this eye cream is perfect
also works really well with concealer
drug store products i decided to just focus on concealer to cover them up
it's my favorite eye cream
it is meant to go under your moisturizer or eye cream
i apply a small amount of whatever moisturizing eye cream i'm usuing
it's not advertised as a moisturizer
it is a gel-like creme, and applies well.
this is my go-to eye creme!
this eye creme has sort of a creme-gel consistency
i havn't found a concealer that covers them without caking
i still use a little concealer under my eyes
the cream has also reduced the little lines that the concealer brings out
moisturizer not having a clue of where to start
i feel like most cleansers are too harsh for my skin so this was perfect followed by the moisturizer
moisturizer your skin will clear up in no time
its soooo great it removes my waterproof mascara
i even use the moisturizer that goes with it some of the time
this cleanser in combination with my moisturizer is perfect
this moisturizer is wonderful.
i recommend using it with the face moisturizer as well
follow with the moisturizer
though i'd recommend using a moisturizer afterwards anyway
i've used it paired with the fab moisturizer
do recommend using a moisturizer after using this
it makes my concealer sit like a dream because it plumps my undereyes
i allow it to dry for about 10-15 minutes before applying concealer
i love the face cream so much i tried the eye cream
i put it on before lotion or primer
i wish it was more of a gel formula
most eye creams cause even my waterproof mascara
i def normally need to put a little concealer around my them
great moisturizer it has repaired my skin beyond belief
this moisturizer works incredibly well
this is my go to moisturizer
i am obsessed with this moisturizer.
when i use a different moisturizer
plus it's a lot less than the moisturizers i was using before
i ran out of my moisturizer
this cream has done miracles for my skin.
which was making my concealer/foundation grab
this moisturizer is perfect if you're on a budget
this is now my holy grail moisturizer!
i don't use it as a moisturizer on my face
i still layer my serums morning
the best cream ever!!
when all of your other moisturizers aren't helping
this is my new go-to body cream.
i love this cream.
even just for a nighttime moisturizer
this moisturizer is a game changer
a lighter weight moisturizer in the morning
make sure yo moisturizer at night
this is the best moisturizer cream anyone will ever need
i recently ran out of the face moisturizer i use
it is the best face moisturizer i have ever used!
my holy grail moisturizer.
it is also one of the best moisturizers i have ever used
have always used cerave as a moisturizer
was skeptical as to whether i would like the moisturizer
i've tried so many different moisturizers for my face
this moisturizer is perfect for it
this is the cream for you
this is the most amazing moisturizer i have used.
my only complaint is i don't normally like cream moisturizers
this is the best moisturizer i have found for keeping my h
this is the only moisturizer that keeps my skin moisturizer while not breaking me out
this is a really great moisturizer!
if you like cream moisturizers or need something that packs a punch
this is a good lotion to use to help keep that under control
this my "go-to" moisturizer because it really does help dry
it is the best moisturizer i've ever used
this moisturizer is a skin-saver
it works great as a body moisturizer, as well.
this is my new fav moisturizer.
i needed a moisturizer that could help balance my skin needs
this is the perfect moisturizer for all.
my gel moisturizers are not enough to keep my face from feeling tight/dry
and i'm still loving this moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used.
this is a great moisturizer for sensitive
i've tried almost every moisturizer
i will start by saying that this cream is too thick for me to use as a face moisturizer
my favorite lotion ever.
i love this lotion.
this lotion has been the best ever!
this cream is the best moisturizer ever
this moisturizer feels heavy when you first apply it
i love this cream
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
the moisturizers my dermatologist recommended weren't really working for me
would try to cover up with concealer
finally "seal" everything in with this lotion
i've kissed my prescription creams good bye--
literally the best moisturizer i've ever purchased
i used it everyday as a facial moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
this is my go-to moisturizer
it is not super thick like other intense moisturizers
it has gone away i love this moisturizer
let me tell you i've used a couple of moisturizers from sephora
for the price you have to pick up this moisturizer
it's amazing as a normal everyday moisturizer.
i may try fab's spf moisturizer for daytime since i love this one so much
i will be using this moisturizer for life!
applied the moisturizer right after
this is the only moisturizer my sensitive skin can h
i need a really good moisturizer
i tried high end moisturizers that did literally nothing
best moisturizer hands down
cream in the winter
s to pat some onto my cheeks if my daytime moisturizer isn't cutting it
this cream works it wonders
buy this cream helps everything!
the 6oz tub will last me a long time if i use it more for spot treatment than an all-over moisturizer
i originally went to purchase the josei maran moisturizer
absolutely adore this lotion
this is a miracle cream
i think this does a job of a moisturizer
water based moisturizer for sure
normally had to use fair amount of concealer to deal with that
i rarely have to use concealer now
i love how it looks under tinted moisturizer in particular
can skip moisturizer when wearing foundation with it
yes, it's more like a lotion than a serum.
then i need to put on another moisturizer on top
use before moisturizer to lock in moisture all day
i still use this in conjunction with moisturizer to combat my dry skin
i am new to serums, but i really like this one!
the lady at sephora told me to use this in conjunction with the fab facial moisturizer
i can get away with wearing just a tinted moisturizer now
when i put this on before my actual moisturizer
the lotion is way thicker than i was expecting
i would call it more of a lotion
it is a moisturizer as well
i would layer it with another moisturizer for extra moisture
under a heavier moisturizer in the pm
was advised to get in the retinol game
i told them it's this retinol for sure!
i follow that with my serum and then moisturizer.
i kept slathering on different moisturizers
some weeks i use only a moisturizer
i really find that using a good moisturizer
you need to be careful with any retinol product
only when i'm lazy to follow my daily skin regimen
this is my first go with retinol i think this is a good starter retinol
i will say you still need a moisturizer with this
during the day i only wear sunscreen lotion
i don't feel that i need to add a moisturizer with it
very lightweight, i apply a moisturizer after.
just remember to use sunscreen during the day!
the retinol in this stuff is amazing!
just mix with a little moisturizer.
i follow with moisturizer
in the summer i can actually use just the retinol fusion in lieu of moisturizer
in denver it dry so moisturizer is a must!
i combine a drop of this serum with my nightly moisturizer all over my face
this is good skin in a bottle!
it is the only retinol product that i am able to use
at times i need a moisturizer with it.
this is my favorite retinol product.
sunscreen during the day are a must
it is not a moisturizing as you would think on its own
after doing a lot of research on retinol
i wanted to get some strong retinol
this is my first retinol ever
wear sunscreen every day
anti wrinkle creams with some success
since i wear an spf 55+ sunscreen 365 days a year
provides a fantastic base for my moisturizer
moisturizer in the morning
other supposed skin wonder creams
every other night to get my skin used to the retinol
put on my shiseido ibuki refining moisturizer
i don't even have to use moisturizer afterward
i follow with the moisturizer
then follow up with a moisturizer.
then follow by moisturizer
moisturize well afterwards will be a big help
although i still use moisturizer just in case
it officially replaced my typical moisturizer.
i wear an spf 55 sunscreen during the day
this evened out my skin tone to the point where i no longer use concealer
i only wear waterproof eyeliner
this removes everything from waterproof mascara to full coverage foundation
sunscreen after swimming or outside activity
i wear about 3 or 4 layers of water proof mascara
it removes my shiseido ultimate sunscreen
shiseido ultimate sun protection cream spf 50
i don't use a lot of makeup -- just the sunscreen
i wear sunscreen on a daily basis
found that i would still have eyeliner or mascara residue left
sunscreen like nothing else i've used
it removes foundation and sunscreen very easily.
it definitely removes heavy sunscreen products.
it will remove waterproof make-up and sunscreen.
the sunscreen is completely off my face clean
a different moisturizer at night
this is the only moisturizer i have ever used that is not greasy
this is my every day morning lotion for my face.
i supplement with a sunscreen
have found it to be lightweight enough to be used under sunscreen
the cream is working well for normal to oily skin
slightly less effective if i layer sunscreen over it
a different sunscreen might affect this
most mattifying lotions i've tried use a silicone-like substance to reduce shine which left my face feeling greasier than it already is
if i fell in love i would be spending this much on moisturizer with no spf
this is a great moisturizer that absorbs quickly
have to say this lotion has impressed
the mattifying lotion were enough to make my skin look not just clearer
shine at bay by using this product on top of my clarins brightening spf lotion
i get more of a matte finish with cosmedicine medimatte lotion
love the feel of the lotion
only lotion i will from here on out
usually lotions will bring on zits to my t-zone-this is worth every penny plus
i' always careful with sleecting a good moisturizer
this lotion was exactly what i needed for my combination skin
best moisturizer i have used.
it's like a primer/moisturizer.
so all i can say is that the pores no more anti-aging mattifying lotion is fabulous
this is probably the best moisturizer i have ever used
i love this moisturizer!
i prefer mattifying moisturizer
i noticed that when i used a mattifying moisturizer
decided to return this moisturizer
go back to my regular moisturizer
i follow up with a spf moisturizer
i follow up with another moisturizer
i think it is mattifying
mattifying at the same time
you need a gloppy moisturizer
i definitely noticed that mattifying effects of this lotion
oil-free moisturizers that did nothing for my fine lines
this lotion has a mattifying effect when i first apply
however, this lotion is great!
this moisturizer is by far the best one i have ever used
this is a great lite moisturizer that keeps most of the shine away
i still use a primer after applying this moisturizer
it is very difficult to find a moisturizer that addresses aging
this lotion is great
it's really hard to find a good moisturizer.
which is usually the problem for me on other moisturizers
i love this cream!
i love this moisturizer.
it seems like a combo moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer there is!
this is by far the best moisturizer i have ever used
this moisturizer really helps to minimize those lines
best moisturizer i have found yet.
the biggest difference really is that with my old daytime moisturizer
most moisturizers tend to make me break out
the moisturizer is light
this is by far my favorite moisturizer
this is my go-to moisturizer in the fall
i've tried so many moisturizers that say that they improve your skin
i needed a really good moisturizer
after using this moisturizer for 2 weeks the lines are less pronounced
this is the first cream
as i'm aging, i'm trying out new moisturizers
this is such a great moisturizer.
this moisturizer feels great
i still use my original moisturizer during the day
i like this moisturizer.
i also use it under my eyes for smoother concealer application
will not be without this awesome moisturizer.
best moisturizer i have ever used.
had resigned myself to using a moisturizer that didn't break out or irritate my skin
even the other philosophy moisturizers
i absolutely can't live without this moisturizer!
this is my favorite moisturizer
this moisturizer is the one i always come back to
this moisturizer rocks-- it's expensive
told me about this moisturizer
this cream is amazing!
'm a bit hesitant to use this as my daily moisturizer
my face is a little red for a while after applying this moisturizer
i like the weight of this moisturizer as my skin can be a little dry
this is the best moisturizer ever!
the only moisturizer i put on my face.
great night time moisturizer.
this does make an excellent nighttime moisturizer
all in all, the best moisturizer i've ever used.
i need more from my moisturizer
feel refreshed/brighter from using this moisturizer
i only use this moisturizer at night.
i finally found moisturizer that works for my face
it is a heavy night cream
recently started using the miracle worker moisturizer
i typically use this moisturizer at night
the non-oily moisturizers just aren't doing the job any longer
i love the feel of this moisturizer.
this cream is fantasic!
best moisturizer i've ever tried
during the day i wear it under my spf tinted moisturizer
love the feel and benefits from this moisturizer.
s down the best moisturizer i've ever used
anti-aging moisturizer i've ever used
it is a hard working moisturizer
i love the texture of this moisturizer
this is a great nighttime moisturizer!!
eye moisturizer in this br
even that stubborn waterproof mascara
making my nighty skincare routine simple
i just wear eyeshadow
some stubborn waterproof mascara
eyeshadow that had primer
does nothing against my mascara
it also did wonders for taking off my mascara
waterproof mascara that this removes with just one pump
it gets through tough lipsticks
takes off everything, even my waterproof mascara.
no more eyelashes falling out when i remove my mascara
mascara while leaving my face soft
this successfully takes all mascara
it was really good with waterproof mascara
it's okay when i put my moisturizer on
for those days i didnt want to wash face especially for my beeswax ingredient mascara
the most difficult of lipsticks are no match to this
yet removes even my heavy duty waterproof mascara
now my eyeshadow lasts all day.
it gets off my mascara
use boscia's cool oil as my moisturizer
then do an exfoliating the next morning
i love the better than sex mascara
additional moisturizers would make my skin feel gross or add to the acne
also this cleanser makes your skin really dry so dont forget to moisturize
then no matter what my skincare routine was
i follow up with murad's skin perfecting lotion.
has a sort of gel-cream like consistency
had to add a stronger moisturizer to my regime
disclaimer: i also use the murad anti-aging acne moisturizer
now i hardly need concealer.
i am currently using it in combination with the skin perfecting lotion so here's hoping for results
followed by an algenist moisturizer
i still like to tan
then i add clinique dramatically different moisturing gel or lotion
this is the only moisturizer that will not break me out
perhaps a stronger spf lotion is called for with this product
i really like this cream
it's perfect before my regular moisturizer.
i can't believe i spent that much on a skin cream
i just threw on a little concealer under my eyes
a good spf moisturizer has almost made my wrinkles disappear
it's a really good moisturizer.
to use a moisturizer on his face
he liked the ultra repair moisturizer
this is a nice simple face cream.
this moisturizer is lightweight
this is a great basic light weight daily moisturizer
this is one of the best moisturizers i've ever purchased
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used.
it needs to be moisturizer after washing
i wish i could give this moisturizer 100 stars.
5 times expensive than this fab moisturizer
the only moisturizer that doesn't make my face oily
i love this simple moisturizer.
i decided to try this moisturizer after seeing it on youtube
i tried this moisturizer after seeing it mentioned in a makeup tutorial by a celebrity makeup artist
its a great summer night moisturizer!
this is my favourite daily moisturizer.
this is my everyday moisturizer.
this moisturizer hasn't failed me
since it's more expensive than the last daily moisturizer i used
it is a great daily moisturizer.
this moisturizer doesn't make me more oily

i love this cream!!

i've incorporated the fab moisturizer product into my routine
this is exactly the type of moisturizer i like.

this is the first lotion i have ever re-bought
especially for a day cream
this is the perfect moisturizer!
this product is great as a daily moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer!
this is a great moisturizer!
this moisturizer balances out her skin without irritating it
this is a good basic moisturizer
goes well under my sunscreen.
it is the most normal moisturizer out there.
my favorite thing about this moisturizer is that it absorbs so quickly
it's the best moisturizer i've ever used
don't need a thick moisturizer under my makeup
love this cream for everyday
every moisturizer seems to break me out.
this is the ultimate daily facial moisturizer that does not break me out
it's an efficient everyday moisturizer
this daily cream keeps my skin matte
it's the perfect daily moisturizer.
this a great daily face cream!
this is the only moisturizer that i've found that hydrates without breaking me out
this is an amazing daily facial cream that is great for all skin types
this moisturizer has literally changed my skin!
i definitely recommend this product as a lotion for day
probably not my holy grail moisturizer
this moisturizer is perfect for me.
just like all the other moisturizers i used it was on the expensive side
this is a great moisturizer
irritated from nearly every moisturizer i've tried except for this
it is a basic moisturizer.
it's a good lightweight (summer) moisturizer.
it is a pretty light weight moisturizer
basic moisturizer which i like
the best face cream ever!!
this moisturizer does not irritate my sensitive
the best face moisturizer.
i've tried everything from serums to concealers!
use the eyes serum massage around your eyes
night creams should be helping to "de-puff"
not affect eyeshadow application
i'd suggest using a cream or gel on top of this serum because it isn't really for that purpose
i think it's a good moisturizer
as i haven't been able to find a good foundation or concealer for the under eye
can apply my concealer without hanging around forever
the gel formula works great for my oily eyes.
i would prefer something more moisturizing such as elysee youthspan micro-firm eye creme
it is not a moisturizer- so should be used with one
it should dry before applying moisturizer/makeup
if it was an effective moisturizer as well it would get 5 stars in my book
i don't like thick eye creams
always had to use makeup concealer to try to hide my bags
i follow it with a hyaluronic acid moisturizer
leaves skin matte when used under shisheido white lucent moisturizer
it is very moisturizing to the point i don't put on my nose since i have combo skin
will use it sparely or alone under sunscreen
i usually find shisedo skincare to be too heavy
i started using shiseido sunscreen (blue).'
i also purchased the spf 18 broad spectrum moisturizer
then this mixed with the shiseido lightweight broad spectrum spf 18 moisturizer
this is more than a moisturizer.
this is one of my favorite moisturizers.
i love this moisturizer.
it works great as a day time moisturizer for my coho/dry skin
i would not use a moisturizer on top of this
it is more like a moisturizer
in the morning i follow up with shiseido spf 42 sunscreen
a heavy moisturizer on top
right before my moisturizer
i much prefer moisturizers that come in a jar.
most lotions/sunscreens/serums/makeup make my face itch
this is the most luxurious serum that i've ever tried
this is heavy enough to be a moisturizer in the summer
this creme is heavy
this moisturizer gives me such a radiant
healthy when i think about this moisturizer
this moisturizer is silky creamy yet it does not feel heavy on the face
i love this lightweight cream.
this moisturizer is great for caking on before bed
best face cream ever!
this moisturizer is amazing
i finally found my holy grail this works amazing to moisturize my skin it smells great
perfect moisturizer for the winter time!
moisturizer without being heavy
and this moisturizer is absolutely amazing.
will be sticking to this product as my new staple moisturizer
this is the first high end moisturizer i've ever bought
i never found any luck with any moisturizer
using the day cream
this comfort creme seems to do the trick
the smell is the first thing you notice when you use this moisturizer
next is the cool finish of the creme.
needed a better moisturizer for the winter months
i love the smell of this moisturizer, as well.
i love this cream.
which is always happen to other moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used.
it is the best moisturizer i have ever used
i love this cream.
this is the best cream for dry skin!
this is the perfect night cream for you!"
i looooooove this cream.
use it as my day cream
i love it so much it's now my daytime moisturizer as well
i love this moisturizer!
i probably went through a dozen different moisturizers
i even tried other dior moisturizers
i just use a tiny bit of concealer
i love this moisturizer!
this face cream is way above what i am normally comfortable spending on a moisturizer
sephora staff is not a big fan of this moisturizer
the moisturizer is excellent
the comfort creme formula is thicker
a lighter lotion for day time due to the consistency
this is one of my favorite face creams.
i've also tried the murad's essential c day moisturizer spf 30
the thickness of the moisturizer made my face break out
finally a moisturizer that lasts all day.
this is my 2nd tub of moisturizer from dior.
i love this eye cream
new favorite eye cream
i decided to try an eye cream that was more on the hydration section
love this eye cream.
first off: i rrreeeaaalllyyyyyyy love this eye cream
the eye cream is light
this is a light eye creme
this is best eye moisturizer i have ever used.
this eye cream is amazing.
i do love this eye cream
not the eye cream
this cream is light
this eye cream is the best i have used.
good for priming concealer to go on smoothly
i love this eye cream
i searched for years for a good eye treatment to use in the mornings before applying my concealer
creme yet gel texture was perfect for me in the mornings because not only do i only need a tiny dab
it does not ever pill up when i apply my concealer
the best eye cream i've ever used.
my go to eye creme.
this is the only eye creme i found to help
i really like this eye creme.
my under-eye concealer applies very well over it
then use a light firming eye cream
i love this cream.
works so great under my concealer
i've tried the dior hydralife eye cream when it was offered with the spf 15
the new version of the cream is sans sunscreen
because it contained sunscreen
this one is almost a creme/gel.
this cream is so light
why would i use dior eye cream?"
doesnt "pill" up when i apply my concealer
doesnt play nice w my concealer
as do his other moisturizers
m so tired of this search for an eye cream that works w my concealer
i love this eye cream.
this is one of the best eye creams i have tried.
i definitely wear less concealer around the eye area now
best eye cream i've found.
it also makes it alot easier to apply my under-eye concealer than my old eye cream did
my favorite thing about this product is that it created a very smooth base to apply my under eye concealer to
am going to order this eye cream
need a great eye moisturizer
i don't know if this eye cream is spf
this is the cream for you
i choose an eye moisturizer because of how it feels
this was the only product that really helped moisturise
i decided to start paying more attention to my skincare routine
i actually stopped wearing foundation or tinted moisturizer because my skin looks better on its own with just a little bronzer
this will stay a staple in my extensive skincare regimen
i usually wouldn't spend this much on a single skincare item
it does have alcohol so you have to use a moisturizer
dior skincare has always been my favourite.
i apply after my toner and before my moisturizer.
it's definitely become a new favorite in my skincare regimen
i also put my serum on top then my moisturizer
i don't even need to wear my moisturizer anymore.
i can get away with only tinted moisturizer
occasionally i have used this serum sometimes without a moisturizer afterwards
blusher just seem to be glowing on my skin
i do use a spf moisturizer on top of this
i started using it everyday before applying my moisturizer
can put my moisturizer or night cream on soon after
skin feels hudrated like i could skip my moisturizer
trying serums that would brighten my face
today i was trying on this awesome face lotion that i got for the 100 points beauty insider
as well as my morning moisturizer
i wanted a good serum to go under my moisturizer to help with the dryness
i just recently started using bare minerals moisturizer
i only use it once in the morning under my moisturizer
it really is the one essential thing that i need in my skincare routine
this cream is so light
no need for concealer nor botox!!
concealer under my eyes
provides a great base for moisturizer
best night cream ever.
my skin loves this cream
it is lightweight for being a night cream.
the cream was ok
this is the best cream i ever used
the consistency of the moisturizer is light to the touch
helps eyeshadow to last longer
i love this eye cream
has a built in primer for shadow and concealer.
best eye cream ever.
i've tried every eye cream under the sun
the day i put my concealer away in a drawer
there are about a dozen excellent eye creams/gels out there
all eye creams i ever used were not good
this is the best eye cream i ever used
it's very difficult to cover up with concealer
i can feel the difference from where this cream was vs where my other moisturizer
this cream truly saved me a visit to the dermatologist
believe i get good hydration with as little wrinkle visiblity with this eye cream
this is a great cream
i simply apply this cream
next i apply a bit of my face moisturizer under my eyes
i can't put on concealer without it.
i do put a moisturizer all over my whole face after applying
found it great as an eyeshadow base as well!
this is the best eye cream!
i do follow it with a light moisturizer that may help mask the smell
this eye cream is great!
i only use the cream for my face at bedtime
the face finishing moisturizer
this is not a moisturizer
you still need a moisturizer on top
but you still do need a moisturizer.
this is my daily go to daytime moisturizer.
it is a chemical sunscreen so of you're sensitive this product is not for you
i love this moisturizer!
this is the only moisturizer that saved my skin!
the fab 5-in-1 is so moisturizing that one can use a foundation product utterly lacking in moisturizer
i like this moisturizer
i tried different moisturizers
have a hard time finding moisturizers that will not irritate my skin
this is my new favorite spf moisturizer!
this goes on very much like a lotion when applied
this is a good moisturizer that provides sun protection without the white film on my face that some moisturizers with spf have previously left
which can happen from exposure with different moisturizers
this is one of the only moisturizers i've found that works for me without irritating my face
this one works well as a day moisturizer
this lotion has really made a difference.
i mainly purchased this for the spf because i'm really bad at applying sunscreen otherwise
light this lotion feels when you apply it
brighter since i started combining use of this lotion with my nightly regimen
i like this moisturizer a lot.
this one is my new go-to facial moisturizer
top it with laura mercier's tinted illuminating moisturizer
moisturizer for the first time
this lotion has a great "slip"
this is by far the best moisturizer i have used!
it's pretty expensive for a moisturizer
it works great as a sunblock
this is now my "go to" daily moisturizer.
so there is no second step to apply sunscreen
i love this face cream!
she asked about my face moisturizer
i've use this moisturizer for years now.
i prefer to use a moisturizer with a spf so was so happy to find this one
this is a good moisturizer/spf for women with dark skin
"multi-purpose moisturizer with spf30".
this is a great day-time moisturizer.
the same moisturizer that keeps my skin soft
i love this moisturizer!
have searched for the perfect daily moisturizer with spf
tried to go back to my old moisturizer
this is truly the best spf moisturizer i have ever used
this is a great product to use when you need a lightweight daily moisturizer
i both really like this moisturizer
this moisturizer is amazing fades fine lines
i feel better that it has sunscreen
great lotion, goes on very well.
i hate matte or oil free moisturizers
desperate to find a moisturizer that did what i needed
picked up this moisturizer
this moisturizer completely healed the dry larches that i had for two weeks that my old moisturizer could not help
once i finish up my current moisturizer
my usual moisturizers weren't cutting it
i can't speak to the antiaging properties of this moisturizer
i love this day cream.
this moisturizer is excellent for sensitive skin.
i always wear a moisturizer with a high spf
i love this moisturizer.
this is a great moisturizer
best part is that is has high spf without the sunscreen smell or feel
this moisturizer is ah-mazeing.
great moisturizer not tacky or greasy.
i've always had a hard time finding a good lotion with spf
most sunscreens irritate my face
works well as a sunscreen also!
i now realize the importance of using sunblock every day on my face
the 5 in 1 face cream is so light that it doesn't feel like sunblock
just really good moisturizer
it really is the perfect moisturizer.
but this is my ultimate daily moisturizer.
the 5 in 1 is the deeply effective moisturizer i've been hoping to find
i love this moisturizer.
most moisturizers with sunscreen make me break out
for day-to-day exposure the sunscreen in this has been enough
never going with another lotion
i love this moisturizer for the 30 spf.
i can still use my sheer transformation by ole henriksen over this moisturizer
this moisturizer works better than any drugstore or high-end cream or lotion
it has the perfect spf with no avobenzone which always makes me break out
if you breakout from a lot of lotions w/spf
s down my favorite moisturizer of all time
the 5 in 1 face cream comes with an spf of 30
since i can skip the step of applying a seperate sunscreen
i like that i can combine moisturizer with high enough spf in one
the moisturizer only peels off when you do not rub it in properly
put moisturizer on top.
this is one of the only moisturizers i can use
light weight moisturizer for my oily skin
this moisturizer is the best i've ever tried
i really like this moisturizer after i wash my face in the mornings
night with mattifying moisturizer on top
still seem to have lots of this moisturizer left
i love this moisturizer for keeping my skin clear
lovely product, definitely my go-to moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer we have found
most moisturizers only make the situation worse
this moisturizer is perfect.
definitely the best moisturizer i've used yet
this moisturizer is very light.
this lotion much more lightweight
i like this moisturizer i have combination skin
i went to my sephora store looking to replenish my clinique acne solutions moisturizer
how great this moisturizer would be for my skin
i love this moisturizer!
this is the best moisturizer i've ever had.
this is my go-to moisturizer
this moisturizer is no exception
when i asked for a oil-free moisturizer
then a moisturizer every morning
i really love it with the gel cream
it will stay in my skincare rotation.
one of the best cream clensers i've ever used.
i tried a lot of moisturizers before this one
i will definitely get the clearcalm replenishing gel cream
i went to a sephora store to buy a concealer that would cover my breakouts on my cheeks
after findind the perfect concealer
i wanted a similar cream moisturizer with acne treatment that wouldn't make my skin feel heavy
i do like to wear this under my daily moisturizer that contains salicylic acid
i prefer this as a daytime moisturizer
i typically use the kiehl's moisturizer along with the clinique spot treatment
great day time moisturizer for my oily skin
good moisturizer overall, i would purchase again.
this moisturizer is absolutely amazing
this moisturizer has helped my skin out so much
this is great as a day moisturizer
i find moisturizers really affect my skin
my long search for the perfect facial moisturizer is over
you can tell it's moisturizing your skin as soon as you apply it
this is my favorite face moisturizer for day
i think i will stick to this gel cream.
this is the best lotion i have used
works well under a tinted moisturizer as well which is a bonus
flaky skin if i don't -- this moisturizer has changed the game for me
this moisturizer would be more suitable for those with oily skin if paired with a toner
most amazing moisturizer i have ever used
it'll be my nightly moisturizer again
the lotion itself feels light
this is perfect over whatever acne creams you use
have never found a moisturizer that i liked
this is my go-to daily moisturizer
then comes this ren moisturizer!
i didn't need to use a skin cream
this is such a nice moisturizer!
have a hard time finding a moisturizer that isn't a
this is a good all natural moisturizer without garbage in it
this is good as a moisturizer
i now use clearcalm 3 cream
it is not a moisturizer, it is a treatment serum.
you need to wear moisturizer over this product to get the best result
i usually would get very red after applying moisturizers
as it isn`t a good enough moisturizer on its own
i actually use it on its own instead of adding a moisturizer to it
i started using it as my daytime moisturizer under my foundation since it's lightweight
i couldn't find a single moisturizer that didn't make my skin burn
put this on as a moisturizer
this is seriously the absolute best moisturizer for painful
had planned to add another ren moisturizer to my routine
i'll probably add another ren moisturizer in the winter though
i almost didn't want to moisturize
this moisturizer keeps that clean feeling
keeps my skin moisturizer without making it oily
i love it more than my favorite moisturizer.
my regular moisturizer applying to my whole face both morning
i go to put moisturizer
this moisturizer feels really smooth
this is my favorite moisturizer
i'll never use another moisturizer.
first time i try this moisturizer
i liked the moisturizer for my dry areas on my face
this has been my go-to daily creme in cool
i personally adore this moisturizer!
sometimes moisturizers containing sunscreen are hard to spread
like to switch up my moisturizers a few times a week
my eye area can be sensitive when it comes to moisturizers
i would recommend using a little bit of eye primer with it bc it can make your concealer crease a little bit
i really like this product as a daily moisturizer
the only complaint i have is that it leaves that white shadow that sunscreens tend to leave on skin
absolutely love this after using up the bobbi brown moisturizer that i wasn't happy about
believe all the comments that this moisturizer is thick
heavier creams tend to really bring the shine on
this is a moisturizer i never would have picked out for myself
i find this to be the best moisturizer i've tried for daytime use
after a frustrating search for the right daytime moisturizer with spf
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
the very first time i used this moisturizer
this spf cream is light weight
this is my daytime cream
my face craves this moisturizer.
i love how this moisturizer makes my skin feel
this moisturizer goes on light
my dermatologist told me to give the moisturizer up for awhile
i felt like going back to ole moisturizer
only face cream i ever use!
the sunscreen also works well
this moisturizer is great
this creme is so good for my skin
sunscreen is nice touch
smells great...not like sunscreen.
i feel like this crème leaves my skin soft
i used up this creamsicle super creme moisturizer first
i feel like goldilocks in search of a moisturizer that works
trying to find a face lotion that did well with my combination skin
i tried the sheer transformation moisturizer that came in the 3 little wonders package
stay away from spf creams just because i hate the texture
doesn't smell like sunscreen
i really like this moisturizer.
i like a day cream with spf since my foundation doesn't have it
got an example of this ole henrisen moisturizing creme
this is my second vial of this moisturizer.
while i use this moisturizer in the winter with a variation of other products
in the summer this is the perfect moisturizer to use to keep my skin supple
i love this as my everyday moisturizer.
this moisturizer is absolutely perfect for day time use
this time is my third time ordering this moisturizer because it is very moisturizing
this is the best sunscreen
i will use a more specific sunscreen if i am on vacation
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer does just that
wild rose skin brightening moisturizer
loving the sheer transformation moisturizer
probably why i'll continue my search for the perfect moisturizer
this moisturizer works like a dream.
this works way better for me than the advanced hydration moisturizer
that is the only downfall to this moisturizer
a good moisturizer every morning
serums aren't normally part of my routine
really helps my moisturizer absorb better into my skin
i still use a clinique moisturizer +spf in the morning
i packed a sample of this as a moisturizer on a trip
it is lovely as a serum under your night creme in the evening
use under regular moisturizer.
a must for your skin care regimen!
this serum is excellent instead of a moisturizer under primer followed my foundation
i can spend $50 on a bronzer
only in the morning after my moisturizer
it's not a moisturizer either.
you'll need an additional moisturizer
help me get a better line when i use my eyeliner
followed by a clinique moisturizer
best eye cream i have used.
+ the intense moisturizer
i do think this regimen has helped my skin
wear complete 100+ sunscreen daytime
it is the most perfect night eye cream
it's the best eye cream i've ever used
this is the one i find moisturizers the best.
this eye cream is amazing.
i love this eye cream.
this is the perfect moisturizer for me-- i need extra moisture for the winter
i pat on the lotion firmly
this is currently my favorite lotion/cream.
i love this eye cream
i am sure the retinol based eye creams will decrease fine lines
they were not good for my delicate skin the way the creme ancienne eye cream is
underneath tarte smooth operator amazonian clay concealer
this is the best eye cream i have ever tried for dry skin
amazing eye cream and i've tried all of them.
love the cream ancienne moisturizer as well.
this is a great cream
allows for concealer to sink in perfectly
i really, really like this moisturizer!
sat well under my sunscreen
this is honestly my favorite face moisturizer out there
this is a fantastic moisturizer!
this moisturizer combined with drunk elephants serum was just the answer to my cold weather dry skin
it's honestly the best moisturizing cream i've ever tried
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used in my life
best daily moisturizer i've ever tried.
this is the first moisturizer that has worked for me
i never thought i would pay this much for a moisturizer
this moisturizer provides good protection
i've tried almost all the "best selling" moisturizers
this moisturizer has helped so much with that
this moisturizer is amazing !
this is the only moisturizer i use to counter act the dryness
i love this moisturizer.
after using this moisturizer a few days
this moisturizer is amazing!
i keep coming back to this murad moisturizer
not anymore since using this moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer makes my face feel so soft
it's my holy grail moisturizer
i finally found the perfect moisturizer.
this stuff is awesome it has become my holy grail moisturizer
negative comments about this moisturizer
this moisturizer has helped my skin tremendously
this moisturizer is everything in life and more!
i am in love with this moisturizer
also works great as a night time lotion
this lotions does wonders for me
i like this it does wonderful moisturizer
this moisturizer is pretty amazing.
as a lot of "ultimate" or "super" moisturizers have been
i do like the thicker moisturizer for overnight care
i really love this moisturizer.
(better than the murad day cream with spf)
they suggested this moisturizer
it is the best moisturizer i have ever used.
this moisturizer is really great
tried a sample of the spf daily moisturizer
tried it when i ran out of my moisturizer
this moisturizer has really improved his skin
this is one of the best moisturizers i've ever used
my search for an effective moisturizer for my fickle skin continues
this is one of the best moisturizers i have ever used
definitely keeping this one in my skincare regimen
i found this moisturizer to be the best i've ever tried
this moisturizer is great for daily night use
this moisturizer is a little thicker
like some moisturizers do
searching for a moisturizer that didn't make me break out
solution now found with this murad moisturizer.
then i apply the murad moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer i have felt
i think of my face creams as a luxurious necessity
i love this moisturizer
this moisturizer is perfect for my dry combination skin
this moisturizer was originally out of my price range
i love the texture of this moisturizer
this moisturizer is actually just like the description says
i love this moisturizer
are constantly searching for the ideal moisturizer
i've used this moisturizer for about 6 months now
i've only had to moisturize once in the morning
with other moisturizers i've always had to reapply at some point during the day
lighter moisturizer for the summer
s down the best moisturizer out there
this moisturizer is a miracle worker.
this moisturizer is absolutely one of the best products that i have tried
hands down my favorite facial moisturizer.
stuggled finding a perfect moisturizer to prevent flaking when i wear foundation
the associate at sephora recommended this moisturizer
absolutely the best moisturizer i had ever used!
if i go outside i need to apply an spf moisturizer
this is the very best moisturizer i've ever used.
wouldn't recommend for an allover face lotion
my super dry skin loves this moisturizer.
this moisturizer literally last all day.
i am a moisturizer addict
this is an awesome moisturizer for the winter months
this is my favorite face cream.
this is such a great moisturizer!
i will say it isnt the best at removing waterproof mascaras
most days i don't even apply a moisturizer afterwards
the consistency is that of a lotion
though i don't wear heavy cakey products
wanted to try this for removing waterproof mascara
i wish they made a toner or lotion like this!!!!
i guess it's will be ok for people who use only powder or bronzer
now i use this face cream
this moisturizer works so well for my skin
this moisturizer balances everything out
this is the only moisturizer i've found that doesn't leave your skin looking greasy
love moisturizer an have tried many different high end br
this moisturizer goes on like silk.
this cream is medium weight
now i have prescriptions this does not moisturize enough
i love this cream.
i love this as a day cream
i got this moisturizer for winter use
at least with this moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer!
i've got this moisturizer as a sample
thickest moisturizer i've ever used
this moisturizer is amazing!!!!!!!
this is by far the best moisturizer i have found
this has been my favorite moisturizer for years!
i love this cream.
this is the only moisturizer i have found that keeps my skin looking healthy
i loooooove this face cream.
not too heavy with moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
so glad i finally found this moisturizing cream love it
low for the perfect morning/day moisturizer
i find that this moisturizer gets rid of the patches
this cream is so light
i really liked this moisturizer.
i love this cream.
its an expensive moisturizer
this is a really great moisturizer
this is a really, really nice moisturizer.
this moisturizer is fabulous
it is a best moisturizer i've ever tried
it is a lightweight moisturizer that does the trick
that i needed more cream
none of their moisturizers kept my skin moisturized for longer than a couple hours
this moisturizer was recommended by a bobbi brown sales person at another store
it is an intense moisturizer
i love to couple it with my bobbi brown tinted moisturizer
this light weight moisturizer is the best i have experienced
i've never really loved any daytime moisturizers
i must say that this is a fabulous moisturizer
it can be used on its' own or layered underneath your usually spf lotion for more hydration
chose it for my skincare regimen instead of this one
i am giving this cream a four star rating because i think it is a very good cream with moisturizing ingredients which i would recommend to someone with drier skin than mine
then follow with sunscreen
prepped for heavy under eye concealer
that's when this product was suggested to me as a base for the concealer
it naturally brightens the skin- even when you don't wear concealer on top
i love this cream.
l it is a great base for concealer
this moisturizer is great!
i've used this eye cream off
this eye cream is great
best eye cream i've tried.
love this eye cream.
it certainly works as a wonderful before-concealer cream for baking
i got this cream as a gift
concealer applies very smoothly over.
only sunscreen moisturizer for the past five years
i wanted a good moisturizing base for make up
so whatever concealer i used
now whether i apply concealer with my beauty blender
i apply it before i use corrector/concealer under the eyes
is the best primer i've found for concealer
my concealer kept creasing horribly.
love this eye cream!
my favorite eye cream!
apply concealer is just awesome for me now!!
this is the first eye cream i've used
this cream is pricy considering the tiny tub it comes in
it has improved my concealer application
it doesn't prevent all concealer creases
smooth base for concealer
i prefer it to applying concealer directly
this eye crème is light
doesn't pill or flake when concealer is applied
it also makes my concealer apply much easier.
it holds concealer in place all day
moisturizing even hours after you've first put it on
this eye cream is the best i've used
i always had issues with concealer caking
this eye cream allows for easy application of my concealer
i could not find a concealer that wouldn't flake or crease up under my eyes
now on a side note i never believed in eye creams i know a lot of this skincare stuff doesn't work
my favorite part about this product is that it helps my concealer last longer
i love this eye cream
this cream is amazing.
the best eye cream i have tried ever
keeps them ready for concealer
love this eye cream.
my concealer started looking cakey on my skin
the next day my concealer went on seamlessly
concealer go on wonderfully
have tried more expensive eye creams
i can almost put my concealer on right after i put this on
this is a lotion and primer in one!
smooth for hours when i'm wearing this moisturizer
i find it helps my concealer glide on in the morning
require little to no concealer
i love this cream.
i'd been using kiehl's moisturizer day
my concealer went on effortlessly
i can wear concealer again
i've noticed my concealer applies a lot better now too
my concealer goes on flawless
i love this eye cream!
just started using eye creams
i feel like moisturizing is what i want at this point since i have no wrinkles
a great starter creme for those new to a skin care routine like myself
you'll want to use a moisturizer after
except maybe change the moisturizer
looove <3 i never even though of using bobbi brown for her skincare
it needs a moisturizer on top for me.
i am sooo careful when picking out skincare
the moisturizers i received were okay
it also sits perfectly well under a moisturizer.
even under both a moisturizer
have no need for an additional moisturizer
i think i am going to need to use a more moisturizing sunscreen
i happened to be in-store buying some gel eyeliner from bb
she also recommended a light bb moisturizer.
i do not need a primer when i use this bobbi brown protective face lotion
this lotion allows any foundation to go on easier
the less actual moisturizer you're getting
i've yet to find a lotion to st
this is my hg face lotion!
s down the first moisturizer with spf i've found that isn't insanely greasy or sunscreen-smelling
the beauty consultant there applied this lotion before applying the bb cream
she showed me this lotion
am amazed at how great this lotion makes my skin
this lotion feels great going on
this is the best moisturizer ever!
this is the best every day lotion that i have ever used
then apply this lotion
this is an excellent sunscreen that works great on my oily skin
my dermatologist told me that the most important thing a woman can do to fight the signs of aging is to wear a sunscreen
i apply this lotion
i think this is a fantastic lotion.
i really like this moisturizer!it's oil-free.
now he uses it exclusively as his moisturizer
this moisturizer is the first thing i reach for
its worked as a primer and moisturizer for me.
this is both a moisturizer
moisturizer separately for this price
light moisturizer that primes the face very well for makeup
then applying my regular concealer
not cakey at all
this moisturizer is one of the best i've ever had
it is the perfect moisturizer.
a little goes a very long way of this primer/moisturizer
holy smokes, i love this moisturizer.
i've never used a thick facial moisturizer like this one before
love this moisturizer too much i tried to check out another moisturizer that was so expensive
this is by far the best moisturizer i've used!
one of the few moisturizers that did not break me out
this is one of the best moisturizers i've every used
love this moisturizer/primer.
this stuff is honestly so amazing -- you can use it for light to no makeup days mixed with a little bb cream or some concealer
the perfect moisturizer to use under makeup
this is a perfect moisturizer for my oily to combination skin
i don't moisturise my face at night
use this as my daytime moisturizer
this cream is not for every skin type
a moisturizer and primer all in one!
i noticed that when i put this on before my concealer it didn't crease as much
this is the prefect pre-primer moisturizer for any skin type
i definitely noticed improvement with my highlight concealer under my eyes
she's tried other moisturizers
it genuinely doubles as a moisturizer
since i have used this as moisturizer/primer
how can you beat a moisturizer
the moisturizer is very light
i don't really use foundation most days -- concealer
it's more like a moisturizer in texture
i don't use it as a moisturizer
for those who are looking to use this as a moisturizer
this really amps up my moisturizer
has all the right properties for a skin moisturizer
a light moisturizer under my normal makeup
i don't even have to use my regular moisturizer afterwards
have stopped using moisturizers
normal moisturizers do nothing
i don't follow up with another moisturizer
i started applying this over my regular moisturizer to my cheeks
then use my moisturizer
this is the only eye cream
this is the only one i have used that both moisturizers
sits well under concealer
it is the only eye cream that lasts
plus my undereye concealer doesn't wind up looking creased later in the day
it's my favorite eye cream
it's a fantastic base to appyying under eye concealer
this eye cream has completely changed the way my concealer looks
the hydrating eye cream no longer gives me the same results
it goes great under bobbi's concealer
best eye cream ever!
i've tried a million eye creams
it is the perfect base for application of under eye concealer too
love this eye cream.
it is too moisturizing for day with my eye make-up
this is my favorite eye cream.
i can easily wear it under my concealer during the day
use the eye cream as nighttime moisturizer.
face cream in winter as moisturizer.
this is my favorite eye cream.
makes concealer application so easy
i love this extra eye repair cream.
this cream is amazing.
my main concern when searching for an eye cream is for it to be super moisturizing
moisturizing enough to hold your concealer without looking cakey
works well under eye concealer
this is a great eye cream
it’s a part of my nighttime skincare regimen that i do not ever skip
i just bought this after researching best wrinkle creams
just dabs of concealer here
i added this right into my moisturizer
them go over with face moisturizer
eye moisturizer i use benefits face moisturizer
equalled what i would have paid for botox
this product can be used as a mask pack or worn with moisturizer
i also got a sample of the bareminerals undereye concealer recently
i don't rub the concealer in
put moisturizer everywhere else except where you apply this lotion
retinol is an antiaging miracle just in case anyone hasn't heard
you can then apply moisturizer
i don't follow with moisturizer or any type of liquid foundation
sometimes even rub a little moisturizer with it as well
i mix it with my moisturizer
do not want botox
follow that with my tinted moisturizer or make-up
after i put my eye moisturizer on i use kirkl
maybe mix with your moisturizer
i won't be doing botox again
if you mix a small amount with your favorite moisturizer
it says to follow with a moisturizer
so that i don't actually need to pack on a moisturizer after
i definitely need to use moisturizer after this serum otherwise my face feels dry
so for my aging skin i coul ddo nothing except moisturize
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
this is a really light-feeling moisturizer
need a good moisturizer that does not become greasy
done just what i've always needed a moisturizer to do
i just wear concealer
this moisturizer still helps despite feeling pretty lightweight
going from a cream to gel
its an awesome moisturizer
gave a chance to some other moisturizer
then i decided to give this amazing moisturizer sorbet a try
it is a really great moisturizer
i heartily recommend this as a moisturizer for sensitive skin
so let me start with this is the best moisturizer i've ever used
this is a nice moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
perfect moisturizer for intense co winters.
doesn't weight down the skin like some moisturizers do
absolutely love the moisturizer
this might be a top contender as my favorite moisturizer
i loved the way this moisturizer felt on my skin
this moisturizer is absolutely amazing.
i love this moisturizer!
best moisturizer i have found for my sensitive skin that breaks out easily with products
i love this moisturizer.
lightweight moisturizers that can be applied in layers as my skin needs
this is one of my top 3 go-to moisturizers.
i love this cream
've stuck to my normal moisturizer
normally stick to a light bronzer
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used
this moisturizer is amazingly perfect.
i don't know what it is about this moisturizer
this moisturizer has made my skin so happy!
now i can just use this one moisturizer
this moisturizer i recommend to everyone.
i love this moisturizer!!
i find myself constantly switching my moisturizers based on the day
i find that this moisturizer worked amazing!
i read that it was a facial cream
this moisturizer is so good
i always go for multiple layers of moisturizers to keep my skin from drying out
moisturizer when i run out
the moisturizer makes your skin look really smooth
it is a great day time moisturizer
because of trying multiple moisturizers
great moisturizer to apply before your primer for a quick everyday makeup routine
not only is it a nice moisturizer
i decided to try a different moisturizer
look for really light moisturizers for use in the day
it's the moisturizer i recommend to my friends.
i am really into this moisturizer!
read a piece on how crossover moisturizers
this, however, is my holy grail moisturizer.
loved this lightweight moisturizer.
love it best moisturizer i've used so far..
box and i really like this moisturizer.
i integrated this moisturizer into my skin care routine flawlessly
this is a very good moisturizer
sunscreen blended together in one
this is my goto moisturizer for sunny days.
with this moisturizer my skin comes back to life
i don't have to put extra sunblock
it's an expensive sunscreen
this eye cream is great
i love this everyday under tinted moisturizer.
perfect lotion for 40 something with prior combination skin
i wear sunscreen every day
thought i'd try this lotion since it has good spf coverage
they are looking at it like a moisturizer instead of underst
just a dab of concealer here
the retinol-based "poetry in lotion"
i would recommend this treatment cream to anyone who doesn't mind spending their day without foundation or tinted moisturizer
it is a day lotion and sunblock at the same time.
it is a wonderfully protective all day sunscreen!
will use this as my primary face sunscreen.
the pump makes the lotion last a lot longer
the only lotion i'm able to use all over my face
i don't use it as a sunscreen
under my regular sunblock
i think it's because of the sunscreen in it.
this comes out of the bottle feeling like sunscreen
it makes you pretty on its own so a little concealer
i really think this is the answer to our daily moisturizer plus sunscreen plus extra light therapy in a bottle
i tried my other sunscreen
always use additional sunscreen
reapply sunscreen if you are hanging out in the sun
all kidding aside i really like this lotion.
it is an excellent sunscreen
all sunscreens will do this
my concealer glides smoothly right on over the gel
works great as a concealer aswell!
the gel formula even fills lines so when you apply concealer
paired with the instant moisturizer
a great eye contour moisturizer!
this under eye moisturizer is affordable
now my concealer can cover the dark
id normally never spend this much for a moisturizer
decided to try the sephora gel
it doesn't leave any film on my face like some other moisturizers
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used !!!
this moisturizer is a new vital part of my daily routine
this cream on top
it is a solid, everyday moisturizer.
this is my daily moisturizer and i love it.
i wanted to get a good moisturizer to help repair the damage to my skin
i will be definitely going back to buy this moisturizer
used this as my moisturizer
one of the best moisturizers i've ever used.
i first got this moisturizer as a sample
this moisturizer has definitely helped my skin care regimen
i think i've found my new fave moisturizer!
its a good moisturizer for the price
i love this moisturizer for the morning.
this moisturizer doesn't make me more oily
i really like this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is great for people with oily/combination skin
this moisturizer has stopped my skin from flaking
i love this moisturizer.
this is a great moisturizer for a great price!
effective moisturizer that smells great
this moisturizer is pretty good
i am very picky about face moisturizer
safe to say my new holy grail moisturizer.
this is my holy grail for moisturizer now.
we still need a big boost of moisturizing in the fall
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
i needed an extra boost in my moisturizer for my face
otherwise it's a great, basic face moisturizer.
i absolutely love this moisturizer
sephora's instant moisturizer makes my skin soft

thats with all moisturizers in my opinion plus great jar for a decent price
this moisturizer is incredible!
she recommended this moisturizer in a travel size
this is a nice moisturizer
one of my favorite night creams.
perfect medium weight moisturizer
this is my favorite moisturizer i have found thus far
this is a good light weight moisturizer for the morning before i apply my makeup
i will never go back to my clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel
cases of this moisturizer loving how it makes my skin feel
this moisturizer however has been a godsend.
mixed this with the clinique moisturizer
i really liked this moisturizer!
ran out of my lush cosmetics moisturizer i usually use
it's not too heavy of a moisturizer
i do like this moisturizer.
am trying the intensive instant moisturizer now
i came across this moisturizer
it's a perfect moisturizer for the day.
spent a lot of $$ trying to find the perfect moisturizer
this is my go-to moisturizer for day and night.
this moisturizer leaves my skin calm and soft.
this moisturizer was absolutely perfect
my new face moisturizer
my concealer is definitely gorgeous with it
make my concealer perfect!
i love this moisturizer!
it's just a simple, nice moisturizer.
i went in to sephora to find a good moisturizer
an associate highly recommended the sephora instant moisturizer
it looked like a lot of moisturizer for a reasonable price
there is no doubt this is my new go to moisturizer
i've tried other moisturizers that were triple the prize
this is a great lightweight moisturizer for any skin type
this moisturizer is perfect for layering over my oil
i usually use a light moisturizer for combo to oily skin
when i looked it up i realized it was indeed a facial moisturizer
tried to find a cheaper eye cream
i am big on skincare though.
so a combination of both the diet and this cream.
allows me to wear during the day with concealer
great anti wrinkle, rich cream.
i hardly have to use any concealer
this eye cream is expensive
this is very cream
most eye creams are a joke
effective this eye cream is
i really like this moisturizer.
i like the buff color of the cream over white as white creams can sometimes require extra manipulation
i don't feel like i need to go out wearing tons of concealer everyday
this is the ultimate eye cream for firmness
i don't need to wear under eye concealer
this cream is so light
looked like i already had concealer on
obsessed with this cream!
if you ever tried caudalie's vinosource sorbet moisturizer
love this eye cream
amazing morning eye cream
it works beautifullywith the shiseido eye sunblock
then i apply my concealer
i love this cream
i've tried so many creams for my under eye bags
i usually use 2 eye creams
heavy moisturizer from my favourite skin care br
i loved this eye cream.
probably the best eye cream i ever used
i love this eye cream!
i love this eye cream!
love this eye cream
before buying this i tried all kinds of anti-wrinkle eye cream
you do not need a dermatologist if you maintain a caudelie regimen
this moisturizer is a treat.
i love this eye cream.
i just purchased my second bottle of this fantastic eye cream
using this eye cream
i can get by with only ysl's touche éclat as my undereye concealer
caudalie's eye cream was my a miracle cure
the premier cru face moisturizer is amazjng
i like this cream.
this eye cream does it all!!
purchased caudalie premier cru the cream for my daily face lotion as well
this eye cream is expensive
including heavy duty mascara
over-exfoliating is a big mistake!
i love that it melts away even my heavy duty mascara
looks like my chin needed just a bit more moisturizing
they used to have the day cream for this with spf 15
this creme is absolutely amazing.
this is an awesome moisturizer.
although the mega moisturizer is still very good
the repair crème is definitely heavier
i think it began while i was searching for finding moisturizers that have spf
didn't feel like i had that greasy sunscreen feeling
this is a really a great moisturizer for combination skin
this moisturizer is really helping
i usually have trouble finding a good moisturizer to use
this was my first time useing this lotion
this was the first time i ever put on this moisturizer
i would have to do that with no moisturizer at all
i tried the flawless moisturizer and loved it!
it layers nicely under the laura mercier tinted moisturizer
i've gone through two tubs of this moisturizer
i love this moisturizer for most seasons
this is an excellent moisturizer
every other "moisturizer" i've tried
then a moisturizer to feel moisturized so happy to find a product that does what the name describes
my favorite day cream.
this is a very thick moisturizer however
this seems to be the best moisturizer i've tried!
i started using the shiseido eye cream
overall a great everyday moisturizer.
if you don't like super thick creams i recommend getting the emulsion in the same line
this moisturizer is very thick
although this is the cream
s of facial moisturizers i have totally fallen in love with the benefiance line
this moisturizer is perfect for summer
it's a great daily go to cream
most moisturizers make me break it
does really well with this moisturizer
most moisturizers make my eyes water with their spf
this moisturizer is on the heavy side
i love the cream
much too intense than the lotion
this anti-aging cream feel luxurious when putting on
my mom loves the way it moisturizes
great for anyone who wants an antiaging moisturizer with some spf
i love this moisturizer.
if the wrinkleresist24 day cream is too heavy or emollient
this a great cream for the day.
this eye gel really works
this eye gel is amazing!
dehydration lines under them with this eye cream i can wear the driest of concealers
when it comes to this cream
one of my prior favorite eye creams made my mascara run
i needed a new moisturizer to replace my current moisturizer
my favorite eye gel/cream i've used so far.
this is one of the best eye creams i have used.
i am sensitive to almost all eye creams
works well with my under eye concealer
my last ysl eye cream cost $370
i can apply it right up to my eyelashes
i no longer have to use under eye concealer
i need concealer to hide it
best eye cream that i've tried to date.
my concealer does not look cakey
moisturizer for whole eye area
if not the best eye moisturizer i've ever used
love this eye gel.
this is one great eye cream.
allows my concealer to to go smoothly
i find using this alone is better than using concealer to "hide" my fine lines
so happy to be able to wear mascara
you can not find a better eye creme
i do like this eye gel
i love this eye cream.
my eyes were so bright that i didn't need a concealer
i've used clinique extra firming cream
this eye cream is phenomenal as a day cream.
makes my concealer go on effortlessly
night after i apply my moisturizer
this is my second purchase of this light weight eye gel
this moisturizer is great for winter/cold months or if you're using a strong acne medication which can be drying
i rarely apply moisturizers to my face at all.
you only need a little dab of the cream
my favourite cream so far!
it is the only moisturizer (and i have plenty!)
that doesn't pill when you apply foundation.
it's become my new moisturizer
works well under sunscreen and/or makeup.
i can only say that it is a moisturizer that is expensive
it didn't do that with this moisturizer!
it works great as a nighttime moisturizer too.
wanted a light weight cream
i love this cream!
i loved this moisturizer
using this along with their nightly facial moisturizer my skin has never been softer
wow, i love the hydration of this cream!
i love this moisturizer.
and i do switch my moisturizers once in a while.
this moisturizer has a light texture
best moisturizer i have tried to date.
it is a lovely moisturizer
i can't live without this moisturizer!
this cream is pricy
it is the most i have ever spent on moisturizer
i ran out of moisturizer
i usually use a light moisturizer on my oily areas
lightweight cream with near gel-like consistency.
the best moisturizer i've ever used
this is an almost gel-like texture which is very effective moisturizer i have been using for a few years now
this moisturizer is fantistic for day or night
this moisturizer is the best yet
this is a great moisturizer
this serum was definitely a splurge
after this i use the daily moisturizer.
this serum is a great matte base layer to protect your skin everyday
you can layer your moisturizer
then i use this product with eye cream
redness with concealer or heavier foundation or thicker tm
w=in 10-20 years when i need that extra moisturizer
it's a light serum that you can wear under moisturizer or alone
you should use it in combination with a good moisturizer
he uses this with the clinique for men oil mattifying moisturizer
then moisturizer with sunscreen
i put it on after my moisturizer
at night i put a little heavier moisturizer on
this lotion seems to minimize that
after applying my moisturizer
for every day use under moisturizer
so u definitely need to buy/use other products for moisturizing
let it soak in for a few minutes before applying my moisturizer
before i apply moisturizer in the morning
i started with the face finishing moisturizer
it is drying so using a moisturizer after is necessary
i could really see a difference in my skin--even under my moisturizer
after applying face finishing moisturizer
i also use the pmd facial moisturizer which i can't do without
i also use perricone's night moisturizer
not-so-expensive creams
i also love perricone's finishing moisturizer
it is the best night-time moisturizer i've ever tried --
i'll most certainly have to add a moisturizer on top of it
like vitamins for your face.
sometimes i add moisturizer on top
love to feel it glide over my skin during my skincare routine each morning
it is the magic cream wehope for every time we buy a cream
it's like botox in a cream.amazing.
i find i get more effective results with serums or retinol if i do not add moisturizer on top of them
great for wrinkles ladies!
this serum is a wonderful addition to my skincare routine
this has never broken me out like other moisturizers like the yellow clinique moisturizer
just don't forget use sunblock i think my skin is more sensitive after been using the cream
use less of the moisturizer b/c i feel that some areas of my combo skin don't need as much moisturizer as they did before
firming cream so figured i'd get the companion serum
that's the furthest from the truth with the serum or the moisturizer
dior one are the only two serums i've found worth the money
great under any moisturizer and make up.
i love this cream
averaging around $100 for its moisturizers
i couple it with the moisturizer
i also add an additional light moisturizer on top during the day because my skin is very dry
i love this product along with the moisturizer together the both feels so light
this cream is amazing.
i like this moisturizer.
i am a huge fan of this moisturizer!
i am allergic to almost every moisturizer out there
i tried a sample of this moisturizer
although i don't mind spending more on eye-creams
this is a perfect three season moisturizer
love the texture of this moisturizer.
this moisturizer feels great on your skin
this moisturizer is amazing!
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used
s down the best moisturizer i have ever used on my skin which is very dry
s down the best moisturizer out there for sensitive skin
this moisturizer really works
this is the best moisturizer .
lift as my am moisturizer
this is the first moisturizer i've been able to wear comfortably
i got a deluxe sample of this moisturizer from birchbox
it's expensive for a moisturizer
this is my third jar of this cream
this moisturizer is worth your buck
this moisturizer is lightweight
this cream made me look like i had a skin resurfacing
now i think i will definitely buy the cream as a day cream is fabulous
i just opened a new jar of algenist anti-aging moisturizer
i really like this cream
i got a free sample of this moisturizer
this moisturizer is no exception
this cream makes fine lines
i love this moisturizer
good moisturizer-not the best
i love this cream
i've used this moisturizer for only a few days
this moisturizer works very well under my makeup.
the moisturizer is very light
this moisturizer makes my skin so smooth.
it seems to do a nice job of moisturizing my skin overnight
so far, i really like this moisturizer.
i received this moisturizer in a beauty test tube kit
the serum is different in that's it's more like a lotion
this moisturizer disappears on my skin
i am very picky about the face creams that i use.
i like this moisturizer quite a lot.
a little bit of the lotion goes a long way.
this moisturizer does what it claims
this moisturizer keeps my skin smooth
doesn't absord as fast as a gel based moisturizer would
i doubt i would spend this much on a moisturizer
at least for anti wrinkle cream right now in my 20's
super satisfied with this cream.
if i didn't already have a moisturizer as part of my regular skin care routine
i literally haven't found a moisturizer i've liked for years
algenist skin creme is one of the 2 best that i have ever tried
f you can't afford to spend $95 on a moisturizer
it is a pretty thick fce lotion
similar to a light sunscreen consistency
great daytime cream with sunscreen
i really love this cream for my dry skin
i'll swear by this cream
so light but a great moisturizer.
i cannot use any other moisturizer on my face
i like that this moisturizer absorbs quickly
it has a spf 20 which you don't find very often in moisturizers
i love this cream!
low for an anti-aging moisturizer that won't irritate my roascea
this is by far the best full spf moisturizer that really moisturizes
no moisturizer has worked this well for me
will start using eye cream
the only bummer is this moisturizer does have a stronger spf smell than i'd like
i credit this moisturizer with helping me maintain healthy skin
this moisturizer goes on super creamy
this is the best face lotion
this cream is super light
i love this moisturizer
i wanted an all in one product that combines moisturizer
i do put a sunscreen over it on the day product.
although it’s a moisturizer i use it more as a treatment product
it doesn't compromise the texture of the moisturizer
a very light weight moisturizer.
i used this moisturizer for about 6 months
this moisturizer really makes a difference
i am 100% loyal to this moisturizer.
this is the 1st moisturizer i truly see results from
i love this moisturizer!
i will never go back to another moisturizer.
this is my current favorite moisturizer
this face moisturizer has been the most amazing find for me
this moisturizer has been perfect from day one
this face moisturizer even h
doesn't leave a white sunscreen film on the skin
using the serum does cut down in how much you need of the moisturizers
fantastic moisturizer that has helped my dry
also an issue for me with a lot of moisturizers
i highly recommend that everyone try this moisturizer
this moisturizer has really helped
have found that this is the best moisturizer i've found
i've never paid this much for a moisturizer
i am no longer searching for moisturizers
i love this sunscreen & moisturiser!
purchased the eye cream
so far i am loving this moisturizer.
it is a deep moisturizer without being heavy
i think this is a wonderful everyday moisturizer for most skin types
line,however this is my new favorite moisturizer.
my concealer would always look dry
my concealer made my undereyes look dry
buy more because of how much of a difference it makes when i apply my concealer
if your concealer cakes or creases then this is a must have
only on concealer-heavy days because it's a little too rich for my young
one of my go-to eye creams for quite a few months
i recently upped my concealer game to the nars radiant creamy concealer
it seems to be a popular concealer
the employee at sephora recommended this eye cream to me
my concealer sits perfectly on top of it
it's the best eye cream i've used
i like to coat my eyelashes with eye creams too
it is all thanks to this cream
i got that cream feel
this balm is life changing for my skincare around my eyes
used another eye cream
works well under concealer.
had been using the first aid beauty cream as my daily eye cream
this eye cream is the best i've ever tried.
if i'm wearing makeup i use it under my concealer
the best eye cream i have ever tried.
this eye cream is one of the only eye creams that i have been reaching for
great eye cream to use if you're starting to get into eye creams
i love this eye cream!
best eye cream i have ever used!
works amazing as eye cream and eyeshadow primer!
i own about 30 eye creams
this cream has time
i love this eye cream!
this is one of the best eye creams i've ever used
they're also great eye creams
this eye balm is amazing
after trying 6 different eye creams i love this one
nice primer for eyeshadow
i do not use concealer
apply concealer lightly with a brush.
too much concealer will undo the effect of the product
more firming eye cream
concealer etc you choose
the only problem i have is after it dries the package says you can apply concealer
sometimes the concealer makes the product flake off
only use a little concealer
you can use a non-cream based concealer that is totally oil free
this is the best product since the invention of mascara
adding any product like moisturizer on top is a no-no
i also wait a little bit to apply concealer over this
create the effect of a concealer
i would like to use a concealer over this product
even without the concealer the results are amazing
i wish ptr would make this in concealer skin tones or make it compatible with other eye products
take a clean eyeshadow brush to apply under my eyes
if you wear foundation use powder
this is one of the first eye firming creams i've used
this eye cream/treatment works!!!
you won't need that concealer when you use this
then using a concealer brush to apply it to my eye area
i miss in a little concealer with it for extra effect
they are minimized so that concealer can do its job
it is really just like topical botox
this is less effective when rinsed or combined with moisturizer--
even when using moisturizer/sunscreen
i don't need concealer when i'm wearing firmx
prior to applying i use a tiny bit of moisturizer on my eyes
you have to mix it with moisturizer
i dab my sunscreen over it and it still works.
this gel/cream formula is so perfect
serum or concealer i have ever used
it's best when applied over a light moisturizer
i put it on after moisturizer
works like a primer in a thick lotion-like texture
this is not a lotion
not designed to be a moisturizer.
i never need to use concealer or face powder anymore
apply it after moisturizer
before i put on my moisturizer
it can be used over the moisturizer or foundation as well
under-eye concealer apply
it is my favorite mattifying primer
i recommend waiting 5 to 10 minutes after you moisturize to apply this
sunscreen added would make it even better.
makes a great base for my tinted moisturizer
i apply it after my moisturizer with or without make up
even the most stubborn waterproof mascara
this one seems to be the perfect balance of moisturizer
i also use it to remove my matte lipsticks.
except for waterproof mascara
i apply moisturizer right after
tinted moisturizer or bb cream
i like waterproof eyeliner
it's the best moisturizer with spf that i have used
this product is always in my beauty regimen.
i will be using this product as my daytime moisturizer forever
i keep trying new moisturizers
because my regular kiehls moisturizer was out
this is definitely my go-to moisturizer
i like the moisturizer
after i will continue my search for my perfect moisturizer
i wouldn't recommend this moisturizer for very greasy skin types
the moisturizer is light weight
i can't wear my make up without applying this moisturizer first
this moisturizer is great, makes my skin glow.
this is by far my favorite daytime moisturizer.
i recently tried this moisturizer and love it!
i can't say better things about this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is light weight
this moisturizer is the best purchase i've made in a while
i usually hate moisturizers with sunscreen
it's not too heavy and it has sunscreen.
it's cheaper than a lot of other moisturizers on here
the added benefit of sunscreen is awesome
it has a nice smell, not of sunscreen.
a sample of the josie maran moisturizer with spf
i love this face cream
i've tried everything when it comes to face lotion
best oil free moisturizer i've tried for my sensitive skin
t was difficult finding a moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
cooling feeling i get when applying this moisturizer
i like the benefit creams
i used other moisturizers
to help glide this moisturizer on easily
i love this moisturizer!
i really like using this moisturizer.
i prefer to use it as a night cream
takes longer to absorb than i would expect a "lightweight" lotion
how i love this moisturizer?
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
it has spf which my former moisturizer didn't
for me this is the perfect summer moisturizer
this moisturizer is so luxurious.
benefit's triple performing moisturizer is perfect
moisturizer in one i love it
all around lightweight moisturizer for all
was delighted with this lotion
its an amazing moisturizer
this moisturizer was just what i have been looking to find
i've always been hit or miss with moisturizers
all in all a great moisturizer.
especially this daytime moisturizer
using a moisturizer with spf is vital for daytime
this is now my everyday moisturizer
i absolutely love this lotion!
it doesn't have that weird smell that most moisturizers with spf have
this is the first moisturizer that has ever helped with my dry skin in my t-zone
overall, this is a good sunscreen.
this lotion has been perfect
i got this as a moisturizer for summer.
i love this moisturizer!
i also use the eye cream
more intense moisturizer from this line
this lotion is good for that.
it is a very light moisturizer
the price is good too for a moisturizer.
this is the only way i can get my bf to wear sunscreen
this lotion is wonderful under make up
looking to find a moisturizer that not only moisturized
i find that this moisturizer
this moisturizer is lightweight
it's better than most moisturizers that i've used
because it is a very thick moisturizer
i think it is better used solely as a sunscreen
i would reccomend this moisturizer for very dry skin
i love this moisturizer- it's light
i knew i wanted to try this day moisturizer
the thing i love about this moisturizer is that it is lightweight
decided to keep it as my winter moisturizer
if i buy a strong moisturizer
eye cream from the beauty insider program
i like this lotion so far.
overall, i like the lotion very much.
many moisturizers cause me to break out
pretty much all moisturizers that contain sunscreen do that to me
it did exactly what i wanted for a daytime moisturizer
am very picky about sunscreen/moisturizers

of all the eye creams i've tried
i don't use concealer at all
this is the first eye cream i've used
i love this eye cream!
best ever eye cream.
this eye cream is amazing
obviously i still needed concealer
said she thought i was using some new concealer
i never needed eye creams
my concealer/foundation goes on a lot smoother
i always apply a layer of this before baking my concealer so my eyes don't get too dry
this is my go-to eye cream
this night cream is super thin
that you can see easily through concealer
this is one of my favorite eye creams.
use this eye cream for its brightening properties
brightens eyes to where i dont need concealer in the area
i dont wear concealer anymore.
really expensive eye creams
hard to treat lines that concealer
bought the big size- great moisturizing
i love this eye cream.
this eye cream worked miracles
the only gripe i have with this eye cream is that it's not quite moisturizing enough for my dry skin
i just love this eye cream
i love this eye cream.
i also like used it with different moisturizer.
have always jumped from moisturizer-to-moisturizer
best moisturizer i have ever used hands down!
this is a great heavy moisturizer.
this lotion is too good to be true!
this moisturizer has healed my skin so much!
regular lotion was not helping
this cream works wonder on my skin
it's a good light moisturizer for people with dry skin
this calendula cream at first felt a little heavier than i anticipated
but works great for a moisturizer as well.
i would use some other moisturizer
i am usually very skeptical of a creams for my skin
this is a great cream.
i've tried just about every moisturizer out there for dry skin
i love this cream as well as the calendula lotion
in the morning under my regular moisturizer
i love using this under my moisturizer for my texture problems
allow it to fully absorb before applying my moisturizer
everyone i asked would say i need to exfoliate
my facialist recommended this to me.
only use it at night under a moisturizer
best of all not saggy-big difference with this lotion
i find that moisturizer is needed after application for best hydration
fit perfect under my moisturizer
kate somerville's exfoliant i can actually see the difference in my skin
obviously moisturizer is key also
i also use this in the morning under a touch of my heavy laura mercier concealer
only eye cream i've tried
i do not have to pile on the concealer.
i like this eye cream.
i've mostly ditched my concealer
i guess it's due to my eyeshadows
i really like this eye cream.
they said it was also a moisturizer
do use another eye moisturizer cream
not sure if the dark circles improved 'cause i love me some concealer
does not get funky under concealer
this cream is more of a light lotion consistency
the cytocell cream also sits well under my concealer
this cream helps to minimize them so that the concealer doesn't settle in there
i've tried several eye creams that are good moisturizers
i stopped using under-eye concealer
this cream is expensive
do apply a more moisturizing cream under my eyes
sleep that cream is perfect for me
the best eye cream ever!
my concealer does not settle into my fine lines
i* really like this eye cream.
this is one of the first eye creams i have used
i love this eye cream.
i love this eye cream.
i always hated applying eyeshadow because my dry skin made it look awful
concealer around eye area as the skin is much smoother now
to be honest that is something concealer is for
this is my go to eye cream.
i like this eye cream
what eye cream does?
biggest pet peeve ever is when i apply concealer on a dry under eye area
very much a beginner eye cream.
i wear it under my concealer
it works great with it it does not make my concealer crease
this eye cream is amazing!
it doesn't make my undereye concealer look cakey.
this eye cream gave me all of the results those other creams gave
this is my new go to eye cream
an excellent eye cream from the "inexpensive" range of creams
i love this eye cream.
i've reduced my use of under eye concealer because it has been so effective
not exactly time for a wrinkle cream
definitely provides more moisture than my normal face lotion
the cream is nice
like a thin body lotion
i love this eye cream!
i like this cream
a very good basic cream
this is a preventative cream for me
non oily, doesn't make my mascara smudge.
this is a good basic eye cream.
my concealer glids right on after that
mix a bit with your under eye concealer
this is a good eye cream
this is the second tube of the first aid beauty eye cream i have bought
this cream is so gentle
this cream is nice
this is a great eye cream
i really like this eye cream.

5 in 1 works great under concealer
this cream is light
i usually get one of clinique's eye creams
i will try other eye creams
i really like this eye cream.
i love this eye cream!
fab is just a great skincare line.
not greasy when i apply my concealer
so far a good under eye moisturizer
i love this cream.
this eye cream is amazing!
it is a great non-greasy daytime eye moisturizer under time balm concealer
this eye cream was recommended to me by a sephora specialist when i asked for a moisturizing eye cream for nighttime
use it mainly as a moisturizer
this product in particular is a great exfoliator.
i really enjoy using this exfoliator once or twice a week
put moisturizer on after using this
the serum is perfect under a moisturizer
so basically i did got exfoliate
this is an excellent exfoliator better than philosophy microdelivery
a sephora employee hepled me to find an exfoliator that wasn't $70+
haven't found a better moisturizer that doesn't make me breakout
it helps your moisturizer
night before applying my moisturizer
the serum is perfect under a moisturizer
because i needed a lighter moisturizer
after applying the serum i topped it with a light minimal ingredient moisturizer
under my drugstore moisturizer
even with a very light moisturizer
this is my first time using a serum in my beauty regimen
my mske-up and concealer go on nicely.
i layer on my moisturizer right away
i actually wear a tinted moisturizer some days.
great eye cream with spf
my favorite eye cream.
one of the few eye moisturizers that has spf in it
most are just spf and not moisturizer.
moisturizer, serum, eye cream.
this was a great way to try it as i needed to purchase the moisturizer
i love the fact that this is an spf eye cream
love this eye cream!
i love this eye cream.
i did not expect to like how this product worked under my concealer because it has spf in it
fell in love with this crème
my concealer stays on pretty good
my skin seems to love this cream
i love this eye cream.
one of few with sunscreen
works great as a daytime eye cream
it's the first time that i have noticed how nicely my under-eye concealer goes on
never forget the eye creme
i can usually cover those with concealer
noticed the concealer/highlighter under my eyes was flaky
i love this eye cream for daytime.
i suggest using the "truth" eye peel in conjunction with this cream
i really like this eye cream.
there are so few eye creams available today that have spf
i live in the area where both moisturizer
eye cream need to have spf
was excited to find that this cream is 2 steps in 1 because it's a very nice under eye moisturizer that has spf 15
my under eye concealer goes over very nicely
i love this eye cream because it has an spf in it
i really like this eye creme
it is difficult to find eye creams with sunscreen
doesn't cause my under eye concealer to crease
i put on a retinol one before bed
i tried several under eye concealers
i started using this ole henriksen eye creme underneath my concealer
then my estee lauder under eye concealer
just be sure to tap the concealer on till it is absorbed
i love this eye cream.
i just concentrate on finding a great moisturizing eye cream that works well under makeup with spf
since i do tan at a salon
i love this eye cream!
i would definitely recommend this eye cream
this eye cream is amazing
i like this eye creme very much
this eye creme is no exception
i found that some eye creams that claim to be am
pm would make my concealer creep
this cream is great.
i put my eye concealer on right over the cream
i love this eye cream!
also works nicely with my concealer
the spf is also an amazing plus which is really hard to find in eye creams
the best eye cream i have ever used.
easy to wear under concealer too.
and it works great underneath concealer.
it works great with my estee lauder double-wear under eye concealer
it's great for using under concealer.
i love this eye cream.
i love this eye cream.
great for use under concealer.
this eye cream is non-greasy
this cream plumped it up
i put on a light moisturizer afterwards
planning on purchasing the face moisturizer
even have a prescription moisturizer
t's always hard to find something that will moisturize
i follow it with the hypoallergenic moisturizer
i rarely have to use moisturizer
a sample of the moisturizer as well as the "calm
if only i could find a good moisturizer.
this eye cream is amazing!!!.
this eye cream is amazing.
my concealer goes on so much easier.
don't moisturize like i want
i really like this eye cream.
occasionally i use a little dab to moisturizer my eyeshadow cream before application
i am not new to eye cream
my go to eye cream.
i love this eye cream!!
prefer fresh's rose eye gel/cream
i put it on at night under my moisturizer.
i wear an under eye concealer with this
i will no longer spend a fortune on eye creams!
i love this eye cream
or made my under eye concealer look cakey
doesn't feel tight like some "firming" creams can
i found one in the moisturizer
before using this eye cream
i tried using under eye concealers again
it's a lighter cream for day
my favorite moisturizer ever!!
i decided to dab this cream around my eye
works well under concealer
i can still see the concealer in my lines
an eye cream with spf during the day
the best eye cream i have ever used!
this eye cream works very well.
this is a great eye cream.
my new favorite eye cream.
i love this moisturizer for my 41 year old dry/acne prone skin
so a good moisturizer is
so began the hunt for a new hg moisturizer.
i absolutely love this moisturizer
this moisturizer is great.
then realized this little pot of moisturizer really lasts
i love that this moisturizer has no fragrance
it's unlike any other moisturizer i have used
i can honestly say this product is one of the best moisturizers i have ever used
my favorite part about this moisturizer is the limited ingredients
i try this moisturizer based in reviews here
it gives perfect amount of moisturizer for my skin
this is a great moisturizer in my book
this moisturizer helps balance my skin overall
this moisturizer is great!
i want anti -aging treatment in my moisturizer
i want my moisturizer simple
that is often dry no matter the moisturizer i apply
i started using the eye cream
thought about trying out the moisturizer
i would recommend a more rich moisturizer for a normal to dry skin though
i love this moisturizer.
my criteria for a good moisturizer is that it was safe for me to use during my pregnancy
this moisturizer fit the bill.
if it weren't the price this product is a wonderful moisturizer
i am so glad my search for the right moisturizer is over
this moisturizer was gentle enough for my skin
thick moisturizer that goes on smoothly
my absolute favorite moisturizer.
my face does not feel greasy with perricone moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer for sensitive skin.
i tried the "face finishing moisturizer"
although this is a thick moisturizer
this moisturizer makes my face feel soft
this moisturizer has been on my wish list for a long time
it's definitely my hg moisturizer.
i then tried this moisturizer
i'll definitely be adding the serum to my skin care regimen soon
this is by far my favorite moisturizer ever
is good for night after serums
this is the best moisturizer i've tried in years.
you do want to of course religiously use an spf sunblock
i would spread the rest of the lotion
i am also thinking of making this lotion
put on a bit of extra moisturizer
i always use sunscreen
it is essential that sunscreen is used with this product
except a tiny bit of my mascara
i didn't even need moisturizer after this product
while it does remove waterproof eyeliner
mascara i prefer getting that off with a micellar water
day cream with spf20
it is a heavier cleanser so you will feel like your skin is moisturized
will continue to keep in my beauty regimen
i didnt have to use a toner or moisturizer
moisturizer in one product
the second time i used this i didn't even need to use a moisturizer afterwards
this is the only balm that removes waterproof mascara without rubbing
didn't call for immediate application of moisturizer like other cleansers seem to do
i didn't need to use the second moisturizer i've been applying at night to combat flakiness
takes mascara and lipstick off very easy.
i put on moisturizer then went to sleep.
i usually take off my mascara first
then i apply drugstore moisturizer
the moisturizer isn't my thing
dry that i immediately have to put on moisturizer
in fact i loved it so much i began using algenist moisturizers
nothing a good moisturizer can't fix
although this cleanser doesnt remove waterproof mascara 100% it pretty close toit
it was like a creamy lotion consistency
it's getting so that i regret putting on my tinted sunblock
i am going to get a light moisturizer
it even takes off waterproof lancôme mascara!
s down the best lotion i've ever tried
if you're still searching for your hg moisturizer
great anti aging lotion for combination skin
i love this moisturizer.
perfect to use under your daily sunscreen
this was the lotion i decided upon
this moisturizer is great at night.
this is a lotion-cream that lives up to it's hype
this is a very good moisturizer for those with blemish prone
i just add two drops of some aragan oil to the lotion at night
so many moisturizers that promise you the moon don't really do too much more than moisturize
i do wish that it had sunscreen
i tried the algenist lotion with sunscreen
this is the best moisturizer i've tried to date.
use this as an overnight lotion instead of replenix retinol in summer
as a day moisturizer in winter
there are other oil free moisturizers that are good
now i used it as my everyday moisturizer.
heavy night creams are too rich for me
it does a lot for such a light feeling lotion.
a different lotion with at least spf 30 for daytime
this is my new go to summer moisturizer.
this lotion has turned my skin around!
this is a very good moisturizer for normal
this moisturizer is great for combination skin
it is a great moisturizer for day
i would recommend using the cream formula
i really liked this lotion right from the start
i went back to the heavier moisturizer version of this regenerative anti-aging
instead of the lighter lotion formula
i immediately went right back to the lotion formula
... this lotion is working ... very well !!
i mix one pump with my kate somerville retasphere 2 in 1 retinol moisturizer
i love this lotion
which is impressive from a light lotion.
this lotion balances my skin's different needs very well
the absolute best moisturizer i have ever used.
use this lotion mixed with the tiniest bit of clinique moisturizer
so far this lotion is a dream
this lotion perfectly fits the bill.
this lighter version of their heavier cream moisturizer is fantastic
i absolutely love the lotion.
moisturizer my face i immediately asked her what she used
very rich moisturizer perfect for the winter
not a daily cream more like a once a week cream!
so finding a moisturizer has been a struggle.
i swear i've tried every moisturizer
i've switched my foundation from makeupforever's matte velvet to nars` tinted moisturizer
i wish they made a body moisturizer!
a really good night cream.
i recommend this cream for any skin type.
this is the only moisturizer that i have found to work
i went back to this lotion
i love the consistency of this moisturizer -- it's like whipped
best moisturizer whatever ever.
i do sometimes use it for a day moisturizer
this is one of the best night time moisturizers i have ever used
this is much more than a moisturizer!
i would say this is a medium-weight moisturizer.
this is the best cream i'm ever used.
lift as my am moisturizer
at age 58 i have tried a million night creams
i love this cream.
this cream takes care of both
this cream is perfect.
i love this cream
i love this cream.
this is the best overnight moisturizer i've ever tried
this cream is not oil free.
it's a heavy duty moisturizer
i don't think i can spend that much on a moisturizer
beyond that i love how the moisturizer feels
sometimes i don't even need a day moisturizer to keep my skin pampered
flaky with a regular moisturizer
it blends perfectly with my sunscreen
the true miracle of this cream
cant live without this moisturizer
a moisturizer that works all day.
like the eye cream
i like to use this product in conjunction with acne medication in lieu of regular moisturizer
i can use a very good moisturizer that'll help my skin
do at right moisturize enough to me at first
in term of level of moisturizer
i likes it so much that i changed my moisturizer
it just didn't help moisturize my face.
especially if my $13 night cream does a lot better job of moisturizing my face
not it has added benefit of moisturizer
i usually buy my moisturizers from a drugstore so this was a stretch
no other moisturizer even made a difference on it
this moisturizer is the perfect balance to keep my dry skin under control
bought it with the day time moisturizer.
this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft
this moisturizer is pretty lightweight
it isn't greasy feeling like some other moisturizers
this cream is great
i personally enjoy the fact that it is unscented
i love this night cream!
its very thick moisturizing cream n i wanted something like this exactly to calm my skin overnight
most heavier overnight moisturizers tend to break me out
i usually do not use anything else other than the dramatically moisturizer facial lotion which does the trick
i recently added sunscreen
i know sunscreen is a must
sunscreen together dried out my face
i'll admit my experience with night creams that claim to do more than moisturize is limited to only 2 other br
i can't imagine myself ever getting a new overnight moisturizer
for a cream like this.
i've tried at least 15 big name moisturizers
this moisturizer is a keeper
in the morning use the lightweight oil free clinique moisturizer
i put on moisturizer then this on top.
i went with the moisturizer instead of just the serum because my skin was super dry
this moisturizer makes my skin glow
this moisturizer is a bit of a miracle for my dry
i thoroughly enjoy this moisturizer!
this is one of the best moisturizers i've used so far
it seemed like a good enough moisturizer
i love it, it is my new go to night moisturizer.
this is my second time purchasing this moisturizer
my skin still looks great compared to using other night moisturizers
been in search for a new night moisturizer.
this is my absolute favorite moisturizer in my skincare regimen
i love this moisturizer!
my usual clinique moisturizer just wasn't enough.
i love this moisturizer!!
i love this moisturizer.
this is a fantastic moisturizer.
which prevents acne from this richer moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer...
i love this face cream.
this is my new hg night moisturizer.
thought it was just another moisturizer
love this night cream.
i love this facial moisturizer!
this lotion will return my skin to normal overnight
i love that this moisturizer is oil-free for my combo oily skin
i've used the turnaround overnight moisturizer before
some moisturizers were too heavy
this is great for people who don't exfoliate on a regular basis
the feel of this moisturizer is silky
this moisturizer feels good on my skin
i really like this moisturizer.
this has been my favorite moisturizer to date
this night cream is great.
decided on this moisturizer for night
i've used clinique facial moisturizer for as long as i can remember
i love this moisturizer!
i skipped the tretinoin cream last night
this is a gel like moisturizer that is very light
do use other moisturizers
it's my bedtime moisturizer
after using this lotion
the lotion is very light weight
it's a great transition moisturizer for the fall
i like everything about this moisturizer
this lotion has become my go-to lotion.
actually moisturizers my skin all day
this is by the far the best moisturizer i have ever used
the best moisturizer i've ever used.
this lotion is super light
i just love this lotion
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used in my life
it works best under your normal spf moisturizer or spf foundation
it even gets through waterproof mascara.
gets my mascara off
hard to get off matte lipsticks
so good at removing mascara and eye liner.
this took off too faced better than sex waterproof mascara
it's great at removing everything from waterproof mascara to full coverage foundation
putting on my sunscreen
it's non-greasy yet it takes off my waterproof mascara
as it's not effective on mascara
i apply my sephora moisturizer
this one's also great as a base for the concealer that i apply over my dark circles
loved this daytime eye cream!
this eye cream was my saving grace!!!!
this is such a great morning moisturizer!
it has replaced my old moisturizer.
love this eye cream.
i really enjoy this eye cream.
along with the moisturizer
i started using this when i ran out of my holy grail moisturizer
not only does this eye cream refresh
lightweight morning eye cream
i feel super refreshed when i combine it with my origins ginzing moisturizer
i love this lightweight eye cream
i really like this eye cream!
i don't normally wear any type of moisturizer
i looooove this eye cream.
i find that it sits really nicely under concealer
leaving me a perfect surface to layer on my concealer
eye creams don't do anything for me
this is my new fave eye cream
this gel moisturizer was part of that set
its the perfect moisturizer for my entire face.
definitely enjoy this eye cream
along with the ginzing moisturizer
it helped with my concealer because i have dark circles
this a wonderful eye cream for the am!
this eye cream is magic!
i liked this eye cream.
loving this new moisturizer!
this eye cream definitely helped refresh

first time i use an eye cream
i love this eye cream.
especially under a light layer of under eye concealer
i love the ginzing eye cream!
i recommend using with the gel moisturizer
i really like this eye cream.
i love this eye cream.
that's what concealer is for
as soon as i started using it i could feel it moisturizing my skin
i noticed within a week a huge difference in my under eye area my concealer doesn't wrinkle
the cream is light weight
even prepping the skin for concealer
make sure to use a good moisturizer afterward
i used this in combination with fab moisturizer
i also used origins ginzing moisturizer
moisturizer has restored my 12 year old skin
i just don't prefer creams though this one lathers a bit
it's not good at getting off waterproof mascara
my skin felt ready to take in a moisturizer
some moisturizer will fix that
as soon as i put a moisturizer on my skin is nice
first aid beauty moisturizer
i don't feel like i need to moisturize right after
follow with a light moisturizer if prone to oily skin
i've spent crazy money on skincare
wears moisturizer throughout the day
this wash is perfect for my skin.
i just use a thick moisturizer like nivea after or aveno clean
it's not good on cleaning off the make up like mascara or stain lipstick
definitely use a moisturizer under this
then i would apply my facial cream
i love this cream
i applied this gel once every night
this is my absolute favorite spot treatment lotion
its normal just dont forget to moisturize
i'll never use another moisturizer.
this moisturizer for me it is amazing

after using a good moisturizer my skin feels perfectly fine :
definitely need to follow with a good moisturizer after
followed with my favorite moisturizer
always follow with a moisturizer.
i then finished off with a moisturizer
nothing a little moisturizer couldn't fix
i think i like the weight of this eye cream more
the cream helped a little
i really like this eye cream.
i usually majorly splurge on skincare
it keeps my undereye area so moisturizer
it also wears well under concealer for daytime.
swell to any other eye cream or moisturizer i've ever used
it is also great under concealer as it will make the makeup look less cakey
i love this cream.
i love this eye cream!
eye doctors works great as a daytime moisturizer when you are going to be wearing concealer
this eye cream is everything.
starting to wear under eye concealer daily when i normally wouldn't have to
was the extra concealer the cause of the dryness?
darkness so well that i stopped wearing concealer
love this eye cream
helps my concealer blend in flawlessly
this eye cream is perfect for me
leaves my skin ready for concealer
because usually the result would be cakey from my experience with other moisturizers
great moisturizer for under the eyes
this moisturizes better than any other eye cream i've used in the past
it is a great moisturizer
love this eye cream.
g make yourself youthful eye creams
this eye cream does not.
then follow with the nars creamy concealer
all good eye moisturizers come in small amounts
i think it's one of the best eye creams out there
this is the one eye cream for me.
this eye cream is easy to apply and mild.
this eye cream is so perfect
my under eye area was getting so dry that my concealer was apparent
concealer go on seamlessly
this product is on the cheaper side of eye creams however
had to wear a really thick full coverage concealer which would not spread at all on my skin
the concealer went on very smoothly
i even usually wear it under my sheer concealer
i love this eye cream!
apply the eye cream first
won't go near the eye area with my facial moisturizer
dried nicely with concealer over
i tried benefit's eye cream
i do like this moisturizer
i noticed that my concealer goes on much smoother ever since i started using this product
this eye cream was recommended
i put this on before my concealers
i just follow up with the moisturizer
moisturizer for about 6 months
is when i wear my shiseido facial sunscreen
best used with the moisturizer also!
i would definitely recommend to not forget to moisturize your skin after using this
moisturizer i've noticed a positive change in my oily skin
no moisturizer afterwards needed
the make a difference plus moisturizer
just make sure to use a moisturizer after.
i've also been using a daily oil-controlling moisturizer
as long as a use my regular moisturizer over it
especially with the accompanying moisturizer
also gentle enough to wash off mascara
moisturizer in this line
i did start out using the moisturizer only
the moisturizer by its self works great
i like to apply it just out of the shower while i do my hair/apply lotion
i imaging it would be a good nightly moisturizer if applied in a thin layer
this is a thick lotion that is great for the worst
i love it as a night time moisturizer
feels like lotion when it comes out
i didn't feel the need for any moisturizer after
can also be applied as a moisturizer.
a really lovely skincare find!
it comes out like a lotion
the daily moisturizer that i has been using
i still use a good moisturizer in the winter.
used it as moisturizer
i still use this product as a moisturizer when my skin is really dry or flake
its consistency is more like a lotion
i feel like i've applied some lightweight lotion onto my skin
i apply sunscreen 15 minutes after applying it.
a new moisturiser the consultant made me try a bit of another cream for daily moisturization
am always looking to hydrate my skin with either a moisturizer or mask
need to be careful with moisturizers
i just use this as a moisturizer
i'd been on the hunt for a new moisturizer
after reading reviews i started using it as a nighttime moisturizer
this moisturizer pass that test
this is my new favorite summer moisturizer!
figured i'd try the lotion
if you need an oil control moisturizer i would definitely recommend this product
overall, it's a good moisturizer.
by far the best moisturizer i've purchased
use this moisturizer in those areas
this product is a great buy for people with oily skin that need a moisturizer
good, versatile moisturizer for all season's.
this is definitely my daily face cream
i never thought i should use moisturizer
this is the perfect moisturizer
i used the murad skin perfecting lotion for blemish prone/ oily skin
i like this moisturizer
i love the origins moisturizer from the ginzing line
that one would have been my hg moisturizer
i didn't notice this moisturizer having any mattifying effects
this moisturizer does just that
i've noticed it's not the best moisturizer for my skin this time of year
i will need to switch to a different moisturizer for the winter
i plan on stocking up on this moisturizer.
switching to this moisturizer made all the difference for me
this lotion always leaves a pleasant feel
i wanted an effective yet lightweight moisturizer that won't leave my skin feeling greasy
this moisturizer keeps me matte all day
the smell of this moisturizer is amazing
i will keep buying this lotion
this moisturizer is fantastic!
this is the best moisturizer i've found so far!
decided to give this everyday face lotion a try
this is the only moisturizer i can use
decided to give this lotion a try
it is the best feeling moisturizer i have ever used for my oily skin
i absolutely love this moisturizer
a great moisturizer without the greasy feeling or look
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used!
this is honestly one of the best oil-free moisturizers that i have used
overall, a pretty good oil-free moisturizer.
i adore this light weight moisturizer
(and i don't even put lotion on/near my eyes.)
the best face lotion i've tried.
lightweight moisturizer that didn't leave my skin feeling taught or dry
this is by far the best moisturizer i have ever used
its the perfect moisturizer for my oily skin
this is the perfect moisturizer for me.
most face moisturizers leave me oily
this moisturizer is amazing for oily skin!
this lotion goes on nicely
use a different moisturizer most nights
this is the only lotion he will wear.
i must say i adore this face lotion
this moisturizer is perfect for the summer
this is the only lotion i allow on my face
i stay matte all day.
this is the perfect summer moisturizer for those with oily skin
this is a great moisturizer to use
it's also great under cream or powder foundation.
before using this for a daily moisturizer i was using philosophy hope in a jar oil free
an active lifestyle this is the moisturizer for you:
try this moisturizer, it's amazing
this moisturizer is quite effective at doing what it claims
maybe i'm expecting to much from this moisturizer?
without moisturizer it feels dry
zero oil oil-free moisture lotion is the perfect daytime
summer moisturizer for oily
this facial moisturizer is great if you have oily skin
i picked up this moisturizer for my combination skin
this lotion is completely lightweight
i need to bump up my night cream with a serum after use
i even tried origins brightening moisturizer because i heard such great reviews
the only reason i broke out from their brightening moisturizer is from the caffeine
just make sure to follow it with a good moisturizer
during the day i've used with my moisturizer
thinking why is she giving me hydrating gel when i just told her my skin was oily due to my acne medication
this is my favorite summer moisturizer
some say more moisturizer is needed
this moisturizer will always be my top pick.
this is the best moisturizer hands down.
i feel this is a decent-quality moisturizer
he loves that the moisturizer doesn't feel too creamy on his skin
this is such a nice moisturizer!
this moisturizer in particular i use every day twice a day
this is the best moisturizer i ever used
i love how this moisturizer gives me just enough hydration without making my skin more oily
i find more moisturizers break me out
do need to use another cream over some spots since this is a lighter moisturizer
this moisturizer is so good.
this is a nice, light-weight moisturizer.
good for the daytime, not as a night moisturizer.
this moisturizer is just gone
this is the absolute perfect lighweight moisturizer
i needed a new moisturizer
love this eye cream.
a couple of others hoping that one of them would be my hg moisturizer
i love this gel moisturizer.
this is my summer/warm weather go-to moisturizer.
i went right back to the store to buy this miracle moisturizer
i really do like this moisturizer
the moisturizer is great
great moisturizer to switch to in the summer.
i put sunscreen on after application
it's the first moisturizer i feel comfortable putting all over my face
this is my current night time moisturizer.
i am honestly nervous to start another moisturizer
this us the first moisturizer to not over our under moisturize my skin
other moisturizers sometimes feel heavy on the face
this moisturizer works like nothing else i've ever tried
i don't find it to be moisturizing enough on its own
typically use another moisturizer on top of this
i noticed since i've been using this moisturizer
i am so happy to find a moisturizer that doesn't contri
really investing in skincare
i wouldn't say this is my holy grail moisturizer
it can really dry skin if you don't use another moisturizer
even then i use additional moisturizer
i feel like this is more of a serum than an moisturizer
it's deff the best moisturizer out there
it's easier for your skin to absorb creams
love this moisturizer so much.
i can put on before i put on a tinted moisturizer
it is safe to say it is my holy grail moisturizer
this moisturizer is the best i've used so far.
thing with this cream : my skin
this is the only moisturizer i have ever felt comfortable using under my makeup
i absolutely love this moisturizer
even the moisturizer can't just be moisturizer
i got a sample of this moisturizer
this moisturizer does everything it claims.
i love this moisturizer
gel moisturizers do not normally work for me
this moisturizer is a game changer
the way the moisturizer is dispensed is kind of annoying
the best moisturizer ever!
i really like this moisturizer
i don't mind pampering myself
also my favourite eye cream.
this eye cream is great!
i need a product that moisturizers well
it doesn't give me the look that concealer would
i don't notice that it helps the longevity of my concealer
won't make my make up pill
its a good eye cream.
it worked great as a moisturizer
wrinkle-free my eye area is with concealer
ok so this is an anti-aging eye cream
it gives my eyes the moisture that my overall face moisturizer can't
like all creams i think
i needed something to use during the day that works well under concealer
this is a great moisturizer for your delicate eye area
wanted to try a new undereye cream/have sensitive eyes
upon applying this cream
love this eye cream
this is a nice eye cream.
i hate eye creams
this is cream has worked miracles!
this eye cream seems to work!
to the best of my knowledge this product is one of the best eye creams for night time
the moisturizer one time daily
combined with the moisturizer i may have found my winning combination
less time for me to wait to add my moisturizer
even under my retinol in winter
i don't use any moisturizer afterwards
in the daytime, i never use it without sunscreen.
i used this serum along with the turnaround overnight moisturizer
it ended up helping my moisturizer go on smoother
for me it's even better than the essence lotions
this can be used as a "moisturizer" on its own
put the matching moisturizer on after the serum absorbs
helps my moisturizer soak in
use it under your moisturizer morning and night.
i don't even need an additional moisturizer
helps my moisturizer sink into my skin
i love this lotion
sometimes i use a moisturizer
i sometimes get lazy with my skincare regimen
i don't even use a moisturizer after it
i used this serum along with the turnaround overnight moisturizer
it ended up helping my moisturizer go on smoother
it is my daily moisturizer day
the hot new "it" moisturizers because i always come back to this one
i would recommend to anyone trying to find a new moisturizer
this was the last moisturizer i ever thought i'd try
by far the best face moisturizer i have ever used
this is my favorite night face lotion.
on nights i use retinol this is what i put over.
tried about 5 other moisturizers that were cheeper
almost didn't have to apply a moisturizer because my skin felt so smooth
i wear this over the dramatically different moisturizing cream every day
tried so many moisturizers over that time
this is the first moisturizer i've ever used that i haven't had to apply more than one layer
seems to last longer then the gel cream one
this moisturizer is fantastic.
definitely my new favorite winter moisturizer!
i've had almost no breakouts this winter thanks to this moisturizer
this is an amazing moisturizer that has changed my skin
it's very difficult for me to find moisturizers that work for me
this is an absolutely wonderful moisturizer.
i prefer a thicker night cream
i do really like this gel cream
is a great day cream
this is the best moisturizer i have found
this moisturizer is heaven on my skin .
completely in love with this moisturizer!
under lotion with spf
this moisturizer works perfectly because it does not increase the oils on my forehead
this is my absolute holy grail moisturizer.
my favorite moisturizer for the winter
in the winter this product goes on top of my moisturizer day
it isn't the most expensive moisturizer
heavy moisturizer so only truly dry skin should be wearing this
the only moisturizers that have ever worked for me are like this
finding a moisturizer that does not irritate my skin was a difficult journey
this is the moisturizer i come back to over
i love this moisturizer.
this is a terrific moisturizer for me.
it works so well i can finally stop using my moisturizing face mask as a moisturizer
nothing else calms them for day use like this moisturizer
meant to purchase the other moisture surge lotion
under over my sunblock
this moisturizer is my absolute favourite
which i like because my skin will soak up any moisturizer in seconds
my regular moisturizer everywhere else
it's too moisturizing for me also that is why i broke our
my definite fav for night time moisturizer.
this is a fantastic moisturizer
it has a cream/gel consistency
you shouldn't use any other moisturizer
it doesn't leave your skin oily like most moisturizers
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer does it's job
this is the only moisturizer that i have found to work for me
after searching endlessly for the right moisturizer
i heard about this moisturizer through research
people if you need a great moisturizer for dry
when i used this moisturizer for the first time
you can use it as a mask or daytime moisturizer.
this moisturizer completely smoothed
honestly the best moisturizer i have found to use at night over my
this is a thick cream that in my opinion is best to be used at night after your skincare routine
this is literally the best moisturizer i have ever used in my life
i will never use another moisturizer as long as i live
do you know how hard it is to find a cream like facial moisturizer that is oil free
help your skin to look better by this miracle hydrator
i've tried a number of more expensive moisturizers
this is probably one of the best hydrating creams i have ever used
nothing was working until i tried this moisturizer
not necessarily my everyday moisturizer
use it under my moisturizer
letting my moisturizer adhere to me
i put it on followed by my moisturizer.
although i wore sunscreen daily
i strongly recommend this as it works as a moisturizer
i don't feel a need to use a separate wrinkle prevention cream or eye cream as this does everything
this really prepped my skin for moisturizer
i asked one of the girls in black at the store to help me find a good new skincare regimen
use a good moisturizer after this
thus my concealer doesn't cake as much
the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's not brightening or moisturizing so you still need to put face cream on top
moisturize eyes at least once daily
it was causing my concealer to cake a little.
it even makes my eyeshadow stay longer.
then i out a thicker moisturizer over it
am almost 50 and considered botox .
i also use like the "no concealer" right on top- i use thier moisturizer n "no foundation" in addition
do need an additional moisturizer in the winter
best eye cream i have ever used.
it is not a moisturizer
i find that i have to put a moisturizing eye cream on top of this
night under the hypoallergenic eye cream from this br
she then applied eyeshadow
explained this serum is an eyeshadow
i cannot stand heavy creams.
do not have to wear a heavy moisturizer
after using this serum all lotion
moisturizer just soaked in
the beauty advisor recommended i add this before the moisturizer as a "boost"
it pairs great with the oil free moisturizer
works well under any moisturizer without pilling
it's a good moisturizer that is lightweight
i think that this product would be great as a super lightweight moisturizer for more oily skin types
even when i layered it with another moisturizer
it also wears great under my moisturizer
i originally thought that just one moisturizer was enough for my skin
i can't use moisturizers that are too thick
then follow with my moisturizer
it’s so hard to find a heavy moisturizer that won’t cause breakouts
need a serum to prep my skin before moisturizer
layer my sunscreen over it
i've tried every moisturizer for my skin
recommended to be paired with a moisturizer
a normal moisturizer isn't enough for my skin
under my daytime moisturizer
it works as a wonderful light moisturizer
this is my favorite moisturizer.
seems to give my daily moisturizer a boost
extra moisturizer might be needed.
do usually use a moisturizer with any of my face washes
my recommendation for this is use with a moisturizer if you have dry skin
this balances everything especially when using the black moisturizer i live for this br
don't follow up with moisturizer right away my skin isn't more oily
at night paired with the clear complexion moisturizer
lifting creams that i can say i see some difference
this is a really nice moisturizer.
before this one i as using algenist's anti-aging spf 20 moisturizer
i love this cream.
this is my favorite moisturizer by far.
the moisturizer is my favorite
this is my "go to" firming and lifting cream.
i noticed my concealer has been going on
the consistency of the lotion is perfect-not heavy
i tried other moisturizers
especially when it comes to moisturizers
it feels light like a near gel cream
my perricone moisturizer over it
then apply my regular moisturizer over it
i wish it were longer lasting from the moisturizing aspect
this cream does help with firmness
i love this cream!!
it was my third new moisturizer trial
it is a great moisturizer, but not heavy at all.
plus for being a great moisturizer too!
this moisturizer really fixes it
this is a fantastic moisturizer for under makeup.
i immediately used it for this moisturizer
my other sephora intensive moisturizer once a day
i usually would not spend this much money on a moisturizer
lifting cream as my daily moisturizer
this cream is amazing!
this is the best moisturizer i have tried yet
no more prescription cream!
i like this lotion
this is an amazing eye gel.
i kept trying different eye creams
decided to try the gel
this gel lasts me all day
while i like to use something a bit more moisturizing for underneath my eyes
my sephora skincare go-to associate
my mom even thought that i was wearing concealer.
as i use algenist's eye cream
i prefer a gel eye creams because they don't crease under my concealer
eye creams are worth every penny
when i use this eye gel
i apply an eye cream over it
then put an eye moisturizer cream on top
best eye cream ever!!
you definitely need an eye cream
i do need to add a little extra moisturizing eye cream on top before i apply concealer because it does feel a bit on the drier side after application
it's now my 'go to' eye gel.
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
the cream is light
i still use a fair amount of concealer as always
don't need nearly as much concealer as i used to
would like to try the daily firming cream
best moisturizer for oily skin!
that first minute of me wearing this moisturizer is sickening
otherwise it is an amazing moisturizer
this is one of the best moisturizers i've ever used
i needed new moisturizer
i just love the smell of this moisturizer
i put this cream on
this is my favorite cream!
compared to other moisturizers i've tried for oily skin this one is super light
continue searching for a better moisturizer
beauty products i want a moisturizer that comes with a pump so that it isn't exposed to air
i can't see myself buying any other moisturizer.
it's a great moisturizer option for oily acne-prone skin
finally found a moisturizer that keeps my skin balanced all day
an every day moisturizer?
this moisturizer worked like nothing i've ever tried
because i wanted a light weight moisturizer
im obsessed with this moisturizer.
i went to sephora to find a moisturizer for my skin to be balanced out when applying my make up
my skin has never been more happy with a moisturizer then this one
the girl asked me what i was using for moisturizing
was recommended this moisturizer
i went to get a moisturizer
i decided to try this moisturizer after it was recommended to me
moisturizers usually make me oily
a very nice everyday moisturizer!
this moisturizer works amazingly for me
this moisturizer makes my face look so bright
i really did like this for a lightweight moisturizer
this is my favorite moisturizer of all time!
i don't need nearly as much since i started using this moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used for my oily skin
normally i don't pick out moisturisers that have a smell
none of my go to moisturizers were working at all
i layered it on my face for a nighttime moisturizer
there is nothing greasy about this moisturizer which i love
i hope they never stop making this moisturizer.
after a long search this is a good moisturizer.
this is my favorite moisturizer
i would have to agree that this moisturizer is lightweight
the only thing that i do not like about the lotion is the fragrance it's pretty strong for a moisturizer
i am sooo picky about moisturizers
i love this moisturizer
i ended up switching to the bosica black moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer that i use after i wash my face
i don't know if i'll ever use another moisturizer
using another moisturizer was not a good idea
i love this moisturizer!
my skin always requires a much heaver night time moisturizer
i am normally a weleda iris face lotion user
i put a nice amount of this moisturizer on my face every morning
i love this moisturizer
i wish they had the same moisturizer with spf!
this product isn't like most moisturizers that leave your face extremely oily
this moisturizer feels cool
who knew that a moisturizer like korres will work for a my face
this cream-gel moisturizer is wonderful.
i wanted to make korres my daytime moisturizer as well
this moisturizer kept the dryness in check
this is my favorite moisturizer
i stopped using moisturizer because my skin would break out within a day-so my skin
this moisturizer is perfect.
this moisturizer didn't do anything to lessen the oil
it's definitely up there with the greek yogurt moisturizer
this beauty right here is my holy grail moisturizer
i really like the texture of this lotion.
i am really pleased with this moisturizer!
this is one of the only moisturizers i have found that has amazing ingredients
i love the feeling of this moisturizer on my face
still not as long as i would like for an expensive moisturizer
it does have more of a matte finish than other moisturizers i have used
the smell of this moisturizer is amazing!
oh my gosh this is an amazing moisturizer for oily skin
works better than any other moisturizer i've tried
this moisturizer has been a life saver
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used!!
this moisturizer has helped balance out my very oily combination skin
obsessed with this moisturizer.
heavy moisturizers leave my skin oily
moisturizers that leave a matte finish leave me flaky
this is the perfect moisturizer for combination skin because it perfectly balances moisture with a matte finish
i habe struggled to find a moisturizer that helps balance my skin
this is the only moisturizer i need am
this moisturizer is light weight
i love this moisturizer
the moisturizer itself is not too heavy either
i love this moisturizer!
i've spent over an overwhelming amount of money just trying to find the perfect moisturizer
not only does this great smelling moisturizer leave my skin baby soft
this moisturizer checks all the boxes
at first i was not sure about this moisturizer
especially this cream-gel moisturizer is fantastic
apply this gel moisturizer first
this moisturizer keeps my skin soft
searching for the right type of moisturizer
it's the only moisturizer i use!
fell in love with this moisturizer
its my favorite moisturizer its the best
this is a great moisturizer for combination/ sensitive skin
this is a great moisturizer for very dry skin
it was the best moisturizer i've ever used
this is literally the best moisturizer i've ever used for my face
the absolute best moisturizer i have ever used for my dry skin
until i used this cream
clinique's dramatically different moisturizer gel wasn't cutting it for me anymore
bb xtra repair moisturizing balm does just the trick
i hope bobbi brown never stop making this extra repair moisturizing balm
this moisturizer has saved my bacon
wow how much better my skin is since using this moisturizer
all i can say is that this moisturizer gets used up
i won't use any other moisturizer.
i don't apply it like a regular moisturizer.
this truly is the only moisturizer i use.
this balm is amazing!
this balm is the thickest moisturizer i think i have ever had
more permeating moisturizer for winter
when i use different moisturizers
it's a super moisturizer that works well under makeup
this cream is unique than other cream.
i am a moisturizer addict
any heavy moisturizers/creams would make them exponentially worse if i used them at bedtime
this really is a great overnight mask cream
the same daily moisturizer awhile back
this is one of my favorite night creams.
moisturizer right bed bed
this cream is lightweight
love this night cream.
love love love this moisturizer.
i'd rather just use my belif aqua bomb moisturizer
can also be used as a daytime moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
this lotion is for you
love this night cream.
firstly i have olive skin which tans
this is the best night time moisturizer to help fade blemishes
i love this for an every other night moisturizer.
was especially excited about this nighttime moisturizer
this is one of my favorite overnight moisturizers
it feels great on your skin as an overnight moisturizer
i am going to purchase the regular moisturizer now because this sleeping mask is perfection
this moisturizer smells so nice when i apply it at night
without makeup on it looks like i have a glowy primer or moisturizer on
i absolutely love this moisturizer for night time use
very gentle to remove waterproof mascara
no amount of moisturizer could hydryate it properly after a wash
wanted to try it as it says it removes waterproof mascara
otherwise, this balm is amazing!
i got the holiday set with a daily moisturizer.
moisturizers on at night
yes that included waterproof mascara
it doesn't take off all my mascara
although product description states it removes waterproof mascara
i also don't need as much moisturizer afterwards.
this is a nice balm.
the part about conditioning your lashes is true.
almost like applying lipgloss to your face
wanted to up my skincare regimen
it's not a traditional moisturizer
i would think that ladies with dry skin would definitely need an additional moisturizer
ideal for mixing with your existing moisturizer
i do still need a moisturizer over it
now i use it prior to my moisturizer
though my day skincare routine is fantastic
the correction pads, eye cream and night cream.
not to be mistaken for a full on moisturizer
i moisturize on top of it with whichever moisturizer my skin needs that day
i consider myself a face cream "afficionated".
the cream is just like a miracle
i love this cream
my favorite part about this moisturizer is how it absorbs
a light moisturizer is fine for the summer months
to treat my face at night with a heavy duty moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer/primer hands down!
i really like this cream.
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used
i couldn't afford to get a moisturizer
i started with this moisturizer for under $100
this moisturizer is my favorite
i recently invested in this moisturizer
i noticed that i had a few applications left of my ole henriksen truth advanced moisturizing cream
this cream is nice
i found this creme when i decided to switch from a day moisturizer
to using a separate sunscreen moisturizer as my daily ritual because my skin is combination
i really want a "glow" which no daytime moisturizers seem to give me
i usually spend 3 times as much on "rich moisturizers"
it seems the more emollient they get
this cream is amazing.
really wanted to love this moisturizer since it makes my skin glowy
i received this moisturizer in a trial pack of three products
now my go-to moisturizer.
this is the only moisturizer i use now!
this is my absolute favorite night time moisturizer when not using my retinol night cream
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
is a really good moisturizer for winter weather
i love this moisturizer!
natural when i applied it over this moisturizer
this creme saved my skin.
truth crème is the only moisturizer that really makes my skin lovely
sun spots from tanning in a bed
love, love, love this moisturizer!
i got this moisturizer at the same time when i brought the night gel
very good moisturizer overall.
it's a nice right night cream that is a great addition to my skincare routine
i added a few drops of argan oil to this too at night which was amazing for a nighttime moisturizer
i love this face cream!
it's still my go-to moisturizer
this moisturizer actually brightens my skin
this is my daily go-to skin cream.
my skin is better now after using this creme
i consider this my "summer moisturizer".
the moisturizer itself was really nice
it is a nice overall moisturizer
so at first i was reluctant to try this moisturizer
was informed that there moisturizer is also made with spf
use this creme as a night time moisturizer
packs a big punch for a lightweight moisturizer
this is my go-to nighttime moisturizer.
this cream is lighter than most moisturizers i'm used to
this is my stand-by moisturizer.
flaky even after using normal moisturizer
i like the texture of this moisturizer
this moisturizer is fantastic!
for this moisturizer it's a little smelly
the use this cream
since i feel like i need something a little more hydrating than my usual moisturizer
when i ran out of my regular moisturizer
this moisturizer is light
my regular moisturizer can't take this heat
this is a great moisturizer.
best moisturizer i've ever tried!!
i love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is intense enough for my dry skin
the sephora consultant did tell me that it is an amazing moisturizer
i tried this truth creme and my skin drank it up.
since i began using prescription retinol my current moisturizer was not cutting it
have tried every moisturizer ever made
this is now my staple moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer for my neck
i like a richer moisturizer for these places
i know this is about the face crème
eye crème are fine
have to have a very effective moisturizer
absolutely the best moisturizer i've ever used.
this is a wonderful moisturizer!
keep my bb creams or tinted moisturizes to actually stay on my face the whole day
the off white lotion is similar in texture to a light eye cream
lotion for a nice little pick me up
so you have to use a mattifying primer
the mattifying serum in the morning before makeup
this serum is a really awesome boost under my daily moisturizer
it is a great light moisturizer that makes makeup go on effortlessly
my tinted moisturizer was making me oily by the end of the day
made my tinted moisturizer look better on my skin
along with fresh's clay moisturizer
i don't use it in combo with the clay lotion when it is dry weather
think it's worth the money for a good moisturizer that leaves your skin feeling smooth
it's a great moisturizer during the day
for one who piles on the concealer
this a great travel moisturizer
i tried a lot of moisturizers before this one
can work as a serum under other moisturizers
i smooth on a little laura mercier flawless skin sunscreen after i put on the moisturizer
i just use a good moisturizer after
this lotion works really well.
i must say though i had to use another moisturizer
this is overall a good moisturizer.
i used this one after the night serum without adding any layer of moisturizer since this one thick enough
the texture of my skin is not really lovely to touch after using this moisturizer
go for the diorsnow cream that comes in a jar
the only thing is i wish it came in a cream gel instead of a stick balm
when i use this my concealer doesn't crease nearly as much
gels are more for younger women.
absolutely love boscia eye balm.
it is a night cream
i love this cream.
it's just a great moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer.
i need a richer moisturizer
this moisturizer deff provides both.
first lotion then primer then foundation
i've found this moisturizer is the one i've been searching for my whole life
i like it better then the illuminating moisturizer
it is my go to moisturizer
found the most amazing moisturizer
this moisturizer keeps my oily skin balanced throughout the day
this moisturizer is pricy.
this moisturizer feels so nice when i put it on.
omorovicza balancing moisturizer is like a cool glass of water for my face
every time i applied a moisturizer after i used the balm
so, i figured i would try this moisturizer.
this moisturizer in particular is great for those with combination to oily skin
this is a really nice moisturizer
i can't use heavy moisturizers they break out my skin
so far i love this moisturizer
this moisturizer is definitely for dry skin.
the reason i don't give it 5 stars is that the moisturizing effect is superficial
i absolutely love this lotion.
i've never had luck with serums.
don't find the need for concealer
mixed with my moisturizer this gets the job done
i should be able to get thirty facials?
toss on a little tinted sunscreen
omorovicza has an illuminating moisturizer that is supposed to work as a daytime hydrator for skin types across the board
if you wear waterproof mascara
going for physical sunscreen products
it is a good product if you do not mind that it is chemical sunscreen
it replaces my moisturizer in the morning
i really do like this moisturizer
this as my moisturizer
like most sunscreens i've tried
i've had poor luck in the past with clinique moisturizers
i like this lotion
i wanted light weight moisturizer that's not oily
this moisturizer suits me very well
i really love this lotion.
only complaint is that is smells a little too much like suntan lotion
this light weight lotion slowly
nice lightweight moisturizer which has spf 20 .
i would recommend this lotion to someone who oily skin
i like that it's a lightweight day time moisturizer
i still use an all over moisturizer underneath this
the regular even better skin correcting lotion at night time
the skin ton correcting lotion isn't as good as they were
i like this moisturizer.
the turnarond overnight moisturizer at night
so i applaud clinique for this moisturizer.
the lotion leaves my face very balanced
this has to be the best moisturizer that i have ever used
doesn't pill when i'm applying primer on top
i am very impressed with this lotion for the spf protection
if i use a gel type moisturizer its not enough
when using the corrector you must use a lotion that has spf
i don't think i will love anything as much as the dramatically different moisturizing gel
clinique offers a cream instead of a lotion which is richer
she only uses super heavy duty cream
in three weeks i've seen even more amazing results to my skincare regimen as well as my skin
before my daily moisturizer
i again use it over my prescription retinol at night
works well daytime moisturizer cream
it just plain 'boosts' my serums
by mixing it in moisturizer
reapply moisturizer twice every morning
it's winter i'll add 1-2 drops to my moisturizer
do use a tiny bit in the morning mixed with my moisturizer
2-3 drops mixed in with my moisturizer
i've looked for over a decade for a moisturizer that was free of fillers
i tried so different eye creams
despite applying liberally sunscreen all over my body
then gently rub on my personal favorite clinique's moisturizing face lotion
this changed my skincare game forever!
juno is not only a beautiful moisturizer
my skin loves this moisturizer!
it blends in nicely with my super mild eucerine moisturizer
if i need extra moisture during the day i add 1-2 drops to my day moisturizer
i've never used an oil as moisturizer
can't imagine putting on my moisturizers without the product
once you apply a moisturizer over top
i've tried just about every skincare line here on sephora
i think this product is excellent for skin that doesn't absorb other moisturizers well
this oil gives me the kind of intense moisturizing that i was missing out on from creams
all you need in half a pump or maximum one pump of product to moisturizer your face
only this cream worked
the ceo moisturizer have made his skin look more even
this is a miracle cream, for sure.
you always have to pair it with a moisturizer
it wears great under my moisturizer and makeup.
tend to use a moisturizer instead about 3 days a week
all of sunday riley's skincare has worked great for my skin
so you may want to cut with moisturizer
this product is worth adding to your skincare routine
i noticed that i'm not using as much concealer to hide it
make sure you use it in conjunction with a good facial oil or nighttime moisturizer
after about 5-10 minutes of letting gg soak in i apply a good moisturizer
you have to use another moisturizer or a hydrating oil before good genes to keep your skin plump
you have to moisturize and it'll do the rest!
depending if i exfoliate or not
it goes on like a moisturizer
make sure to use moisturizer on top of it
it is a bit drying so you need to make sure to use moisturizer
t exfoliates my skin before i put on makeup
my clinique rep recommended this for my dry skin.
i just wanted a face cream
this cream is great.
this is my day cream
this cream does fill in wrinkles
got this with the spf 15-very light gel like cream
although it's a fairly thick moisturizer
i still use an eye cream
i don't follow with a moisturizer at night
then follow with my night moisturizer
if you like to follow with extra layer i think any gel formula moisturizer works great with it
moisturizers alone don't really work well
top it of with a moisturizer
i apply my moisturizer in the am
is meant to go on after your moisturizer
from raising my brows to apply mascara
i am just really happy with this moisturizer!
for a moisturizer it does the trick
i will use the fab moisturizer as well
only put this moisturizer on in my tzone
apply my regular night moisturizer afterwards
the fact that it's also a lotion really seems to help my issues with dryness
this moisturizer has a gel-like consistency
this is the great moisturizer.
much more vibrant since i've been using this moisturizer
ed on this moisturizer about 5 years ago
i decided to try this moisturizer/treatment
bonus that it's also a moisturizer
wanted something to revive my skin in colder months while using prescription retinol
love love love this moisturizer.
i absolutely adore this moisturizer
needed something that would help moisturize my face
this moisturizer will make me not get dry skin
i really like this moisturizer overall.
then use my fab moisturizer on my forehead
this lotion is a great treatment
you should definitely top it off with a thin layer of your favorite moisturizer
i also think this is more of a treatment than a moisturizer
then apply a more rich moisturizer
great moisturizer + acne treatment.
i prefer this in the summer when i like a lighter moisturizer
its a great moisturizer and good acne lotion.
have to resort to some other moisturizer
this moisturizer is great for my oily acne prone skin
this is my go to daily moisturizer!
this is such a great acne moisturizer for me!
lotion in the morning
i currently use this as my night moisturizer.
put on my day moisturizer
then trader joe's spf 15 oil free moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer keeps her face from peeling
the moisturizer is good
the lotion comes out really fast
ii use it daily as an acne-treatment/moisturizer
i then need to have an additional moisturizer to combat that dryness
i would say this might be the best moisturizer for acne-prone skin
perfect day time moisturizer that helps keep your skin shine free
or under a sunscreen because its so light
it's better than 7 days of using tons of concealer to hide them
this moisturizer is fantastic if you are struggling with very dry skin
sometimes i apply it under my moisturizer
my new favorite moisturizer!
this moisturizer seriously changed my skin completely
blows every other moisturizer i've ever used
i've searched for a moisturizer that would last
concealer so much easier
this moisturizer is amazing i've obsessed with moisturizer
i will never use another moisturizer!
my new favorite moisturizer!
i spotted their intensive instant moisturizer + cream
i love this cream!
this moisturizer literally last 24hrs
i enjoyed this face cream!
this moisturizer is amazing it's the best i've ever used
after i had used this moisturizer
there might be better moisturizers out there
this moisturizer is great!
i love this moisturizer it melt in skin
this is a nice moisturizer.
this moisturizer saved it
i love this skin cream.
i love this moisturizer because it doesn't feel greasy
i can apply my makeup soon after i have applied the moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer.
that being said, i love this moisturizer!
this has been the best moisturizer i have ever used
this moisturizer is just so amazing especially in the desert heat
this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
this is a heavier cream
i love this moisturizer
this moisturizer works for me
my makeup used to look cakey
child use this moisturizer daily sometimes twice a day in the winter
i like this moisturizer a lot.
i fell in love with this moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer!
very pleased with this moisturizer.
the sent of this moisturizer are light
this is my new holy grail moisturizer.
my new hg moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer if you have dry skin
i used this moisturizer when i had dry skin.
this moisturizer has a really great texture.
the price is great compared to most sephora moisturizers
always will be my favorite moisturizer
i love this face moisturizer so much!
i love to use this as a night cream for my combination skin
feels since i started using this moisturizer
great value for a moisturizer this size
it's just as good as many of the high priced moisturizers
i normally use high end moisturizers
this is my favourite moisturizer ever!!!
i used the regular instant moisturizer this winter
i like the intensive moisturizer more because it is thicker
is this the best moisturizer out there?
i got a sample of this moisturizer
i love this sephora moisturizer!
this is a wonderful moisturizer
for years i've been using the neutrogena oil-free moisturizer even though it's super liquidy
i love this moisturizer.
thinking it would be an intense moisturizer
after changing moisturizers to this one
i typically wear it during winter because i prefer a moisturizer with spf during the summer
i love this moisturizer.
i started with the regular moisturizer
this is my all time favorite moisturizer!
the regular instant moisturizer makes my eyes feel itchy
this cream does the trick
i love this moisturizer!!!!
i love this moisturizer!
i've never gone back to any other moisturizer
i decided to buy sephora instant moisturizer
i tried the original version of this moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
i do like this gel eye mask.
i still apply concealer
then i use a water-based moisturizer over top
this combined with my other skincare routine is really working for me
i definitely would recommend a good moisturizing lotion on top
then let it set to moisturize
don't really need a moisturizer
i would say this product is more like a treatment serum than moisturizer
since the aha is an exfoliating kind of agent
so make sure you use a good moisturizer
let it dry then follow with my usual moisturizers
i really liked this as an overnight exfoliator gel off
oil free moisturizer with spf as part of your daily routine
i really like the texture of this sunblock
i dont have to use a moisturizer on top
the ptr acne skincare line has impressed me so far
i started using this moisturizer on top of the max correction pads morning
this moisturizer seems heavy when you put it on
the only moisturizer i trust with my acne-prone skin
this moisturizer i find is good-- nothing exceptional
this is my go to moisturizer!
my new and one and only daily moisturizer.
this moisturizer was recommended to me by someone in store
i never use nicer pricier moisturizers
this moisturizer is life-changing.
i think it is the greatest moisturizer ever
i can barely use moisturizer
in fact, it might be my new go-to moisturizer.
even though i was happy with the moisturizer that i was using
my new holy grail moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
just started using moisturizer so nothing to really compare it to
i finally found the perfect moisturizer for my combo skin
it is the ideal moisturizer for combination skin in the summer
this is a perfect moisturizer for oily acne prone skin
i found this moisturizer which is perfect for my combination/oily skin
this moisturizer is the best!
it's a perfect moisturizer because my skin isn't super oily mid-day
this moisturizer feels good
this time i got the lotion
the lotion seems a little heavier
s down one of the best moisturizers i have used
this moisturizer was been amazing
i actually now prefer it to my old moisturizer.
hooked on this moisturizer
super lightweight super amazing best moisturizer i have tried yet
this is really moisturizers it without leaving it feeling oily
the best facial lotion i have tried!
i like having a facial moisturizer that doesn't have sunscreen for times when i just want a little something
and then i'll layer it with sunscreen.
sometimes just using one with sunscreen doesn't give me that nice moisturized feeling
this is the perfect morning lotion!
this moisturizer is so amazing
no moisturizer was able to bring balance back to my skin
this moisturizer feels a bit "tacky" to the touch after application
this also has proven to be a great "lighter" night time moisturizer
this is more of a lotion than a gel
this moisturizer is like nothing else.
moisturizers my skin without leaving it greasy.
the moisturizer does not leave a greasy finish
this moisturizer is amazing!
this moisturizer is light weight
this is the absolute best moisturizer i have ever used
the most challenging part of my skincare routine was finding the perfect moisturizer for my notorious oily skin
except my boy is the perfect moisturizer
put this moisturizer on every morning
this is a great moisturizer!
told me to buy this moisturizer after i wash my face
also this is the perfect moisturizer to apply under your makeup
before i used to use a moisturizer my nose area would begin to peel
best moisturizer i've found so far!
i love this moisturizer.
this is a great oil free moisturizer
this is a great oil-free moisturizer!
it's the perfect moisturizer for the winter.
etc" moisturizers i try make me break out
this is an excellent oil free moisturizer
s-down the best moisturizer i've tried
well, i found my hg moisturizer.
i adore this lotion.
this moisturizer is perfect for combination
i found this moisturizer to be very good for my skin
this cream is also very lightweight--it doesn't feel like you have moisturizer at all
i like this moisturizer.
this moisturizer actually changed the texture of my skin
i originally got this with another moisturizer
this is the only lotion i've found that doesn't leave my skin oily looking by midday
i just love this moisturizer.
best moisturizer i've tried, ever.
moisturizer i will use
try the anti-wrinkle eye cream.
and the anti-wrinkle night cream is superb.
this moisturizer feels light and healthy.
i really like the moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
this is the best lotion--little pricy
i usually don't wear a moisturizer since i have oily skin
this oil free moisturizer doesn't make my face feel oily or greasy like most moisturizers do
i know there's a better moisturizer out there
i should say that's one of the best moisturizers i've tried especially when you have oily skin
i freaking love this moisturizer!
it is a great moisturizer.
it is definitely my favorite facial moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer!
am very happy with my recent purchase of the ptr oil-free moisturizer
this moisturizer has a nice light feel
i love this moisturizer.
im hoping this moisturizer with the spf will work just as well
ptr's oil-free moisturizer is a very good daytime moisturizer for me with my very oily skin
this is my daily moisturizer.
this is a fabulous moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer ever
this moisturizer is very light weight
this is a great moisturizer!
i even wear a 30spf over the moisturizer
this moisturizer is very light
so i initially loved this moisturizer.
my makeup did not sit well on top of this moisturizer
i personally think that this moisturizer combined with a primer
it's a little pricy for a moisturizer
i only need concealer
i really love that this lotion mattes my skin
would buy again for my everyday moisturizer.
this moisturizer is one of the only products i can use everyday that doesn't break me out
this moisturizer would be amazing
this is the best moisturizer i've ever purchased.
this is the only moisturizer that is both lightweight
my skin is matte after this creme
my skin is matte after this creme
now i use this stay matte hydrator
the best matifying product is lancome pure focus matifying moisturizing lotion which is no longer available
i never used to wear moisturizer during the day because it always used to make my skin oily
i stay matte all day
even when i use sunscreen
it would be great if it had sunscreen
i apply before my moisturizer
put on moisturizer in the morning
i know that if you don't use a moisturizer
the only think i would recommend is putting a moisturizer on afterwards
i apply a good amount of moisturizer right away
i then followed with moisturizers
you definitely have to use a moisturizer on top of this
wear a light sunscreen during the day :
except for maybe a moisturizer
firming cream to use every night
the apply the deep moisturizer over this at night
i just put a moisturizer on top of it.
i asked the sales associate for a mask that is moisturizing
it's meant to be put underneath a moisturizer
so those saying its not a replacement for moisturizer
under my regular moisturizer
i tried every rich moisturizer i could think of
makes it easier for me to glide on my moisturizer
tried to go about my skincare regimen without it
applied this along with a rich moisturizer daily
top my skin off with caudalie's vinosource riche moisturizer
it will definitely continue to be a staple in my winter skincare routine
i put on the serum in the morning followed by a facial oil for extra moisturizing then sunscreen
the other moisturizer for immediate relief
in addition to spf moisturizer
my skin does great with the serum + spf moisturizer
my skin soaks it up right away which is great that way i can use one of my caudalie moisturizers
at night i layer moisturizer over it
it's light enough to wear under my moisturizer
it works really well as a moisturizer
she recommend this serum to apply before i use my moisturizer
which i then follow with a moisturizer
the sephora lady helping me suggested i put a few dabs on the dry areas before i apply my moisturizer
i put it on just before my moisturizer
although i just purchased the caudalie night time moisturizer
this will always be part of my beauty regimen.
top off with a moisturizer
if you're very oily i would even replace my moisturizer with the serum
layers of lotion without success
this in combination with the vino source moisturizer did the trick
i added it to my regimen for the winter
i still need moisturizer on top
i feel like it just increases the absorption of the moisturizer afterwards
applying moisturizer makes your face feel like it is on fire?
it keeps it moisturizer for hours without being greasy
adding a spritz or two of this oil really ramps up my every day body lotion to another level
i wish it came in a lotion or body cream as well.
this has replaced my morning facial moisturizer
i immediately replaced my body moisturizer with this
i put this on my legs before any lotion
it has a light sent that i use with my lotion everyday
i slather this all over myself after a shower--hair
like to layer oil then lotion
or leave in conditioner for my hair
use the extra to moisturize the backs of my h
the perume as my daily fragrance i wish there's lotion
i usually mix it in with my moisturizer
a mix of an exclusive sun tan lotion
give my skin that velvet-y moisturizer feel
i've mixed it with my face moisturizer
i started using this oil as a nighttime moisturizer
this is a skincare must for me.
recommend using a good moisturizer afterwards
i absolutely love the feel of it also the moisturizer that i need for my dry winter skin
my face always feels very moisturizer
my absolute favorite moisturizer
oatmeal is great for your skin
then follow with whatever moisturizer i'm using that day
leaving it on like a moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
i wear it under my tinted moisturizer/ foundation
none of moisturizer keep my face matte in more than 4 hours
tried it with a mattifying moisturizer as well as on it's own
it went on perfect over my normal moisturizer
this moisturizer is awesome
i love this moisturizer.
the best thing i ever tried for mattifying skin
i love this moisturizer.
this is a great moisturizer for oily skin.
this mattifying moisturizer last for hours.
so when i use most moisturizers
i love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is perfect for combination or oily skin
it is definitely my go to moisturizer
most moisturizers break me out
only moisturizer that i have found that i really like/love
regular moisturizer everywhere else
it might not be the greatest moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i've found
no moisturizer seemed to be thick enough.
this is a terrific mattifying gel moisturizer that keeps your skin looking fresh
when i pair this product with an spf 30 sunscreen
with any other moisturizer
this is a gorgeous moisturizer all-year long.
my favorite daytime moisturizer
this moisturizer works wonders
this is a wonderful lightweight moisturizer that works well with my combination skin in the summer
i recently try this moisturizer
i like it so far because it keeps my face matte for the longest time comparing to other moisturizers
i do love this moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer.
did need a stronger moisturizer for drier areas on my face
it doesn't feel like a moisturizer after i put it on
i don't use a moisturizer with it
the caudalie sorbet moisturizer for night
i like this moisturizer!
so i decided to use as a night moisturizer only.
serum to my skincare routine to boost the effects of the moisturizer until spring comes round
i usually use boscia's black gel moisturizer
personally really prefer super lightweight moisturizers
this moisturizer actually keeps the shine away all day long
said i should pair it with another moisturizer from the same br
this is a great moisturizer if you don't want to look shiny
low for a moisturizer that didn't make me super shiny by lunch time
it was my moisturizer
when paired with an intense night time moisturizer routine
this is a great daily moisturizer for combination oily skin
this moisturizer is supposedly for combination skin
i traded this in for the riche intense moisturizer also by caudalie
this moisturizer had been an absolute blessing
this moisturizer is like no other i'm so serious.
i've used this as my daily facial moisturizer for years
finally a moisturizer that works on very dry skin
this cream works well as a night cream for me.
when i apply this cream
i first tried the caudalie sorbet moisturizer
this moisturizer however really does the job
this moisturizer is one of the better ones i've tried
i lovee this moisturizer i've bought it a few times already
i prefer the scent of this to the other caudalie moisturizers
this is a very good moisturizer for sensitive
asked for a thick moisturizer on the more natural side
this moisturizer is perfect for me
it's great for midday touchups when i can feel my morning moisturizer start to fade
overall i really liked this moisturizer
it is a great moisturizer
using this moisturizer eliminated the afternoon shine
this cream is for you.
use the sorbet as an all over the face moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
with this face cream
this moisturizer is perfect for me either day or night
this moisturizer saved my skin!
all of the popular moisturizers out there
this is my favorite moisturizer
this moisturizer is the best!
this cream is a great moisturizer for dry
this is the second moisturizer from caudalie
this moisturizer my skin is normal again
i started using more moisturizers
this is the moisturizer i started using
it is an "intense" moisturizer for sure
best eye cream i've ever used..
i love this eye cream
work beautifully under my concealer
concealer -- the blue was completely gone
this product has some skincare properties as well as a concealer
i don't need concealer at all
normally i use concealer to cover it up
that this is not a concealer
to me it was just as a concealer
i put it on right after my other eye creams
i still use concealer afterward
i've found that i don't use quite as much concealer as i used to
with or without concealer
it works really well as a touch-up for concealer
when i need a touch-up i pat it in over my concealer
don't add additional concealer
works well under my concealer
sometimes i don't even need concealer!
on me it works better than any other under concealer i've tried
i still have to use concealer
wait 5-10 minutes before applying concealer because it's a little oily after application
i finish with a bit of matte nude eyeshadow
it's not moisturizing so you'll need something separate for that
this is a great base for concealer
i actually no longer have to use concealer!
i find myself needing less concealer
" it is not going to cover dark circles the way a concealer covers
this is the only thing i have changed in my skincare routine
you'll still need a traditional concealer
it isn't a substitute for my makeup/concealer/eye cream
resigned myself to a life of concealers
its got concealer in it
got this product to use as a regular eye cream
i would never think of going out with concealer
then to add the concealer, etc.
just remember to use concealer or under eye tinted color with this product
while also helping my undereye concealer go on smoother
i like using it because it sets down a nice smooth base for my under eye concealer
i love this cream.
this cream is amazing.
it's reminds me of a very light concealer
i can use less concealer now
used a skin moisturizer on top of it
i don't pair it with a moisturizer because it's too much for my skin
i like to mix it in with the moisturizer i am using or i use it alone
apply it before my moisturizer
i usually add a drop or two to my moisturizer.
i often use this at night over a good moisturizer
i still use it as an overnight moisturizer once in a while to restore a natural glow to my skin
like to mix 1-2 drops in with my moisturizer
i put 2 drops in with my favourite moisturizer
i even mix it in with my body moisturizer
love this product- i actually combine it with my moisturizer
otherwise i mix it in with my moisturizer as a boost
i mix 5 drops with my night moisturizer
2 drops with my day moisturizer
great product before any moisturizer!
i only put 4/5 because it doesn't do as well as moisturizing creams under makeup for me
every moisturizer i find has ingredients that will cause me to break out
works great under any moisturizer i've tried it with too
i just add a few drops to my moisturizer
will definitely repurchase to mix with my night moisturizer
this is moisturizing more than anything else.
now i add it to my nighttime moisturizer
using this in addition to my regular moisturizer
i mix 2-3 drops at night with my first aid beauty moisturizer
only favorite moisturizer from now on
i add 3 drops into my belif moisturizer at night.
since using this my skin has never felt more moisturizer
bought this to mix with my moisturizer at night.
i add a few drops to my moisturizer
i like mixing it with my moisturizer
for night i mix it with my night moisturizer for an extra boost of hydration
this oil also makes a brilliant moisturizer for the eye area
i mixed three drops of this in with a dallop of my moisturizer
skincare shouldn't smell good in my opinion.
i could go without moisturizer-as well it makes makeup look so glowy-i use byterry foundation
cannot act alone as a moisturizer
i mix in 1-2 drops with my moisturizer
with a moisturizer during the day
doesn't give you a feel of moisturized skin like after a creme
just use my regular day creme
i hate the feel of moisturizer on my skin
just make sure to apply an appropriate moisturizer after
even after wearing sunscreen religiously
i still habitually use sunscreen
i never thought i'd spend this much on one skincare product
i now just use a little concealer under my eyes
nightly use under moisturizer cleared my acne completely
need to lighten up on moisturizer
i decided to go with this one because i needed to add a serum to my skincare routine
moisture winner after trying 10 different eye creams or serums meant for what i call "lazylids
sold on this product's resultson my eyes-i can wear eyeshadow again
guess i'll save money on botox
i do let it sit for a bit prior to moisturizing.
my serum then moisturizer
then the brightening solution followed by the anti-aging moisturizer
a gentle vehicle for adding retinol to your routine
i am on my third bottle of this amazing retinol
dry then apply your moisturizer
a tinted moisturizer or bb do the trick now.
dermatologists recommend that you pair three ingredients to improve your skin
always as a cream formula
now it looks like i'm wearing concealer when i'm actually wearing nothing
this is the best retinol porduct that i've ever used
so now i wear it under my face lotion in the morning
i've used a lot less concealer since
absolutely manageable with a good moisturizer for the day
i also used a sample of a murad moisturizer
i don't put moisturizer on the area
it's all i buy from the moisturizer
i apply it to my t-zone after moisturizer
i just recommend after washing to use a facial oil or good moisturizer so the skin doesn't get too dry
because i've been using their moisturizer
i'd combat this with moisturizer which felt my skin feeling oily
have only needed to apply moisturizer a few times
the acne kit is a great buy.
just make sure to apply a good moisturizer
i love this moisturizer but hate the price.
this cream is everything and more!
serums from this company i know that the product really lasts
would probably use an extra moisturizer or diff moisturizer during the winter days
the moisturizer is lightweight on the skin
after my current moisturizer runs out.
i used this to replace my moisturizer for day
this moisturizer is the first one that i am truly impressed by
was using our moisturizer
this is the best face creme i've ever used --
a moisturizer for my oily/dry face
this cream served as a moisturizer indeed
this moisturizer is probably one of the best i have ever tried
the average moisturizer just makes my skin angry.
try it with the lotion
perfect for nighttime cream.
such a great feeling on my skin after applying the creme
definitely my favorite moisturizer.
this is the best creme i have ever tried.
the cream is expensive
t's hard to find one creme
it says to use after moisturizer
the gel formula is great.
this is one of my top fave moisturizer.
this is the only cream
while picking up a christmas gift i decided to look at creams
i figure why not pamper myself to this cream
this is a precious crème
i already have a great moisturizer
love this day cream
i will splurge for this face indulgence
this is my all time favorite moisturizer.
this is one moisturizer worth the extra money
this moisturizer is wonderful!
it is very effective as both a moisturizer
especially when you've been using other moisturizers
you'd pay this much for a couple of facials
i combine this with dior hydralife moisturizer
not being warned about using extra sunscreen
good moisturizer with sunscreen
it definitely does prepare it for my moisturizer.
it's perfect under my moisturizer
i got this as part of a set with the camu moisturizer
i don't need foundation or concealer
i don't know if it's the serum or the moisturizer that is giving me the results
you will need some kind of moisturizer
it's light enough to use under my spf moisturizer
i can't wait to get the moisturizer to see the combined effects of it
this serum is much better than the cream.
i can solely use a tinted moisturizer
planning on buying the moisturizer soon as well!
am always very careful in choosing my moisturizers
following with my usual moisturizer
i used this with the camu camu moisturizer as well
this could act as a light moisturizer as well
is great under moisturizer
heavy feeling that most moisturizers leave
want to get a head start on a good skincare routine
just wait until completely absorbed to apply moisturizer
the ptr camu camu moisturizer that goes along with this serum is a must have to get the results i did
i love this eye cream!
i love mixing this with my concealer under my eyes to brighten
my only complaint is that the lotion doesn't stay put
i love this eye cream!
this lightweight cream goes on after all of my 'beauty' ritual is done
i still need concealer
i dont need concealer anymore
this is one of the most amazing under eye creams i've ever used
another plus is that it makes your concealer look flawless
i found that applying this prior to makeup did a great job of moisturizing
doesn't make my concealer slick off
i highly recommend this as your everyday eye cream
sephora is offering the youth as we know it moisturizer
all time favorite moisturizer
hands down best moisturizer ever!
this is my go to moisturizer.
finding this moisturizer was a dream come true
cold moisturizer good for summer especially
better than most of my other moisturizers.
was in desperate need of a moisturizer to help me
i loved this moisturizer no matter what condition my skin was in
i tried this moisturizer and loved it.
super impressed with this moisturizer.
this lightweight moisturizer is perfect for day wear
i love this moisturizer i had got it in my ipsy bag
then i apply this moisturizer
this product is my go to moisturizer.
this moisturizer is perfect on its own
then i realized the moisturizer has avocado oil in it
i highly recommend this face moisturizer to anyone with normal or mix skin
t has been a struggle for me to find a good moisturizer
i want to get the body lotion now.
i really like this moisturizer.
this is a good moisturizer to use when you're not using something with an spf
s down the best moisturizer i've used
this lotion works like a dream.
years of trying to find the right moisturizer
i can not use another moisturizer under my makeup except this one
other moisturizers ive attempted make my makeup go on patchy
i love the ultra repair cream in the winter
this is a light lotion probably more for summer.
it is the perfect moisturizer for my dry sensitive skin
this is a perfect moisturizer to use every day.
this is a good basic moisturizer for oily skin.
then tinted moisturizer for a smooth
i apply this facial moisturizer over the ultra repair serum each morning
i originally purchased this product as a nighttime moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i have found so far.
this moisturizer works very well for all skin types
this moisturizer is amazing!
this is an amazing fall/winter moisturizer.
i really like this moisturizer.
i really do love this moisturizer
it is definitely not the holy grail of facial moisturizers
it is the perfect basic moisturizer that never irritates me
i actually love this lotion
it's kind of a gel/ lotion consistency that's very lightweight
alternate with a heavier oil moisturizer at night
i initially bought this moisturizer because i needed a non greasy light lotion for summertime
this is the most amazing facial lotion i have found so far
a lotion seems to be better than a cream
this moisturizer is a staple in my skincare routine
which can tolerate a stronger moisturizer
i used this moisturizer until i ran out
going without this moisturizer was terrible!
i think moisturizers are trial
this lotion saved my skin!
this is my favorite light-weight moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer i have found for my sensitive
i really like this face moisturizer because it is lightweight
i swear by this moisturizer for my dry skin.
it will stay a winter moisturizer for me !
i love this moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer!
favorite moisturizer so far!
this face moisturizer is a must have for dry
this has been my hg moisturizer so far!
you don't have to use a lot to moisturize your face
my usual moisturizer got a little pricey
i always have a problem with greasy moisturizers
this moisturizer eliminated the dry
you'll need additional sunscreen for daytime use
this moisturizer not only cleared up the flaky skin within 36 hours
i will say this moisturizer did not irritate my skin at all
does moisturizer to an extent
this moisturizer has 0 faults
the moisturizer went on like silk
it's the first moisturizer i've used that hasn't made me break-out
it's by far the best moisturizer i've ever used!
it cleared up my breakouts i was getting from another moisturizer
i just love this moisturizer
this is a great deep moisturizer.
use enough to moisturize your entire face
i love this moisturizer!!!!
this moisturizer is a little on the heavy side for me
this is my favorite moisturizer by far
this moisturizer gives my skin a nice glow.
this is my favorite moisturizer on the market!
i love this moisturizer
i swear by the fact that i am glowing after using this moisturizer
this is a must have moisturizer
this moisturizer smells amazing!
i love this moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer i have used that has made a difference in my dry skin
when i forgot my moisturizer at home
this is one of those moisturizers that immediately gives you a 'glow' on your skin
once the moisturizer is absorbed
the best moisturizer i have ever used.
have a really hard time with moisturizers
i love this moisturizer.
this is perfect for me under the tinted spa product i wear as foundation
this moisturizer smells great
my dryness has gotten much better because of this moisturizer
fell in love with this moisturizer
the moisturizer sometimes became super oily
even when i applied a sunscreen base
this is the first night time moisturizer that was recommended to me by an associate
this ptr brightening moisturizer is one of the few creams that instantly show results
i just love this moisturizer
it makes the sunscreen go on much smoother
don't find this moisturizer greasy at all
this cream is fantastic for dry
i am in love with the serum and the moisturizer!
it is a great nighttime moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i've tried in quite a while
i will definitely continue to use this moisturizer
after i stopped using this moisturizer
i really like using this moisturizer as a primer for my foundation as well
this moisturizer will definitely be a permanent staple in my skincare regimen
i love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer doesn't do this!
this moisturizer packs a punch!
this moisturizer is wonderful!!
this moisturizer is great.
i love this moisturizer.
best moisturizer i have ever had!!!!
skip the expensive facials, this just does it!
follow up with the glamglow moisturizer
after a good moisturizer, my skin felt amazing.
i can't wait to try the hydrating mask next
my skin gets more irritated than when i rub in my moisturizer
no other exfoliator/peel/mask has ever made my skin look so great
best eye cream ever!!!
i actually wear this with my avocado i cream by kheils
can get away with a much less "heavy duty " concealer
smoothness of the cream is simply the norm for all luxury eye creams
eye creams aren't really my area of focus
i think this is a great eye cream primer
it's more like a gel than a cream
it has thin consistency for cream compared to other moisturizers i have tried
this moisturizer is very effective
i love this cream.
it's hard for me to find good moisturizer
in the month that i have been using this moisturizer
i tan in a salon a few times a week
when i have applied nighttime moisturizer in the past
my previous daytime moisturizer makes my face swear
the moisturizer stays put
most moisturizers seems to leave my face looking a little red
its more of a gel than a cream
the moisturizer is very light
i don't even need additional moisturizer in the morning because the crème lasts even after rinsing with water
this moisturizer really helps
i wasn't sure this was going to be as good as a regular moisturizer for my skin
even better than a regular moisturizer
i really fell in love with this light gel-like creme
i've added this moisturizer to my sephora favorites
i follow up with a sunblock
i like this moisturizer.
definitely no break out from switch to this moisturizer
this cellumination cream is super nice.
use my usual concealer on the eyes
light cream gel that goes on like a dream
those with seriously dry skin will need to follow up with moisturizer
i only need to use two to three drops added to my moisturizer
’m very picky about my moisturizer
i definitely recommend this cream
this moisturizer absorbs right into my skin
it's definitely a little pricier than what i normally pay for moisturizing cream
this moisturizer has been great so far.
this is one of the best face moisturizers i have ever used
this is is a really good moisturizer.
not applying the lotion
i'd go with sk-ii's regular moisturizer which is anti-aging
this is the best moisturizer i've found for that
this is the premier moisturizer.
this moisturizer is so light
i loved this lotion so much
when i didn't use the lotion
so this labeled as cream is misleading because i feel like it is more of a treatment product not a moisturizer
use it like you would a retinol product
i would never purchase such an expensive item for a skin moisturizer
i really enjoyed using this moisturizer!
i could moisturize my entire face
i used this moisturizer twice a day
i put it on before my moisturizer.
i love the moisturizer within
this will be my go-to moisturizer from here on out
the cream definitely helps with dry skin
this is one of those type of lotions that a little goes a long way
this is a very thin moisturizer
i love that this facial lift emulsion does exactly what it says
everything about this product reminded me of an incredible moisturizing lotion i used to use that has since been discontinued called complex15
it has been a nice addition to my skincare regimen
this lotion did a great job of moisturizing my face all day
i can honestly say this is one of the best moisturizers i've ever used
i don't like to use a thick moisturizer
it makes my skin super smooth afterwards even before applying moisturizer
before my eye cream
go in with another moisturizer
you use before you put on your moisturizer
its not a moisturizer on its own
you get more than double the product than most moisturizers
this is a decent under makeup moisturizer.
i know at my age it's important to start using moisturizer daily
by this ridiculously expensive lotion
if you can't spend much on the cosmetics
especially now in the summer i need extra help to clean my skin of sunscreen
sort of like a dry oil sunscreen
even waterproof mascara beautifully
this was too heavy to use as an every day moisturizer
it only takes a dab of product to moisturizer your entire face
i only use the moisturizer at night only
this cream is expensive
be the perfect cream for you
s down the best moisturizer i have ever tried
i prefer keeping straight sunscreen off my fact
even after i forgot to wear sunscreen one day
does this stuff contain sunscreen?
it feels like this isn't your typical moisturizer or packaging
my skin wanted the cream again
my primer plus moisturizer plus my moisture spray that i gave up for this product does not equal or even come close to the price of this product
this is definitely a cream for someone who needs a mega dose of moisture
i love this cream!
this cream worked wonders.
i love this cream!
only this cream agrees with my skin.
you can wear it under your moisturizer
moisturizer on top of it
i apply my moisturizer on top of it
since i have starting using this moisturizer
i love, love this moisturizer.
i believe the proper name for this is actually brightening derm moisturizer
the cellumination mask-in lotion
the semi-gel like texture is perfect to wear alone as a moisturizer in humid summer days
use the eye cream
the cream is very light-weight
great moisturizer if you want a bright complexion
since i've used this moisturizer as part of my daytime regimen
especially in combination with the lotion
i believe good skincare is also a factor
refresh skin in one day... love this product
i also use it as a day moisturizer on drier skin days because it makes my skin so supple
it's hard to find a moisturizer that works for me through the night
i will continue to use this eye cream
i love this eye cream!
i like this eye cream
concealer goes on smooth
love it!this is a very light weight cream.
!i am very imipressed with this eye cream.
i am very imipressed with this eye cream.
this eye cream is just amazing.
love this eye cream!!
applying my eyeshadow has been so much easier now
makes applying concealer a breeze!
these creams are great
like every lotion i have tried
i am impressed with the way this eye lotion refreshes
said that masks help with pores much better than moisturizers
she also suggested a moisturizer to pair it for the wrinkles
the best exfoliating mask ive ever used!
finishing with my regular moisturizer routine
next purchase is going to be the volcasmic moisturizer
this cream is great for the cold
love this moisturizer used it for years!
or as a heavy moisturizer
this moisturizer was recommended to me by an employee when i went in searching fir a night cream
used as a day moisturizer
have decided to try it as a daily moisturizer once my current one is finished
definitely my favourite origins moisturizer.
this is an excellent moisturizer for dry skin.
i would recommend this moisturizer to anyone with dry or normal skin types
it's the only lotion that works for my oily skin
that said, this moisturizer is great.
tacky film that lots of other moisturizers tend to leave
this moisturizer does the work
this is my favorite moisturizer because a little goes a long way
this is the only moisturizer i've used that
i love this used under thicker moisturizers at night time or during the day as a light moisturizer when i am more oily
i like this product better than the make a difference plus+ moisturizer from the same line
it's difficult to find a moisturizer thats gentle
this origins moisturizer helps me get rid of the dry patches
it's more like a gel base not a greasy lotion base
it is a multipurpose moisturizer
this moisturizer is lightweight
i got this to use as a lighter summer nighttime moisturizer
some people use it under another moisturizer
more absorbant moisturizer like this
this makes a great summertime moisturizer
i opted for the gel-based treatment version of this product rather than the moisturizer version fearing the moisturizer would add further shine to my t zone
this moisturizer is no different
this moisturizer was reformulated about a year ago
the product is a great moisturizer.
another fingerful of the gel-creme will make them go away
this is my first time trying a moisturizer from origins
will break out easily will most moisturizers
i love this moisturizer.
dry skin so this moisturizer is just perfect for my skin
with this moisturizer a little goes a long way.
i think i have finally found the right moisturizer for my combo skin
i can't tell the difference between this moisturizer
i think it is little pricey for a moisturizer
even though it is a thicker moisturizer
i tried another origins moisturizer
try new creams every now
this moisturizer is amazing
this moisturizer has worked wonders for me
i love origins moisturizer line!
this is my new favorite moisturizer!
it's the only moisturizer i've ever found to moisturize my dry patches enough that they don't flake
just switched to this moisturizer recently
this is probably the best moisturizer i have ever used
this is now my favourite moisturizer!
acne prone skin so finding a moisturizer that doesn't add to the oil
this is the perfect moisturizer
this moisturizer is h
s down the best moisturizer if you have dry skin
my skin only loves this moisturizer.
it seriously loves this moisturizer
finally found a good moisturizer!
as an overnight moisturizer, this is perfect!
i am absolutely in love with this moisturizer!
great moisturizer for dry skin
i also feel as though a little bit of this moisturizer goes a long way compared to other moisturizers i've used in the past
this moisturizer takes care of all my dry patches
this is a great moisturizer for dry skin.
this moisturizer has been a lifesaver.
i think this tip from a dermatologist was key to any moisturizer
i found that the origins starting over moisturizer was too rich
i really like this moisturizer.
this moisturizer makes my skin feel soft
she gave me a choice of this or a moisturizer by clinique-i don't like clinique products
this moisturizer definitely helps relieve my skin
it's really the best moisturizer i've ever used!
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used for my skin
overall, i like this moisturizer.
i've found my new winter moisturizer!
this is one of the only moisturizers that work for me
this moisturizer is amazing.
this moisturizer is perfect.
i did also use becca's matte foundation with stila's matte bronzer
even though i moisturize after my morning shower
use sephora's acne-fighting mattifying moisturizer
i put it on top of my normal moisturizer after it has absorbed
this is one of my favorite moisturizers
this moisturizer is perfect for oil reduction.
i definitely recommend this moisturizer.
the alcohol from the pad tones my skin while the moisturizer does what's obvious
think i will keep mixing it with my moisturizer
i also like to use it as a moisturizer for my lips
put on my tarte concealer
rejuvenate my face before moisturizer
so now i just wear three drops of it after moisturizer
my regular moisturizer just wasn't enough anymore
1 drop w/ first aid beauty ultra repair face moisturizer
after i put my highlighter on
using this a moisturizer my skin has improved so much
then i put my moisturizer on top
regardless it was nice to try adding in an oil to my skincare regimen
i honestly put it on after my moisturizer
works wonders as a simple moisturizer
i tried every moisturizer in the book for my combo skin that had the worst dry patches
i also use this as a lip moisturizer before using matte lipsticks
i even put a drop of this in my day time moisturizer
this oil can replace my regular moisturizer
the tinted moisturizer was great on it's own
i several drops at night as a moisturizer
i can mix in my concealer
i don't even use night or morning cream anymore this is the only thing i use to moisturizer my face
because i have oily skin i tend to stay away from oil moisturizers
i'll probably continue my search for a good cream moisturizer as well
i love this eye cream.
i needed something that was more than just a moisturizer
this cream does the trick
i can put my concealer right over after it absorbs just fine
i still use concealer
great basic moisturizer for warmer weather or younger skin
under eye concealer blends nicely
my concealer goes on super smooth
i love this cream
definitely my new daily moisturizer.
this is probably my second favorite moisturizer right after the sisley black rose mask
this moisturizer provides such deep
its the best smell i've never experienced in a moisturizer
i started using this moisturizer over the winter
i didn't feel the need to wear tinted moisturizer everyday
i made the mistake of switching to a different moisturizer
its a great daytime moisturizer
with super dry skin this moisturizer worked wonders
wanted a moisturizer that would help combat the overly dry skin
started using this moisturizer
this is one of my favorite moisturizer ever.
my new fave moisturizer
i love this moisturizer because it's just as advertised -- lightweight
i am in love with this moisturizer
this is by far the best daily moisturizer i have ever used
all in all it's a really great moisturizer
after two more lancôme moisturizers i felt my face needed something more
is the only lotion she uses
it doesn't feel heavy like other creams
it is my favorite face cream now.
this moisturizer is my saving grace!!!
this cream does the job
think this moisturizer really is making a difference
ive been using this moisturizer for about a week
the cream is super light.
this moisturizer is great!
this is one of my favorite moisturizers!
which in my book is a must for a moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer.
this is my second lotas face cream.
love this face cream!
this moisturizer heals those spots in no time
i've never had a moisturizer like this
have to use a different moisturizer
i wanted a good moisturizer that had some anti aging aspects to it
this moisturizer had that and it went on nicely.
this lotion is magic.
this is the perfect moisturizer.
great night cream too.
i love this moisturizer!
i will put this moisturizer on
i wear this moisturizer under my make up
this moisturizer is my absolute favorite
if you want a luxurious/spa like moisturizer
this moisturizer is a great go-to
it is a great moisturizer
it's been really difficult for me to find a moisturizer that worked for my skin
tend to stay away from all moisturizers completely
this cream is lightweight
one of my favorite moisturizers.
this moisturizer changed my winter skin entirely
definitely is a an awesome daily moisturizer
i love this cream!
definitely one of my all time favorite moisturizers
sometimes as a moisturizer on its own
this is my second bottle of sunscreen.
it'll always be part of my skin care regimen
it's a perfect daytime moisturizer
i do like to pair it with either a retinol or tsubaki beauty oil at night for more hydration
does not cause concealer to crease at all
concealer on my under eyes so much smoother
it is so much better with this lotion
used to put a pound of concealer under my eye before this little miracle
i no longer use concealer under my eyes at all
applies like a gel cream
feels almost like a primer when i put on under eye concealer
love this eye cream!
could double up as a primer if you wear under eye concealer
asking for advice i decided to get miracle worker retinoid eye repair cream as it felt amazing on the skin
s of dollars of eye creams
this is the best eye cream i have tried
this eye cream is amazing!
i love this eye cream
i will splurge on pricey concealers which have still dried
i don't like creams or lotions that make me shiny
be warned: you must use spf with any retinoid product as it makes your skin more sensitive to the sun
so much so that my concealer just glides on over it
this is the first eye cream i've ever used.
the cream is light
decided that instead of using my lotion i would put this to work
i am still able to apply concealer on top
have had to use a lot less concealer in the morning
on top of this cream
i've also cut out concealers
it doesn’t make it run like other eye creams i tried
i don't need concealer at all
this eye cream is great!
helps concealer go on smooth not thick
afterward i apply my moisturizer
that shouldn't be a problem if you're moisturizing
i never used a moisturizer after.
require one to wear lots of sunscreen
doesn't make concealer or makeup look cakey if it's used on top
i wish it was a thicker cream
a good product to use with this in your usual face-washing regimen is caudalie-vinoperfect radiance serum
for a while i hid it with concealer
i will use this miracle cream forever!
concealer couldn't quite hide them
i hated using concealer
the directions say to apply moisturizer over
fab ultra repair face moisturizer
wore minimal tinted moisturizer after the second
then i put on moisturizer
night prior to applying my moisturizer
i don't need to put concealer on my dark spots now
with the right tinted moisturizer
i also use a really good moisturizer to combat the bit of dryness
if you do use this product, please use sunscreen.
the retinol does make your skin more susceptible to the sun's rays so just make sure to wear sunscreen daily
she insisted this was the retinol product to try
i would definitely recommend including retinol cream in your nightly routine
the lady waxing my eyebrows recommended i begin using a retinol product
this is my first retinol product
i think it's one of the best retinol products
i honestly were saving up to get botox
retinol as we know is the ingredient to keep away wrinkles
i love this night cream!
thought i should start using a moisturizer at night as a preventative measure
heavy moisturizers make me break out
this cream is the perfect weight
i apply moisturizer over
this is the best night cream / treatment ever!
i think i will use a thicker type of moisturizer with a lot of vitamins twice a week
after using this under moisturizer
thinking the retinol would be too strong
applied this cream after my nightly moisturizer
not through my nightly moisturizer
the product is better than botox!
the consistency is like the clinique gel lotion
generally err on the side of over-exfoliating
another basic lotion on top of this
i make sure to use a daily face lotion with spfas well
i love this night cream!
never would moisturize in the morning
i really love this moisturizer.
before i used this cream
ask a beauty consultant about a good moisturizer
incredible moisturizer for nighttime.
this moisturizer does everything i need it too.
the other moisturizers always left it feeling oily
ask about a moisturizer that was gentle on skin
this moisturizer did everything it said it would.
i can actually wear this moisturizer under my foundation
i tried 3 different moisturizers
i need a daytime moisturizer that works with humidity
this moisturizer is perfect.
i've tried a lot of moisturizers in my life an this is by far my favorite
the moisturizer is lightweight
if you need a lot of moisturizer to keep your skin from flaking
it stays matte for about 6 hours with the use of this moisturizer
this is an amazing moisturizer!
this product is horrible as a moisturizer
instead of an overall moisturizer
this has been the best moisturizer i have ever used
the best moisturizer that i have ever used
i wouldn't necessarily think of this product as a moisturizer
am in love with this moisturizer
this moisturizer is light
always had a tough time finding any kind of cream or moisturizer for my face
which moisturizer without being oily
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
until my doctor to recommend me to use non-comedogenic moisturizer
the anti aging anti pore moisturizer is so lightweight
they pill under your foundation
i will always buy this moisturizer.
this moisturizer has fixed everything.
this moisturizer definitely fits the bill
fits perfectly under non-oily sunscreen
i decided to try this product as a moisturizer prior to applying makeup
highly recommend for those who want a pre makeup moisturizer
this cream-gel moisturizer goes on easily
this is one of the few moisturizers that doesnt break me out
i just switched to this moisturizer
i used this under my algenist anti aging moisturizer with an spf of 20
this product is a light moisturizer that brightens my skin
that doesn't happen with this moisturizer.
some days i use this moisturizer
am constantly on the lookout for the best moisturizer
i first received this gel moisturizer as a vip reward
then when i tried this it became my new daily moisturizer
i love that this moisturizer is a combination of anti-aging
i hate to spend a lot of money on moisturizer
perfect gel moisturizer i have ever had
i am very careful with my skincare as i have oily
i decided to try this instead of my normal moisturizer
this gel is perfect for me
could never use this as a moisturizer alone
this moisturizer is amazing.
it is the best moisturizer that i have tried.
i sometimes feel like i need to use another moisturizer after
haven’t had good luck with other anti-aging moisturizers
this moisturizer is perfect for oily skin.
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
my foundation doesn't become greasy-looking when i use this moisturizer
best sunscreen that works with my sensitive skin.
works wonderful with the pore corrector moisturizer
i apply it in the morning under my moisturizer
i do pair it with the pore gel moisturizer they have too
definitely helps under eye concealer go on smoother
i don't even use concealer anymore
it's light like a gel
followed by an intense eye moisturizer
as long as you follow this with an eye moisturizer
acts as a sort of primer for concealer
it also works well under eye concealer.
this is not a moisturizer
so definitely put a moisturizer on top
i've had to apply very little concealer.
i won't have to use concealer at all
i can wear eyeshadow again on smooth lids
if you or best gorgeous gal isn't wrinkling yet: start wrinkle prevention now
isn't one to notice my beauty regimen
i look amazing without concealer
do apply a light moisturizer as well
i'd think the retinol is a great addition to my eye cream regiment
it helps prime my eyes for concealer/shadow
stop giving wrinkle creams a one star because they don't work for you
under-eye brighteners/concealers often make the issue worse
used in conjunction with my moisturizer
it is a great moisturizer!
you don't have to follow up with a moisturizer.
i only do if i'm going to wear concealer.
don't forget that 30+ sunscreen rain or shine
as a primer to another eye cream at night
i did not have to apply as much under eye concealer when i used it
i got this eye cream with a kit
i no longer feel like i have to have concealer everyday it has done a good job
the best eye cream.
this cream has done
honestly this cream is what's made me jump on board the tarte skincare fan train
i won't be going without concealer any time soon
most overrated eye creams
i love this eye cream!
tjmaxx eye creams my whole life
this cream is great
adding this eye cream to my beauty routine is the only thing i can attri
mpressed with this eye cream
this eye cream is the best i have tried
i wish this was a full face cream!
i love this eye cream.
i get a rash on my eye if the eye cream i use isn't moisturizing enough
i apply as a last step after concealer
having applied a different eye serum/cream when i initially moisturize my face
brighten while staying light under foundation/concealer
this cream really helped
cream is more moisturizing then my more expensive c eye product which makes it perfect for dry winters
i love this cream.
i dont need concealer
concealer go on more smoothly for sure
it sits beautifully under concealer that's set with powder
i love this eye cream
i really like this eye cream.
holds my concealer nicely and makes it last.
just finished my second tub of this eye cream
works great as well because i'm not a concealer/foundation person
i decided to try this after purchasing the maracuja concealer
it helps to even out the concealer application as level
i love this eye cream.
my concealer goes on a lot nicer while using this
makes it easier to apply concealer too
i love this eye cream.
is the perfect base for concealer
i enjoy using this eye cream
i love this eye cream.
preferably night because its just that moisturizing :
this is my miracle cream
i searched around for a different nighttime moisturizer
chapped skin that flaked if i even tried to apply eyeshadow
skin cream ever since
this is the most incredible moisturizer i've ever used
or i use a foundation/setting powder before applying eyeliner
wear this moisturizer combine w/josie's aegean foundation for a flawless-never dehydrated look
use this product as a daily night time moisturizer for my under eyes
because the lotion i was using wasn't strong enough
i am able to use it under my tinted moisturizer during the day
i need a new moisturizer
i always get josie's oil to moisturize my face.
this cream is super greasy like vaseline.
now i mix a dime sized amount with a regular creamy lotion
not as a daily moisturizer
i would use my regular moisturizer
use this as a pre makeup moisturizer if that makes sense
great hand moisturizer too, especially at night.
multi-purpose moisturizer i've found
i apply over my moisturizer morning
it's definitely more of a night time moisturizer for me
this has quickly become my new favorite moisturizer
i don't like the way it works with eyeshadow.
too much for a morning moisturizer
mixed in with my moisturizer
it is the most amazing moisturizer
t's thicker than other moisturizers out there
it makes for a great night time moisturizer
i like it to nourish my lashes every night when it's free from mascara
i've already used it as lip moisturizer
applied before bed as my night moisturizer once
this product is my favorite moisturizer
mix it into my day moisturizer as needed
i really feel the combo of this cream
i've tried every eye cream under the sun
this product is also great for just about every other skin care need: i sometimes mix it with eyeshadows snd blushes to make a custom moisturizing lip balm
overnight i use it as an under eye moisturizer
this moisturizer combats both
it stars as a cream
i tried for years to simply use virgin coconut oil as a moisturizer alternative
i would wear it during the day as a moisturizer
the eye creme is very moisturizing you only use a small amount it's a small jar
dior eye cream is awesome
this anti-aging moisturizer is exceptional.
the best moisturizer for night!!
i usually use lamer moisturizer cream
a lot of moisturizers seem to cake
this is the only cream that has worked on my skin
the cream applies well to your skin
i love this cream.
it has plumped up my wrinkles like no other cream
before i apply concealer around my eyes
it was this eye cream
best eye cream i've used.
using this daily will completely eliminate having to use any concealer
my concealer looks incredibly smooth
it's one of the better eye creams i have used.
can be worn under concealer without caking
i love this eye cream.
really like this eye cream.
when i use this cream
one of the best eye creams i've tried so far!!
it allows me to apply my cream concealer well without creasing
my concealer doesn't crease with this eye cream.
got an idea to use 2 eye creams at the same time
i also use this cream as a neck moisturizer
it is a very good moisturizer
this is the best eye cream i have used.
i love this eye cream!
this is the best moisturizer i always wake up with plump
i cannot say enough about this wonderful nighttime moisturizer
i found that using the 3-step moisturizer along with this is too much for my skin
then i apply the moisturizer mask
other spots gone because my skin is so supple from the moisturizer mask
it's a nice tick layer of lotion
it has the texture of a regular lotion
this lotion doesn't irritate
i love that it isn't quite as heavy as other night-time moisturizers
just use a normal moisturizer
i cannot go without a moisturizer ever.
sometimes i use this as my night moisturizer
sometimes i use it over my regular moisturizer
have tried many moisturizers
this moisturizer saved my skin!
it doesn't wear off like other night moisturizers do
it was more of a heavy moisturizer than justa mask
one day i used my friends daily moisturizer just to try it out
after my beauty regimen i finish with this
so this is like a miracle moisturizer to me
there are better moisturizers that will both moisturize your face
it is the most hydrating moisturizer i have used that will not break me out or worsen acne
i do switch back to this moisturizer until my acne clears up
tend to use it as my nighttime moisturizer
it definitely works well for those who have combination skin when used as a nightly moisturizer
i actually use this every night as my moisturizer as it is moderately priced compared with other intensive moisturizers
i treat it as my overnight moisturizer
it's just slightly thicker than what a regular moisturizer feels like
i love that it directs you to massage it into your skin -- sometimes patting moisturizers on just doesn't feel h
one of the best mask/night cream in sephora
night creams usually are
use an eye cream instead?
this moisturizer has been amazing!
i no longer have to exfoliate my skin before applying my foundation
this is a holy grail moisturizer for me!
needed to get something extra moisturizing when i started accutane
this night cream is the "cream of the crop" !
it is one of the best moisturizers / wrinkle diminishers on the current market
i look forward to applying this moisturizer every night
it's made my skin feel much more moisturizer
this stuff makes me want to return to my old moisturizer
i slather it on
followed with my usual night moisturizer
love this lotion and the boscia brand in general.
fantastic prep for my moisturizer.
now i don't have to go to my facials every two weeks
i applied a bit of moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer for my sensitive
this is a really great nighttime moisturizer.
it's an excellent night moisturizer.
this moisturizer works great
i love this moisturizer.
like any other moisturizer
it also doesn't burn my eyes like the boscia night moisturizer did
this is the only everyday moisturizer that i use
i love applying this moisturizer
my next search will be to find a night tightening moisturizer
it's a nice moisturizer at night
which is how other overnight moisturizers feel to me
perfect night time moisturizer
i've found it works great for me as a daily moisturizer
i love this moisturizer from boscia!
i cannot live without this moisturizer!
the moisturizer worked well
i've used a lot of night moisturizer
it is a night cream
i love this night moisturizer
this is a non-greasy moisturizer
i really like this night cream.
i really love the consistency of this night time moisturizer
this night moisturizer is so amazing!
most moisturizer goes in
have yet to find a moisturizer that does that!
i forgo eye cream when i use this since it's that moisturizing
really seems to be an excellent nighttime moisturizer
i actually don't wear moisturizer at night.
my new night regimen is the boscia tsubaki oil mixed with this night cream
unfortunately this moisturizer just didn't work for me
i see another review stating this moisturizer irritated their skin
i typically like a heavy nighttime moisturizer
this moisturizer works very well without being very heavy
this moisturizer is everything i am looking in a preventative night cream
very pleased with this moisturizer.
night time boscia moisturizer is great for dry skin in those cold months
i typically use biotherm's aquasource as my lotion
this moisturizer has made a nice difference in my skin
this overnight moisturizer is a dream
when i use the clear complexion line with this moisturizer at night i wake up with baby soft skin
the holy grail of overnight moisturizers.
after using this moisturizer overnight
my foundation applies beautifully on nights i have used this moisturizer
i just cannot get enough of this moisturizer.
i wouldn't describe this as a moisturizer
it is more like a sunscreen-
nighttime moisturizer is a competitive market.
i love this moisturizer.
a great moisturizer in the morning
it doesn't make my skin super shiny like a lot of other moisturizers with spf does
i love this moisturizer.
its hard to find a lightweight moisturizer with high spf that isn't greasy
i alternate between this and another sunscreen.
i tend to use a serum or other moisturizer with it
this moisturizer goes on great
i've always made sure to wear moisturizer that has at least spf 15 or higher
i love this moisturizer.
i've used this lotion 2 years in a row.
i've tried other sunscreens in an effort to find something i like with a higher spf
i keep going back to this because most other sunscreens are chalky
i love this moisturizer.
less irrated since switching this moisturizer
this is the only spf moisturizer i've tried that doesn't irritate my skin
i want to try more boscia products after using this moisturizer
so for those who prefer their daily moisturizer with a pleasant fragrance
this is the daily moisturizer i've been waiting for
this one is the perfect moisturizer with the protection i want
definialtly up there with top sunscreens
i am a sunscreen freak
recently tried a sample of this moisturizer
i've used the super-charge overnight as my daily moisturizer because it works so well to nourish my dry patches
use another moisturizer under make up my foundation is not nearly as flawless
its not a mattifying moisturizer
this is the best sunscreen/moisturizer i've ever used
i've used basically every sunscreen on the market
it's a great moisturizer and is spf 30!
this product truly is a sunscreen
this is a good daily moisturizer for me.
this moisturizer isn't heavy
this is a light moisturizer with great spf 30 protection
always have to use a matte finishing powder
i love that the moisturizer is non greasy
this am moisturizer is runny
this is a good basic moisturizer.
this is the only moisturizer i will use.
i love this moisturizer for so many reasons
moisturizer did for me
it took me forever to find the perfect moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
daily moisturizer with at leas an spf of 15
this is my new favorite day lotion.
this is the first lotion with spf that i have like
this is a great daily moisturizer.
this moisturizer is super lightweight so my skin doesn't feel heavy with product when i layer it under makeup
this is a wonderful moisturizer for every day use
it is a definite anti aging lotion.
some spf moisturizers can be too thick
great moisturizer that doesn't leave my face feeling slick like some thicker sunscreen-based moisturizers
felt more like regular moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
though i'd suggest using a primer before any kind of moisturizing foundation
this moisturizer works on every level
i am in the market for a new moisturizer
it goes on like a light moisturizer
i used the regular moisturizer with spf 15 by boscia
i tried the oil-free moisturizer with spf 15 by boscia
i even think if you don't like very fragrant moisturizers
this is a great sunscreen to wear everyday.
this has to be the only sunscreen that not only stays matte for hours
this product actually feels more like a moisturizer
any moisturizer containing spf makes me break out
i do wear another gel moisturizer under because my skin gets a little dry
can burn if i don't use sunscreen
the lighter 15 spf in the summer
does not smell like sunscreen.
this moisturizer is working perfectly for me--light
this lotion is really thin but it works for me.
this is enough of a moisturizer for day
i like the texture of the moisturizer
this product is smaller than other moisturizers
this sunscreen is great.
i only need one pump to moisturizer
this is the only sunscreen it has done this with
i do think this is a great moisturizer
i needed a daily spf lotion
while not an intensive moisturizer
this is the moisturizer i have been searching for
many times the higher the sunscreen
greasy the moisturizer can be
i love this face cream
absurbs the way face cream should
this is not an intensive moisturizer.
easy lotion which provides spf 30 coverage
this is a fantastic multi-purpose moisturizer!
then your moisturizer only if you need additional hydration
mix a couple of drops in my moisturizer in the morning
a drop mixed with my daytime spf moisturizer is fine
only a few moisturizers came up
this moisturizer is one of the very few that does not give me breakouts
this moisturizer is fantastic.
you'll love this moisturizer
i found a moisturizer that mattifies
i love this moisturizer.
love that they have a moisturizer that's oil free
this is great moisturizer.
i tried this moisturizer on a whim
trying to find an every day moisturizer that worked for my constantly dry skin
i couldn't find a moisturizer that worked perfect under makeup for my dry skin
my holy grail every day moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer!
i highly recommend this moisturizer for those who have dry/combo skin
i really like this moisturizer.
straight up, this moisturizer i will forever buy.
this moisturizer addressed all three things.
'm new to the nars skincare line
if your on the fence about this moisturizer
after those layers i use a different moisturizer on top
was recommended that i use this along with the moisturizer
i wasn't a fan of the moisturizer
i tried the serum with my usual moisturizer
the way i use this product is in conjunction with my regular moisturizer
i apply moisturizer or sleeping mask
i've gone through so many moisturizers
yet i keep it under my tinted moisturizer
you can use it as a substitute for a moisturizer in the morning or a night gel at night
the one thing i will say is that this is a great product for your daily moisturizing routine
this is my holy grail moisturizer.
this moisturizer changed my skin.
this cream is pricey
has a long lasting moisturizer
i apply this to my face right before applying lotion
this is one pricey moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer if you are like me
this cream is not oily at all
i add this to my moisturizer every night for an extra boost of hydration
follow up with my regular moisturizer
moisturizer without being heavy
i can never find a moisturizer/cream that works
i mix a little bit of this with whatever moisturizer i'm using
some evenings i will mix it with my moisturizer
i usually mix an oil with my moisturizer or serum at night
i've also used it a few times in place of a moisturizer
blends well with my other moisturizer
i mix it with my moisturizer or foundation
i recommend this product to anyone who needs a new oil moisturizer
it has done wonders for my skincare
this is one of my favorite moisturizers.
i just put two drops in with my night moisturizer or serum
i add 4 drops to 1 pump of my moisturizer
i can see this being in my skincare routine for a long time
then top with a light moisturizer
in the am i mix a few drops in with moisturizer in my palm
i am never buying another facial moisturizer again
i mix 3 drops with my moisturizer in the am
love it and will buy the exfoliating powder next!
i mix about 3 drops with my bobbie brown moisturizer
i'll use the oil alone on top of my moisturizer
i've used it on its own as a day moisturizer
at night with or over my creams
i like to mix a drop or two of oil with my moisturizer in the morning
i wear this under the pomegranate moisturizer from korres
tinted moisturizer or full foundation
it takes away mascara
the origins mascara is great
honestly this is almost the best serums i've ever used
decided to look for a moisturizer from the company as well
after one day of using the gel cream
it's more the consistency of a very thin lotion
i can't imagine my skincare routine without this product
i like how this moisturizer gets absorbed super quickly
i recently purchased this because i needed a new moisturizer
this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling so soft
this is one of my favorite moisturizers.
break out with most moisturizers
the skin care lady put this moisturizer on my cheeks
i just haven't found any other daily moisturizer that is hydrating enough
i'd use it as lotion for my h
only add additional moisturizer depending on how my skin is looking
i need a moisturizer to protect my face from the sun
it moisturizers the skin all in one
my favorite moisturizer and it smells so good!
i love that this gel moisturizer keeps my skin cool
i love this as a very natural moisturizer.
this moisturizer is simply wonderful
i am pretty basic with my skincare routine
it is a very nice moisturizer that is not sticky
this moisturizer works really well in my normal/combo skin
if you want a light weight moisturizer that doesn't leave your skin oily this is for you
i do like this moisturizer
this is my go-to daily moisturizer – beautiful fragrance
i've tried just about every moisturizer on the market
i absolutely love this gel moisturizer.
every moisturizer on the market it feels like.
that's how i end up on a hunt for a new moisturizer
that being said, it is a really nice gel lotion.
i hate all moisturizers that are too heavy
leave a greasy feeling on your skin so this is the perfect moisturizer for me
this is the perfect nighttime moisturizer for summer
this moisturizer doesn't make me break out
i love this gel cream.
i never used moisturizer
during the day a sunscreen on top of that
the moisturizer sits well under my makeup
this moisturizer does both!
this is an excellent, lightweight moisturizer.
i find that this moisturizer works excellently
except you don't need a moisturizer after it
the absolute best face moisturizer i have ever used
this is a must for every skincare regimen!
i used a sample of this rather than my usual moisturizer
i would still consider using this moisturizer for my oily skin because i use oil controlling makeup
i ordered the gel cream
i don't think people realize that a serum is meant to be used before your normal moisturizer as a boost to your routine because serum penetrates the dermis deeper than a cream
love the gel formula, feels great on the skin.
i wouldn't use this for heavy duty moisturizing though
tried so many moisturizers
for me, this gel is perfect as a day cream.
this moisturizer calms the red down
it would also be great as an every day moisturizer
i will never use a different moisturizer.
this gel moisturizer is perfect for hot weather.
this is a good moisturizer.
this is my nighttime moisturizer
use it as night lotion
i used the fresh clay moisturizer before which was great
this moisturizer works excellent for my skin
i love that this moisturizer from fresh comes in a pump
yet i needed a moisturizer
this is absolutely my favorite moisturizer
then the day moisturizer with the spf 20 i was excited
use this underneath my heavier daytime moisturizer
at night underneath the lotus moisturizer
when you combine a thin layer with your daily moisturizer
as well as removing my concealer
i love slathering my face with this
i don't even need to use a lot of moisturizer.
even takes of my mascara
especially for long-wear mascara
my cheeks needing extra moisturizer because of the dry weather
i do not use a moisturizer with this product.
when literally every other moisturizer burns my skin
this moisturizer is worth it.
you can mix this product with a moisturizer to create a tinted cream
highly recommended as an overnight moisturizer
this brightens and moisturizers the best.
then i finish with a moisturizer to seal the oil
forgot to pack my moisturizer during a trip
also this is not a moisturizer
i mix one drop of this in with my moisturizer
the every day skin massage keeps my face looking great
if you leave this one as your last skincare item
because moisturizers should go on afterwards
i am going to try using my clinique moisturizer after
5 pump to my night time moisturizer
this is a must-have in my beauty regimen.
i've used it as a moisturizer on days when i don't wear makeup
follow with moisturizer in drier areas of my face
it layers nicely under my moisturizer
i just recently purchased a tinted moisturizer because my skin has improved so much
i add 1 little pump into my daytime moisturizer
besides using sunscreen everyday
couldn't find a sufficient moisturizer to use during the day
so i seldom use concealer on my eye areas.
best eye cream ever!
went back to some lighter eye creams i'd been using before buying the wrinkle resist
i love this eye cream.
just purchased my third bottle of this eye cream.
i love this eye cream
concealers will help hide my circles
now my concealer goes on well
this is the best eye cream i've found.
believe me i would put this in the miracle creams
love this eye cream!
absolutely one of my favorite moisturizers.
it even works great during the day under concealer
quality skin type appropriate moisturizer
i decided to try this cream
of course- this isn't botox
that easily corrected with concealer
this eye cream seems to be another quality skincare product from shiseido
the eye cream works well under concealer.
are cheaper eye creams
i still can use this eye cream
eye creams is where you splurge
also-- when i use this just prior to my concealer
while not a miracle cream
i love this eye cream!
at first i thought this is a crazy expensive cuticle cream
it seems to work better over a serum or cream.
definitely need a moisturizer with it.
to fix that i usually mix 1/2 of this product with 1/2 of my regular face moisturizer
my only issue with it is that i need to put moisturizer
i do not like tanning and woke up super streaky.
it recommends you put moisturizer on top of it
this one of my favorite moisturizers!
i love this moisturizer!
perfect timing because i needed a new moisturizer
when i use this moisturizer
this is a good, lightweight moisturizer.
i do notice a few more breakouts when using this moisturizer daily
wasimmediately impressed with the consistency of the moisturizer
if you are familiar with gel moisturizers
it also works as a primer for my concealer
i am absolutely in love with this moisturizer
highly recommend this moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
i love a gel moisturizer
i wouldn't use this moisturizer
i just love this moisturizer.
that's why i would consider this a "basic" moisturizer
this moisturizer smells great!!
the moisturizer was great for my skin!
while this moisturizer is so said to be gel
this moisturizer is lightweight
the origins ginzing energy-boosting gel moisturizer was very pleasant to use every morning
you definitely get your money's worth with this moisturizer
i received this moisturizer from influenster's for my honest review
this moisturizer is light weight
it's great on days when i just need a moisturizing pick-me-up
this moisturizer is perfect for the summer since it is light weight
it keeps me moisturizer all day
i really love this moisturizer.
i loved the moisturizer.
now i am normally not a fan of gel moisturizers
i think i found my new daily moisturizer!
i find it to be a lightweight moisturizer on the skin
i actually find that i don't need to add any oils to this moisturizer to get it to leave my skin looking glowy as i have to do with some of my other moisturizers
this moisturizer is quite light and fresh!
i found this moisturizer to be lightweight
i like the light weight texture of this moisturizer
which is always what i look for in a moisturizer
honestly it is a great moisturizer
i love that this moisturizer is lightweight
after using the eye cream with this moisturizer in the morning the only i definitely felt a change in skin on my face
it's not sticky like a lot of other moisturizer
i love this lightweight moisturizer
i would definitely recommend this moisturizer for those with combination or acne prone skin
normally moisturizers make my face too oily
i feel like my face is moisturizer
i would definitely recommend this moisturizer that helps my skin feel so refreshed
i really like this moisturizer
it's a great everyday morning moisturizer
this moisturizer was fantastic !
it's actually a very good moisturizer for all skin types
i usually don't like trying out new moisturizers
my new go to moisturizer :)
this moisturizer is great!
this gel moisturizer was part of that set
its the perfect moisturizer for my entire face.
am always nervous to try new moisturizers
i love this moisturizer!
a daily moisturizer lacking spf means i must apply a 2nd product
i've stuck with the same moisturizer for years now
thin moisturizer so a lot goes a long way!
some moisturizers leave me greasy waking up in the morning
the moisturizers i've used before are pretty clear in color
i changed foundation, mascara, bronzer.
saw a makeup tutorial thag said to us a gel moisterizer cause the cream one will make your skin oily
i like this moisturizer in the morning
i wish it had spf because i really like that my usual morning moisturizer does
this moisturizer is light weight
this is one of the first moisturizers that i've ever used that worked for it
i love this cream!
i love this moisturizer!
this gel moisturizer does exactly what it claims!
the first thing that i noticed about this gel moisturizer was the texture
feels to me like the laneige sleeping pack moisturizer
at night as i like a lightweight moisturizer most of the time
this would be a lovely moisturizer to use prior to makeup applications
i don't even wear highlighter
i truly believe it's because of this moisturizer
t's perfect for an everyday moisturizer
one of my favorite moisturizers to date
this is a great lightweight moisturizer!
this moisturizer is very good
this moisturizer smells amazing!
i love this moisturizer!!
just enough without the heaviness of some other moisturizers
immediately feels plumping which is not something i've ever really thought about a moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer.
lancer spf is my favorite morning moisturizer
this is the best smelling moisturizer ever!
like every other moisturizer i use
it keeps me feeling moisturizer all day.
this moisturizer is quickly becoming my favorite.
this lotion does not do this at all.
one of my favorite moisturizers!
i really really enjoy this moisturizer!
i think this is a perfect moisturizer for me
loving this new moisturizer!
this moisturizer smells amazing!
i really liked using this moisturizer.
looks with this moisturizer on
this stuff is fantastic for a night-time moisturizer
gives your face a very moisturizer look
the moisturizer is gel based
this moisturizer feels like no other
it's more like the perfect blend of any normal moisturizer
i would highly recommend this moisturizer!
probably the best moisturizer i have ever used!
i really liked this moisturizer.
i absolutely love how lightweight this moisturizer is
this moisturizer is delicious
i really like this moisturizer.
the fact that it's a gel moisturizer is actually really nice
when i started using this gel cream
this is a great every day moisturizer.
not an intense moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
i really love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is light weight which means that it absorbs quickly
feel like most moisturizers make me look greasy
the moisturizer feels great i automatically feel rejuivnized
add on more sunscreen lotion on my face
this moisturizer is heaven.
whether it be creams
i can honestly say i genuinely love this gel moisturizer
this moisturizer feels really good on my face i love that's a gel moisturizer because i have combination skin it feels moisturize my skin it doesn't feel oily at all
my skin does feel brighter after using it as a moisturizer for night
was a bit nervous to try this moisturizer
at first i was bit skeptical of trying out a new moisturizer
i really loved this gel moisturizer by origins.
i noticed my face makeup went on way smoother with this moisturizer
i like using this as a day time moisturizer to wake my skin up
i love this moisturizer.
my moisturizer with spf leaves a little shine
i don't use any foundation or tinted moisturizers
the formula feels like a light moisturizer going on
i like this moisturizer
but, it is not an anti- wrinkle cream.
if i had to chose one moisturizer to use for the rest of my life
i got this cream in a discounted gift set with the renergie eye cream
this is the moisturizer for you
this cream has been perfect
for 3+ years i've been using neutrogena as a moisturizer
never think to use sunscreen so having it built into my daily moisturizer is perfect
i only use it at night under moisturizer.
better to start earlier than later with retinol serums
sometimes i put a moisturizer over it
especially if you would like to try a retinol product
when used in conjunction with a really good moisturizer of your choice
retinol aside this product has a lot of great stuff for your skin
i added this to my neck cream
the only skincare product that i use more of is moisturizer because my skin is so dry that i have to
will continue to use as like how it works with the genius moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer
though i do use a moisturizer on top
paired with moisturizer this is the bomb
at night i use their skin cream
thought it was time i invest in my skincare routine
retinol was one of them
just remember to wear a sunscreen when using retinol
genius cream after applying the firming
after showing me how to apply the concealer
the lifting eye cream
i still use my moisturizer with it
i can get away with a tinted sunscreen
i won't even need concealer if this continues
don't let water touch retinol
it does everything the regular serum did with the added benefit of retinol
lifting cream or the algenist anti-aging moisturizer
we have all used moisturizers
i am for going the botox appointment
moisturizer user for years
i used it only at night since it has the retinol
with the sunscreen at a younger age
still love other serums for my face: clarins
then apply moisturizer after
i just ordered their moisturizer
it is not this cream
i tried the daily moisturizer
one of the best moisturizers i've ever tried.
when i look for a summertime moisturizer
this moisturizer was a godsend!!!
i love this cream.
this is a fantastic night time moisturizer for all skin types
this is the only moisturizer i use.
this product is a miracle cream.
during the day under my foundation or bronzing powder
i really like this moisturizer
i love this night cream!
s down the best moisturizer i've used
this is my favorite night cream ever i wake up to the most moisturized
i love the cream
my favorite moisturizer of all time!
i find it is an excellent night time moisturizer over my serum
this is a quality overnight moisturizer
doesn't feel heavy under nighttime lotion.
i tried many different moisturizers
i just might try the regular moisturizer in this line it has no spf
better than any moisturizer i've ever tried.
just a great all around night time moisturizer.
it is a very good moisturizer
but the lotion is great!
this product is basically a moisturizer
this is the best face cream.
i still use my moisturizer on top of the application of lotus oil
i've tried absolutely every moisturizer
i changed nothing else in my diet or skincare regimen
put my moisturizer over top
excellent moisturizer with a superb spf.
i left with a new moisturizer
i will add now that i only exfoliate
2 drops with my murad skin perfecting lotion
use 4-7 drops alone or mixed in with your moisturizer
i read an article on face oil recently saying that rosemary oil was good for acne prone skin
using a cream moisturizer has always made my skin very oily throughout the day
follow with my clarin's night cream for combo skin
i don't even need moisturizer in summer at night
i put it over my serum and moisturizer.
use a sunscreen during the day
i realize that any quality moisturizer for older
this cream was like a miracle in a jar
the sunscreen factor is so nice
this moisturizer is perfect in every way.
love love love this moisturizer!
almost works like a primer as well as a moisturizer
this moisturizer is h
s down one of the best with sunscreen
this is a geat day spf cream which makes my skin glow
get the awful taste of sunscreen or headache from the smell like other spf moisturizers
low for a moisturizer with minimum spf 30
plus it has sunscreen.
other spf moisturizers i tried left my skin sticky or oily
this moisturizer with spf is really great for no-makeup days
i definitely would not recommend using this as a moisturizer under makeup
this is my all time fav moisturizer.
i love the light-weight coverage the sunscreen in this product provides
i rarely wear anything over my moisturizer
just a little bit of bronzer
this is 1 of the best moisturizers i have used.
this is a great spf daily moisturizer.
i love this cream
the reason i like this moisturizer is because it absorbs quickly
best moisturizer i have ever used
my makeup goes on evenly with this moisturizer as well
with sunscreen that i am not allergic to
i recommend it for any warm vacation spot to replace your usual daily moisturize
this is by far the best moisturizer with spf i've tried
used an oil free moisturizer from neutrogena
a great moisturizer that took care of dry to normal areas
i love using this to moisturize right before i put on my makeup
my go-to moisturizer --- love everything about it it
does not have a sunscreen smell.
becoming more paranoid about sun exposure i wanted to switch out my dramatically different moisturizer in the morning for a moisturizer with spf
if i even open a bottle of sunscreen
is the first sunscreen that doesn't make my acne worse
it is the lightest weight sunscreen i have ever tried
which never happens with other sunscreens
i've known for a while that sunscreen is a must
have had a hard time finding a moisturizer
i typically cannot wear mineral-only sunscreens on my face
this is my hg daily moisturizer
i tried face finishing moisturizer tint which was very heavy on my face
i am used to a thicker moisturizer.
love this because i wanted something that was moisturizing
face finishing moisturizer at night
i really like this product for an every day moisturizer
it's a good light to medium moisturizer.
doesn't make my makeup slide off like a lot of sunscreen moisturizers have in the past
i am loving this moisturizer for every day.
normally i can go with just a tinted moisturizer
i'll continue to use my current spf moisturizer instead of this one
will go back to layering ffm with a sunscreen
after about 3 months of using this great sunscreen
i just love this moisturizer with spf 30.
the texture of the moisturizer is nice
the world's most perfect anti-aging moisturizer with spf
you notice it's different from other moisturizers
this sunscreen is wonderful
what works best for me is lightly misting my skin with evian immediately before application
i actually thought it was a mattifying moisturizer
sensitive skin that breaks out with many sunscreen products
i love the fact that it is a working anti-aging moisturizer
this is probably the best moisturizer with spf 30 that i have ever used
does not have that "sunscreen" thickness or scent
i usually used clarins spf 40 face lotion
i prefer the face finishing moisturizer over this one
this cream is light
wear on top of my sephora moisturizer
such as the lancôme spf 15 moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer when i need some extra moisture
humidity leaves skin glowing which is what this moisturizer does
has been chapping my face even wearing the other sunscreen/moisturizer i was using
love this lightweight moisturizer!
a very light hint of sunscreen
as it seems to be a great sunscreen
more moisturizing than when i actually bought it
leave you looking dewey type moisturizer
this is the first sunscreen that doesn't irritate my skin
i'd been trying lots of day moisturizers with sunscreen
this is just the loveliest spf sunscreen i have ever tried
feel of regular sunscreen on your face
the feel of this cream is like a mousse
nothing out of the ordinary compared with other sunscreen creams i have tried
apply under moisturizer am
i don't feel the need to follow with a moisturizer
it's not a moisturizer though
put the clinique gel moisturizer on after
i don't even need moisturizer
you get an eye cream
finding that perfect eyeliner
i think this serum also helps my face cream absorb better
it's one of my favorite parts of my routine- i feel like i'm pampering myself when i put it on before moisturizer
i am a pretty big fan of serums
i put this serum before using my favorite lotion
i think it helps the moisturizer to absorb even more
i would definitely recommend this cream
on top of my moisturizer
i tell them skincare is the first step to gorgeous
have been loving layering this over my moisturizer usually at night
next i need to invest in a moisturizer from this line
have a multivitamin in an oil form for my skin
over all i fell like it helped moisturize my skin
in the instructions it actually said to apply oil on top of the moisturizer
sometimes i put it under my moisturizer
while heavy creams are not good for my oily skin
going into the winter i am adding a moisturizer
rebuilding moisturizer is excellent for combination skin
this moisturizer is lightweight
this is the best moisturizer i've tried- tata is the best
this moisturizer is great.
have a very hard time finding a good moisturizer
having searched for decades for the perfect moisturizer -first for adult acne
i really like this moisturizer for daytime.
i trust her with my life when it comes to skincare
followed by my normal moisturizers
i apply my regular serum or moisturizer
i'll finish my current moisturizer while thinking about getting this one
absolutely love this moisturizer.
this is a wonderful moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
i love this lotion!
this moisturizer is not only safe
just bought this moisturizer the other day
great moisturizer doesn't have that petroleum based feel
i used this moisturizer for two weeks now
moisturizers for combination skin don't do enough
i am a fan of this moisturizer.
especially amazing when paired with the moisturizer
do your research when picking up a good exfoliator
you want a gentle daily exfoliator
i often just concentrate on moisturizers
maybe not all of my mascara
smell is actually really important to me because i like to have a "spa like" experience with my skincare routine
ready to accept the rest of my skincare regimen
who told me you don't need to exfoliate daily
this is a great almost-daily exfoliator.
kind of feels like you are washing your face with a lotion
i need more from my skincare line the older i get
i've used this in combination with the repairing moisturizer for a month now
i need more from my skincare the older i get
leaves a perfect foundation for moisturizer
this serum is the most impressive skincare product that i've tried in ages
especially if i add one of the moisturizers on top
this under the repairative moisturizer one night
concealer can't even fully cover my blue circles.
a bit of my nars concealer makes me always look rested
a little concealer after that
has lotion like feel to it
i found the lotion to be more like a light gel texture
his creams are amazing
this cream is amazing
i mix a small amount of nars foundation to create a tinted moisturizer for daily use
i wanted a moisturizer that was light enough for daytime use for my combination skin
i am super picky when it comes to moisturizer
in the past i have had issues with gel moisturizers flaking once i put makeup on
this moisturizer it's great.
i love this moisturizer.
this is my best moisturizer.
moisturizer for my face that i could apply over my serums
this is now my favourite part of my skincare routine
you do need a good moisturizer as it is a little drying
step up your moisturizer
i really enjoy using this moisturizer for daily use
this is a great moisturizer
the balancing moisturizer at night
i cannot believe this moisturizer has a few bad reviews
when my skin is oily i alternate to this moisturizer
i love that this moisturizer doesn't make my skin look shiny
i needed a moisturizer that wouldn't inflame my skin
this lightweight product is the perfect daytime moisturizer
this moisturizer is my favorite!
i break out easily with face moisturizers.
this was honestly the best moisturizer for my skin
i tried others moisturizers
moisturizer in this line
overall i think this is a fairly good moisturizer
i really wanted to add an spf lotion to my beauty regimen
this lotion is pretty close to perfect
to my face cream in am
during the day under my moisturizer
i tried so many different moisturizers
definitely use a moisturizer on top.
great moisturizer for those of use with combo skin
doesn't make my skin oily and great moisturizer.
works the best when using the lotion with it
i found that i generally prefer the texture of a lightweight moisturizer
i put a drop or two into my am moisturizer
into my pm moisturizer
i think this product is a great product to mix in with you moisturizer for that subtle glow :
less likely to need to pack on a super thick am moisturizer
i can't wear moisturizer on top of this though
this cream has done miracles on his dry skin
i've tried layering over several serums hoping it would work
so now i use it at night alone under a moisturizer
mixed a few drops with my daytime moisturizer which helped reduce the aged
no moisturizer with it when i need to calm down my skin
you can usually do just as well moisturizing with products like cerave
i mix a few drops in with my regular moisturizer.
i also tried it over an spf moisturizer
apply tinted moisturizer in the morning
or i'll add one drop into my regular moisturizer
i just started using ole henriksen's truth serum on other nights under my nighttime moisturizer
every night i mix the serum with my nighttime moisturizer
do not use any additional moisturizer
i do love the algenist eye balm
i've added it to the rotation of moisturizers
i mix a few drops with my moisturizer morning
i put a bit of moisturizer in my palm
i put 2 drops in with my moisturizer before i apply it to make it creamier
i add two drops of it to my moisturizer
i don't need to use moisturizer as often
use a more lightweight oil control moisturizer in the morning
very ready for my nighttime moisturizer
so skincare at this age is one of my top grooming priorities
this product has proven itself as a moisturizer
i went to sephora to buy my regular moisturizer
during the day with my moisturizer on top
the oils that don't leave a film on my skin usually aren't moisturizing enough for me
it has a healthy glow that can be seen at 100% when used with a moisturizer
sunscreen to keep it bulletproof
then apply a hyaluronic acid moisturizer
daily sunscreen- clinique super city block
i apply extra lotion afterwards
this is one of my favorite serums.
this pairs well with any moisturizer
i don't wear a moisturizer at night anymore
the combination of my skin regimen
i started applying this serum under my moisturizer before bed
after using this i have realized that i no longer need to use foundation or concealer
i recommend this serum in combination with the estee lauder anti aging moisturizer
it helps my moisturizer to sink in
please note that this is -not- a moisturizer
it is a serum you use before your moisturizer
i wear this under my night time moisturizer.
would burn when i put moisturizer on
i mix two drops of this serum with my pm moisturizer
moisturizers as it helps those products work better
then also this morning before my moisturizer
it means you need to use lotion or cream after as a finish
you need to add lotion or cream to lock it in
felt like i needed to up my skincare game
it goes under your normal skin care creams morning
terrific serum to use daily under moisturizer.
my moisturizer goes on flawlessly over this.
it is now a part of my everyday skin regimen
it's best not to expose your skincare to light
when another skincare line discontinued the moisturizer with spf that i used for daily wear
i love this moisturizer.
s down the best moisturizer i've ever tried
time trying to find the perfect face lotion
this lotion leave absolutely no greasy film
which has been a big issue for me searching for a lotion
the combo of this moisturizer followed by covergirl 3-1 foundation
plus i have some sunscreen!
this creme would be perfect for anyone with dry skin or who wears powder foundation
i like this moisturizer
it is basically my sunscreen for every day use also
this is my absolutely favorite moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer.
i absolutely love this moisturizer because it is perfect for my oily-combination skin
i love this moisturizer!
great moisturizer for skincare esteelauder cannot go wrong with trying with the product
plus, it has sunscreen and smells good!
i love this moisturizer!
this will always be one of my favorite moisturizers
it can be on the thicker side for moisturizers
this is my go-to moisturizer especially in the summer
not the cheapest moisturizer out there
i love this moisturizer under makeup
the moisturizer its amazing too
i pile this moisturizer on my face
this is very very similar to lancome spf30 sunscreen
all around a great moisturizer with wonderful anti-aging benefits
i really love this moisturizer
always come back to this moisturizer
it provides me with the right amount of moisturizer all over
i like this gel
've had some awful experiences with moisturizers
he suggested i start using a moisturizer
this is probably the only moisturizer that didn't make me oily
it's the best gel type moisturizer i've used for my skin type
then this miracle moisturizer
i love this cream.
found this neck cream with an spf
this is a great moisturizer!
it has become my fave moisturizer of the moment
i would try different moisturizers
i'll use it as a nightly skin treatment under moisturizer
in fact i don't even wear concealer anymore
use it enderneath the eye cream.
the eye cream alone
sometimes i use under my concealer during the day if i feel like i am dry
i love this eye cream
this is my ultimate favourite eye cream
love this eye cream!!
great night moisturizer for eye area.
at least my concealer goes on much smoother now
this eye cream definitely is one of estee lauder's best products
it has more of a gel consistency than a lotion.
this is a great eye cream!
my concealer also applies better
i followed up this product with a sample of the refining moisturizer
every night i leave it on for 3-5mins to really moisturize my face
first moisturizer that hasn't left my skin feel oily
she likes this light, yet effective moisturizer.
i mix it during the day with the josie maran moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer i use daily
many moisturizers that just did not work out
works better than any other moisturizer i've tried
helps boost the moisturizer underneath.
concealer under my eyes
this is the only moisturizer that doesn't break out my very acne prone face
i team it up with my body lotion
i combine it with my night cream or body lotion
this honestly moisturizes me more than regular moisturizer under my makeup
it's the perfect daytime moisturizer.
this is the first moisturizer i've ever found that actually moisturizes without causing me to breakout
recently got the light oil to use as a day moisturizer under my makeup
it's a great moisturizer for all seasons
i massage my skin with this and i love it!
i apply it all over my body after another moisturizer for a smooth finish
this works wonders as a daily moisturizer
i can wear this over lightweight moisturizer
i even add a drop to my moisturizer at night.
it is a very good moisturizer!
no other moisturizer needed!
i'll use it to moisturize by itself or drop a drop into my moisturizer
this works well on hair if you mix a few drops in with a leave in conditioner for added shine
it moisturizers and doesn't make me break out.
so for years i've been searching for a good moisturizer to use on my face
this is my go to moisturizer now.
i add a drop or two to my moisturizer when my face is especially dry
add a few drops to my body lotion to add extra hydration when i need it
i tried the expensive night cream
it's a great oil/moisturizer
so this stuff lasts way longer than a typical moisturizer
i can slather it on
have used this product >10 years as my facial moisturizer
as a moisturizer before i apply my makeup
i started off using it as a nighttime moisturizer
i don't even use foundation or concealer anymore
thought it might be time to add this to my skincare routine
with my moisturizer i mixed 1-2 drops of the oil
it is my moisturizer
this moisturizer does the trick
i've since switched to it as my go to daily moisturizer
i own the daily vitamin lotion which is great
this ren product was the best money i've spent on skincare
the bio retinoid moisturizer feels great on your face
i am quite picky about so called "anti-aging" creams
the clarins anti-aging sunscreen
it is a great moisturizer though
'm now using it twice a week with another moisturizer
this is great for taking off waterproof mascara
not exfoliating enough for me to exclusively on the day to day
taking off mascara has always been a challenge for me
gets almost all of the most stubborn mascara
wonderful for removing matte lipstick.
preps it for my moisturizers
even my waterproof mascara
i even use less moisturizer.
my daily moisturizer goes over it just fine
note: if you have a heavy-duty mascara or waterproof eye makeup
only downside is that it does not really remove waterproof mascara
moisturizer sink in better
i welcome the emollient finish i get after using this product
i love this moisturizer so much.
including my waterproof mascara
not so great with waterproof mascara
i wake up the next day with soft moisturizer skin
skin so dry that my makeup would flake in spite of using crème ancienne at night
crème ancienne soft cream in the morning
for those of you who don't mind splurging on a beautiful addition to your skincare routine/ritual u will be forever happy with your purchase
in addition to regular moisturizer
moisturizer without any dryness
when i put my moisturizer on afterwards
it's by far the best moisturizer i have ever used
this is my go to moisturizer.
try this moisturizer out because it will change your skin for the better
this moisturizer is the greatest!
other moisturizers dry out after like minutes.
i absolutely adore this moisturizer as it suits my skin type perfectly
it is a pretty heavy moisturizer
this is my daily moisturizer.
this moisturizer is the bomb!!
i recommend you the 'gel' version of this moisturizer
i finally found the perfect moisturizer
i like heavier moisturizers for nighttime
this is definitely a staple in my skincare routine
my favorite moisturizer in the world!
ive been use the same moisturizer
my skin would be so oily when id first apply the lotion
i would like it to have sunscreen
i love this lotion
i started using this moisturizer
i just need a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out
i am committed to this moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer i've tried h
before this moisturizers i tried 4 other higher end ones
this is my holy grail moisturizer
i've heard so many amazing things about this moisturizer
this is the all around moisturizer i always come back to
this lotion made my face feel so soft.
this moisturizer can be worn under a daily spf lotion or days that you're staying home to netflix
this lotion works the best in my opinion
i wear this moisturizer under my primer
this moisturizer is great for dry
this moisturizer is terrific for very dry skin.
i've never spent a lot of money on skincare
i wanted a good moisturizer that didn't feel heavy on the skin
this lotion is perfect
i love this lotion.
i love the consistency of this moisturizer.
i tried this moisturizer in a sample size
it's been the best facial moisturizer i have ever tried for my combination skin
in winter this lotion is really good .
this moisturizer is great for evening it out
before adding an spf moisturizer
i absolutely love this lotion.
the best moisturizer ive used for my dry skin.
the only moisturizer i will use.
i remember going into her bathroom to use this special yellow lotion
this moisturizer takes the cake
great moisturizer, i just wish it had spf!
this has been my go moisturizer for 10 years
i can clearly see a change in my skin with this lotion
it's actually the lotion
not only is it an excellent moisturizer
have used this lotion for months
it's been my favorite moisturizer since--
this moisturizer is really great for the winter if you have extremely dry skin
it also doesn't have a scent which is what bothers me about most moisturizers
the lotion at night
i wasn't a big fan of the thickness of the lotion
even the first night i used this lotion
i love this moisturizer so much for many reasons
overall best moisturizer i used ever used
the best moisturizer ever!
i used clinique moisturizer years ago
i love this moisturizer.
are using too much of your lotion
away the best moisturizer i've ever used
i find the lotion is much more effective than the gel version
the lotion works better at plumping up my entire face
i've gone through so many different moisturizers
switched back to my old moisturizer
i keep coming back to this moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is for dry or combo skin.
this is a great moisturizer if you have dry skin
this is my favorite moisturizer!
so there is no lotion rubbing off on my clothes
i love this moisturizer.
so far it's the best moisturizer i've used!
i need a heavier moisturizer at night for my fine lines
i would consider this more of a brightener
love this eye cream.
i will still purchase again after i finish my other eye creams
works well with my concealer
i wish it was a thicker cream for more moisturization
best eye cream i ever purchased!
because i feel like night creams need to be thicker
i apply this cream
overall i liked this moisturizer-- nothing mind blowing
it was a good basic with spf for my combo skin
this moisturizer from shiseido is a great light weight spf moisturizer
the ibuki refining moisturizer in my opinion is better than this one
i need a moisturizer that is lightweight
this moisturizer is gentle
as many moisturizers with spf can do to my skin
i love this as a daytime moisturizer!
some days i can just use a bit of undereye concealer
the price is reasonable for a good quality moisturizer
so far, this moisturizer is the best one i found.
pretty nice moisturizer tried it as an alternative to my all the time fav by clarins
this moisturizer could be a good substitution
this is a decent day moisturizer
my friend recommend me to try this moisturizer
i love this lightweight daytime lotion!
my summer moisturizer of choice.
i need a thicker moisturizer
one of the few spf moisturizers out there that isn't greasy
this moisturizer is perfect!
this is my favorite day cream
i love this moisturizer!
decided to find a moisturizer with a light spf
this moisturizer is very light
i always need a daily moisturizer with spf in it
this is definitely a solid day-time lotion with sun protection
this lotion doesn't make me shinny
well this moisturizer did the job
i like this lotion a lot
i love the feel of this lotion after putting on my skin
this lotion is light with spf that is appropriate for office
i tried this moisturizer out because of its claim to shrink
the scent is kinda heavy compare to a lot of other moisturizers
this moisturizer is amazing
that's the best part of this moisturizer
skin type: dry afage: 21i love this moisturizer.
this refining moisturizer is wonderful for my skin
i found this moisturizer on a special display at sephora
was confident i'd love this moisturizer
i really love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer keeps my skin happy
the moment i switch to another moisturizer
best moisturizer i've tried in awhile
lotion-y texture for day time- it's not too greasy
this is the second ibuki moisturizer i've used
it smells like sunscreen
one of the few moisturizers i would purchase again
i started using this moisturizer
this is my go-to everyday moisturizer.
i absolutely adore this moisturizer.
this moisturizer goes on lightweight
non-greasy this moisturizer feels
i gave it four stars because i will need a stronger moisturizer for winter
this moisturizer is perfect for every day
i think this lotion
after i started using this lightweight moisturizer people have been giving me compliments left
the moisturizer is great for my combination skin.
the moisturizer costs enough as it is!
even though it's a really light moisturizer
the moisturizer is thin
i love this moisturizer.
i got the moisturizer
got this moisturizer with the $25 gift set
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
the other moisturizer was making my skin freak out
s down the best moisturizer i have ever used
this has been a wonderful moisturizer
i am happy to say that the ibuki moisturizer has helped
i love this moisturizer.
i still think this moisturizer is fantastic for oily/combination skin
i die for this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is everything.
this moisturizer not only gets rid of my dry patches
i love this moisturizer
this moisturizer is a worthy purchase.
very happy with this moisturizer
this moisturizer is amazing for dry skin
this has been my favorite moisturizer
this moisturizer is great.
i always use this moisturizer prior to putting on my foundation
i love this moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer for the dry winter time
this moisturizer is like the moisturizer that just keeps on giving
i got this miracle moisturizer as a sample with my sephora purchase
it's the only moisturizer that makes my skin feel relieved
for me with this moisturizer
super lightweight wear and even has sunscreen!
i find it excellent to use under eye area before i apply under eye concealer
this moisturizer helped me so much!
this lotion can st
this is a great lightweight moisturizer.
recently decided to branch out from my go to neutrogena sensitive skin moisturizer
this is my go to moisturizer when i can afford to splurge
this refining moisturizer + a retinoid is the "cocktail" i've used at night for the last 3 months
also know that i use the ibuki protective moisturizer broad spectrum spf 18 during day
other moisturizers tended to leave a heavy
this is the best light moisturizer i've ever used
this moisturizer is great!
even works out as a great primer for my bronzer
it is the most light weighted moisturizer i used so far
other moisturizer will leave your skin feeling sticky
it is a thinner moisturizer
i will never use another moisturizer again.
i've always had horrible luck with moisturizers
after running out of my old moisturizer i found this product
the cream is light
their ibuki refining moisturizer feels thin
i am very surprised by this moisturizer.
i apply jojoba oil at night as my moisturizer
it goes away the second you put moisturizer on
so what i did was i added a moisturizer right away
i just apply my moisturizer after
this works well with retinol oils applied 15 minutes after then followed by moisturizer
i did have to have my moisturizer open
once i put on moisturizer
when followed by a moisturizer is fine
put sun-screen moisturizer on after
goes aways when you put moisturizer on
i put moisturizer on right away afterwards
i prefer to get my antioxidants from my lotions
i always wear sunscreen
use it under day and night moisturizers.
creamy cleansers leave me feeling like there's a film of oil on my face
it even took off my toofaced better than sex waterproof mascara
it removes all my waterproof mascara
i feel super confident wearing zero concealer or make-up now
i found that it didn't do that good a job at taking my waterproof mascara off
especially my waterproof mascara
my skin absorbs any essence/serum/moisturizer that i put on afterwards better than ever before
it leaves my skin feeling moisturizer
you don't need any additional moisturizer
i need to get some lotion on asap feeling
apply my night serums
the little exfoliating beads the whole experience was great
even the most stubborn mascara
even my gel mascara
i originally found this product while browsing skincare at nordstrom
some type of oat lotion
i’m not desperately reaching for my moisturizer or a sheet mask to put back the hydration
almost like after your moisturizer sinks in?
often after using this i'll forget to put moisturizer on
this balm is perfect for a simple
it washes off my mascara too
knew i needed to start looking into skincare with retinol
also the eye cream
prefer using a powder bronzer instead
prefer to use the serum with a different moisturizer--my skin can't h
this is one of the best night creams i have ever used
i usually don't use a retinol cream every night
i also like the day cream.
this is the best facial cream i have tried
skincare is one thing i splurge on
switched back to my regular clinique daily moisturizer
i don't even use eye cream
one caveat is that this is not a moisturizer
i would use this along with an eye moisturizer
do not even try botox use this super eye serum
make sure you use a very emollient cream over this product- it is not intended to be a moisturizer
i would not say this is a super emollient cream just fyi
no amount of concealer hides it without looking cakey
will put a retinol eye cream as layer 1
i highly recommend an spf eye cream to everyone
this eye cream is so good!
i really wanted an eye cream with spf
i apply over eye cream, before concealer.
this is the best eye cream for the money!
i love my eye cream
this is a great lightweight eye cream that is perfect for the daytime because of the spf
when i started using a retinol eye product at night i needed also to find a good eye product for day with spf protection
it's hard to find an eye moisturizer with adequate coverage
i need to wear sunscreen daily or i will burn.
i really like this eye cream because it has spf
this daytime eye cream is fabulous.
and who doesn't need sunscreen?
doesn't cause my concealer to cake into my wrinkles
the best eye cream with spf i have ever used
keep in mind this is a sunscreen for the eyes
i still have redness on my face after i put my moisturizer on
i always apply sunscreen liberally
i find this product effective when being used with sunscreen
soft i often forget my moisturizer
at night i use a concentrated moisturizer
this product can actually replace your tinted moisturizer
i just used less moisturizer
concealer goes on sparingly
think of it like tinted lotion or self tanner that you can wash off after a day
adding a moisturizer is too much
i can see people getting acne if they use moisturizer on top of it
except for maybe some under-eye concealer
the resurgence day cream is on of the best moisturizers with spf i have ever used
this night cream is so rich
i love this night cream.
most moisturizers make me break out
daily sheer luster moisturizer
this cream is very heavy.
this can be a "miracle" cream
i usually don't use moisturizer at night
this lotion is part of that improvement
almost like the lotion brings them out
for the past several years i have not used any moisturizer other than california baby everyday lotion because my skin tends to react
this is one of the best creams out there.
i feel i can wait on the botox!
this creme works for me as an undercreme for my makeup
it seems to break out with most other moisturisers
you almost don't need a moisturizer afterward
it does not do as well on waterproof mascara
nothing that my drugstore moisturizer doesn't help right away
i love this cleanser for five main reasons:- it improves skin texture- helps keep your skin moisturized- makes you feel like you just had a facial- has no parabens
i don't really want to use exfoliating products on my eye anyway
though i don't use waterproof mascara
moisturizers has been a miracle for my face
just a little bronzer for color as i'm very fair
s on the murad day lotion i was sold
moisturizers that make my skin look like i am 30 again
even with great moisturizers
the missing star is because i need to wash my face twice sometimes after using an spf moisturizer
i did purchase the toner and night cream with it.
mascara with a little massaging
this is the only change i made in my skincare regimen
then apply a light sunscreen
moisturizers that i buy from sephora
this is totally perfect to use for a moisturizer before putting on makeup
during winter i have to apply a thicker moisturizer on top
applied a thin layer of this as my night time moisturizer
a lot of cream moisturizers are too heavy
i just slather this stuff on
i definitely still have to use moisturizer though
haven't tried it as an overnight moisturizer yet.
my previous moisturizer was too thick
i usually use lotion type moisturizers
i just slather this on
i think it would be very nice to use after an exfoliator
exfoliate pretty regularly to keep my acne in check
the cucumber gel mask is my absolute favorite
the only thing i wish is that it was a little more moisturizing
even after i apply a moisturizer
it isn't great at getting mascara off
i know it is weird to rub it in your face like lotion
a base plus the mascara itself
this lotion on dry skin method works great
nothing outrageous just like any shampoo
i still need moisturizer
mostly just a tinted moisturizer
slightly moisturizer in that my skin isn't craving for some lotion afterwards
find that i need less moisturizer after using this
i like to mix it in with my moisturizer for better absorption
plus i need to put my regular moisturizer on top.
really performs best when mixed with a moisturizer
as well as moisturizer
bought it to mix with my moisturizer
mixing with either my moisturizer or with my bb cream
you definitely need an actual moisturizing lotion after this
it is a lightweight "dry" oil that can be worn over moisturizer or alone
being in my late 30's my skin requires a moisturizer
i love to mix a drop or 2 of this oil to my existing favorite moisturizer
cream moisturizers were not doing it
i mix this with my moisturizer
i put a tiny bit in my moisturizer in the am
trying out different night moisturizers for my breakout prone skin
don't forget the sunscreen
i also use it as a nighttime moisturizer.
probably my favourite moisturizer ever.
this moisturizer has truly saved my life
i recommend using this moisturizer if you frequently use acne treatments
this is the best facial cream ever!
cream are go-to products for me
this is my go-to moisturizer.
night creams for years trying to achieve the results i got from this cream
its my forever moisturizer.
except when i wear this lotion
will be a staple in my skincare regimen forever
i would much prefer if it came in a jar like the ceramidin gel cream or the ceramidin oil balm
it's decent under concealer for example around the nose
some moisturizers break me out.
this moisturizer is amazing for combination skin.
this honestly has to be my holy grail moisturizer
its a fantastic moisturizer that doesn't irritate or break out my skin
the employee recommended this cream to me
this is one of the best creams i have used.
moisturizer in the am
as its a nice thick moisturizer
so i started using this cream.
this moisturizer really helped
i hate creams that feel greasy
never spent this much on a moisturizer before
this is my go to moisturizer for any time if the day
i cannot feel that much moisturize my face
slathering this cream on my face
it did moisturize well although i needed more anti aging then this cream offers
it really feels like my skin drinks in this moisturizer
this moisturizer has saved my life.
this moisturizer is the best thing i've ever tried
the best moisturizer i have found for my dry
this is by far the best face moisturizer i have used
i would love to share this with everyone that ceramidin is the best moisturizer
i love this cream.
it is the best moisturizer i have used
it gets into the lotion
i've tried countless skincare moisturizers to help me with dryness
all the moisturizers i have tried never gave me enough hydration or don't work well with the topical creams
this moisturizer really helps to balance everything out
i loved the effects of this moisturizer
followed by a different moisturizer
this is my holy grail moisturizer!
best moisturizer, been using for 2 years now.
i just ordered my second tube to use as an everyday moisturizer
think it works best when using the lotion first
this moisturizer has been a life changer for me.
this moisturizer has made my face look so much better
s down the best moisturizer i've ever used
it does everything a moisturizer should.
although i liked the $200 creams
i could not find a lotion that could moisturize my skin well enough to prevent dry patches
this is the moisturizer for you
this moisturizer is the only one i've found that is moisturizing enough without making me greasy
it is enough moisturizer for me in cold ny winters
this is my favorite moisturizer.
this cream is amazing
moisturizers my dry skin--a little goes a long way
i must explain how hard it is for me to find a good moisturizer that actually moisturize my inner dry sensitive oily skin
most of any moisturizers make me break out
i like to mix this with my other gel type moisturizer for added boost of moisture for my face
works great at night as a moisturizer over medicated rosacea cream
so my moisturizer is there to seal in all the benefits of the serums/oils
i like it mixed with a lighter moisturizer for nighttime
i think i may have found my go to moisturizer
this moisturizer feels so rich
origins ginzing moisturizer had this effect unfortunately
my skin loved this cream!
this cream is perfect for it
i'll just stick to a good moisturizer for now.
this moisturizer had almost completely changed that
this is one of the best moisturizers you can buy
for morning i use the lighter dr jart water drops moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
the consistency is a little thicker than other moisturizers i've tried
which is my winter moisturizer
i really like this cream
safe face lotion during pregnancy is hard
i love this cream.
finally, my hg moisturizer!!
best moisturizer i have ever used for my dry flakey skin
i tried a few "skin sensitive" moisturizers
this is the only moisturizer that keeps the flakiness to a minimum
my usual moisturizer wasn't keeping up
i adore this lotion.
i also use the cream
adds a little kick to the moisturizer!!
the most lighweight cream ever!
cream are go-to products for me
just adds an extra boost of hydration to any moisturizer you put on after
this is definitely my new favourite moisturizer
it buys me some time to moisturize my body before i apply my moisturizer
more of a serum than a cream or lotion
i used it over the summer when all i needed was a lightweight moisturizer
in the morning under my daytime moisturizer
i used it under my regular moisturizer
the liquid and cream are the perfect combo !
the cream however can
it was used a long with the water drops moisturizer
i'll keep using this a long with the water drops moisturizer
this is a no-nonsense lotion
tend to purchase those types of moisturizers
i love this moisturizer!
this is a great light lotion for the summer.
i also use it with the ceramidin cream.
then i tried using it in conjunction with my regular moisturizer
using it with my normal moisturizer makes my skin look dewy
've been on the look out for a new moisturizer
really great before moisturizer.
love it so much i just bought the gel cream too.
that said, it's a fantastic moisturizer!
this cream is amazing!
used more moisturizer the next day
used it under my normal moisturizer.
may splurge and try the cream as well.
cream has been my skin's saviour
it definitely is a great complement to any moisturizing lotion or cream you may have that already works well for you
before my sunscreen/moisturizer
i also love layering this with other serums with other benefits
then followed by moisturizer
the moisturizer absorbs way better
layer this under a thicker moisturizer if your skin is dry
serums to help with my crazy dry skin in the winter
this is a great moisturizer that sinks in
i think this lotion helps calm my skin
if you watch my skincare routine
i think i could use it as my only moisturizer once summer hits
not have that gross feeling of regular lotion
works best with the moisturizer of the same line.
im so used to applying moisturizers when my face is still a bit wet
it's incredible even without the moisturizer on top
jart oil balm or the jart cream or beauty balm especially when the winter is really harsh
for me it seems to offer more hydration when applied under my day lotion
then follow with my regular moisturizer
this moisturizer beats them all.
i absolutely love this ceramidin liquid lotion!
the lotion with matching cream layered on top at night
i follow up with weleda almond lotion as a moisturizer
you'll need to follow up with a moisturizer
this moisturizer brings life
i add this serum under my moisturizer on cold days
'll stick to using it under moisturizer/makeup
incredible moisturizer for combination skin.
mixed with an spf50 facial sunblock
this is probably the best skincare item i have ever used
i don't even need to wear foundation or tinted moisturizer anymore
decided to up my skincare game to the max
this moisturizer is truly amazing.
i also use the eye cream
i never thought i needed a moisturizer
this cream is amazing.
this moisturizer has a great list of beneficial ingredients
heavier than her other daily moisturizers.
totally inlove with this cream!
once i began to use this product a long with the moisturizer
went to sephora for some skincare regimen shopping because that's the only thing that could help me
i always follow washing my face with moisturizer anyway
i'll only notice if i don't use any moisturizer afterwards
i finish with the ibuki refining moisturizer.
the moisturizer are amazing
while not necessarily moisturizing in its own right
it also worked great with the moisturizer from the same line
almost feels like a lotion
keep in mind that you will need a moisturizer to use following the cleanser
amazing moisturizer for dry skin!
after researching good face moisturizers for dry skin
moisturizer for about 2 weeks now
the moisturizer is my favorite part
this though- i feel like this is a much better night moisturizer than the mask
this moisturizer is perfect for the winter months when my skin can get really dry
i love this moisturizer.
not only has this moisturizer given my skin a more consistent texture
i love this moisturizer for keeping my skin from getting texture during the dry winters
this moisturizer does make my skin look
use their spf moisturizer in the morning
this is now my fave moisturizer for the colder months
i also use the ibuki protective moisturizer with spf
even loves this moisturizer
i am very picky with my moisturizers
i swear this moisturizer works miracles
love love love this moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i've used h
this is my favorite moisturizer for dry winters.
many moisturizers only stay on the surface
i really like this moisturizer!!
there is nothing i love more than this moisturizer
what moisturizer i use
this is a great moisturizer for 20-somethings
the sephora employee used the skiniq to match me up with a moisturizer for my combination skin
wow this moisturizer really makes a difference
this moisturizer does it's job
this is the perfect moisturizer.
this moisturizer is truly amazing.
this moisturizer has not given me any problems
it is more of a cream texture rather than a gel
i found my switch to this moisturizer
i've used the ibuki moisturizer for about 3 months without a problem
this moisturizer is fantastic at targeting the dry spots
the previous formulation of protective moisturizer spf 15 was perfect
the moisturizer has now been replaced with the ibuki line
then i won't need two moisturizers
i've used this moisturizer for about 3 months now
i originally went with the refining moisturizer in the pump
then i apply this cream
before using this cream
i usually use shiseido pureness moisturizer
i love this moisturizer in my nightime skincare routine
it is a very thick moisturizer
before i could order more i had to use a backup moisturizer
i absolutely adore this moisturizer
tend to tear with other moisturizers
i am on my 6th jar of this moisturizer
this is a wonderful moisturizer
i decided to go back to this moisturizer
this will remain my hg night time moisturizer
switched to this moisturizer after reading what it was suppose to do
this has become my staple moisturizer
it doesn't contain spf so you do need to add sunscreen for daytime use
i also use this moisturizer alone
that is the beauty of this product you only need a couple dabs
love everything about this moisturizer.
this cream moisturizer is thicker than i am used to
i would definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone with combination skin like mine
'enriched' moisturizers as they tend to keep my skin
it's such a great moisturizer for those with young adult skin
this moisturizer does this
its a great winter time moisturizer.
i switched to this moisturizer
this is truly a unique moisturizer.
perfect pm moisturizer for me
i absolutely love this moisturizer!
i tried a number of other moisturizers
you need this moisturizer
refining moisturizer in the daytime
i love this moisturizer.
i would highly recommend this moisturizer to those with combo/dry skin
i also tried the matching day moisturizer with spf
this is my absolute favorite moisturizer ever.
i finally came around to the idea of using a moisturizer
first time i have switched my moisturizer in ages
the most fabulous moisturizer i have ever used
this moisturizer is a little heavier than the other with the pump
this cream is very moisturing
this cream is so rich
works great as a nighttime moisturizer.
this is by far the best moisturizer i've ever tried
this moisturizer is divine
it's a must have moisturizer.
i read reviews about this moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
what i like about this moisturizer is that it absorbs really quickly
this moisturizer saved my skin
i've tried it with concealer
i decided to go back to using clarins brightening lotion during the day
then using this ibuki moisturizer only at night
this moisturizer is the best i have ever used in my life
i absolutely love this moisturizer
this moisturizer works amazingly for me during winter time
this is the best face moisturizer i've ever used
i am a bit of a skincare junkie
have been searching for a nice moisturizer to use on my combination/sensitive skin
i may change to the lotion in the summer
for winter the cream is great
this moisturizer is very thick
i mainly purchased this with the intention of needing a good moisturizer
this moisturizer feels great
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
it's such a great night/day moisturizer.
i will definitely add this to my skin care regimen
i am very particular about moisturizer
s down the best moisturizer i've ever used in the winter
this moisturizer doesn't do all that it says it will
i love this cream.
i really like this cream
i just started using this moisturizer over my origins serum
this is my best ever day moisturizer.
i'll never switch to another moisturizer after this
i needed a moisturizer than could heavily moisturize my face without breaking me out
this moisturizer changed my life.
even tho i have oily skin i love this as a night time moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
i felt like i needed a night time moisturizer
this has become my new go to moisturizer!!!!
moisturizer for about 2 weeks now
i love this cream!
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
sometimes i feel like i have tried every moisturizer on the plant…
works like light botox
i love this moisturizer
use it everyday as my daytime cream
other good creams i decided to try something new
best moisturizer and great effect.
i rarely have to use extra moisturizer
i started to think that maybe i will spend more on skincare
this is the best creme
it is only creme that will help
back to the search for a new moisturizer.
this is much more of a balm than a traditional eye cream
i just love this eye cream.
this works well to keep my undereye area pretty moisturizer
i love this eye cream.
a lot of eye creams break me out
i've tried a lot of eye creams in my day
i truly like this eye cream.
love this eye cream.
it even provides an excellent base for under eye concealer
my favorite eye cream!
t's perfect to use during the day under concealer
this eye cream is amazing.
best eye cream ever!!!
best eye cream ever!
this eye cream does it all.
love this eye cream!
love this eye cream!
i've noticed my concealer glides on after applying the eye cream
making for fewer issues with application of your under eye concealer
it does not settle in the fine lines like a heavier concealer might
i didn't like oily eye cream
this eye cream does it all
not telling anyone i changed my skincare routine
helps my concealer glide on
best eye cream for younger people
best face cream ever
this lotion left my skin moisturized all day
i really like this face cream.
i really like this cream.
i can wear it under sunscreen and again at night.
this moisturizer goes on like silk
same results i got with much more expensive moisturizers
i switched to this from clinique's moisturizer
not sticky like many other light moisturizers
it is a wonderful moisturizer.
that's okay because it doubles as a night cream without smelling like sunscreen
this is by far the best moisturizer i've found.
then mix this product with my daily facial moisturizer
right before my moisturizer
am officially sold on using a face oil as a moisturizer for my combination skin
i started applying this under my moisturizer
i've also found that i need less moisturizer when i apply this first
this leaves your skin feeling moisturizer
once i started using the oil in addition to my moisturizer it started getting better
i will never use a traditional moisturizer again
for really dry skin i would recommend mixing it with an additional moisturizer
i always bought the gel primer
bonus that it layers beautifully under sunscreen/primer/moisturizer- no irritation
this eye cream is everything!
most eye creams i've tried just seem to moisturize my eye area
love this eye cream!
hope the skin cream does as much as the eye cream has
i wanted something a little more moisturizing for the winter
i definitely still had to use moisturizer after
i follow it with the boscia exfoliating gel a couple times a week
its not as tough on mascara
it even gets off my mascara
i can't say how it is with waterproof mascara because i don't wear waterproof
it's gentle for getting eye makeup/mascara off
not exactly great for my super water proof mascara
i went to cold cream
once i do the rest of my skincare routine my skin feels fine again
wake up feeling so moisturizer
it's not a build-able moisturizer
follow with lighter moisturizer
can get flaky if i don't moisturize
it's more like a deep moisturizer than a mask.
so it works great as an overnight moisturizer.
am always trying to find a good night time moisturizer
it is clever advertising to call it a sleeping mask when it is just a really great moisturizer
this isn't so much of a mask as it is a super moisturizer for bedtime
i slather this on
a sephora employee recommended it to me for a nightly moisturizer
lovely cream is light enough to use under my bb cream
i actually use this as a daily moisturizer
even a deep moisturizer at night
i love this night time moisturizer.
then this miracle of a lotion
all kidding aside this sleeping mask is ultra-moisturizing
i love this cream!
anti aging creams are my go to!
absorbs quickly which is what i like in a moisturizer
i freaking love this moisturizer.
especially depending on what creams i use.
like i hate the smell of their resilience lift moisturizer
not many moisturizers have this
this is an absolutely great moisturizer!
i love this cream!
even though this moisturizer is not targeted for my age
this moisturizer has changed my skincare game.
this moisturizer is actually a step above
i wear this as my main moisturizer at night
even if i don't put moisturizer on in the morning
i will never go back to another moisturizer again
however i am very interested in great moisturizer because that is the best way to fight aging is having a proper moisturizer
i obviously love this moisturizer
this is an absolutely great moisturizer!
i needed something that can moisturize well pre-concealer
blended with the concealer if i am extra dry
i love this cream !
they took daily use for a jar or 2 of moisturizer
now i only use my mega-bright moisturizer as a night cream occasionally
i will not be discontinuing the use of my undereye concealer anytime soon
the skincare associate recommended this eye cream since i have sensitive skin
it takes less concealer to cover up my circles
i love this eye cream!
i wear a lot of moisturizer everyday
usually have to use heavy concealer below my eyes
i really love the idea of just wearing moisturizer
enough to get me hooked on this moisturizer
talking to my younger self about sunscreen
i don't have trowel on the concealer the way i used to
i've used this cream in the daytime
i still have to use a concealer
it made me comfortable enough to skip the under eye concealer
it is still a little bumpy looking if i use the wrong concealer/primer
have used just about every concealer possible to try to cover them up
even concealer doesn't help.
i really like this moisturizer-it's light weight
which means i always have to wear layers of heavy concealer
my concealer definitely stays put
absolutely love this eye cream.
for the price this eye cream is refreshing
my concealer looking good
omg does my concealer look amazing
i will say though i do need concealer still for the puffiness i get sometimes under my eyes
in truth i prefer the wrinkle smoothing properties of this cream
my concealer used to just sit on my skin
i don't need to wear concealer as often.
the sales associate gave me a saple of the moisturizer
this cream is amazing.
this moisturizer has really helped my skins texture
retinol are perfect combo-use in morning under makeup
of all the moisturizers i've used
i've never finished a whole size moisturizer in my life
this moisturizer is amazing.
i love this moisturizer!
i really like this moisturizer
i find my face looks less shiny with this product than with most moisturizers i've tried which is a plus
which is an issue i had with the ddg hyaluronic moisturizer
not the best combo for finding a great moisturizer
this face cream is perfect.
especially his anti-aging moisturizer
highly recommend this moisturizer.
i really like this moisturizer
even serves as a good base for my day lotion
spf 20 moisturizer in the am
this moisturizer is very nice.
this moisturizer feels like velvet.
i absolutely love this moisturizer
love, love, love this moisturizer!
i love this cream.
sunscreen went over it nicely
this is a great night time moisturizer for me.
i love this anti-aging moisturizer after having used it for several weeks
this moisturizer is stellar
was wow'ed by this moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer (day or night).
i am extremely happy with this moisturizer.
i find this moisturizer to be perfect for my skin
i always used clinique moisturizer
to make this moisturizer even better
this moisturizer has left my skin smooth
my undereyes seem a little dry one i apply concealer
now after using their eye balm + the naked concealer
i like the smell of this moisturizer
since i have combo skin leaning towards oily i always apply creams at night
this cream lifted my skin
with this moisturizer it looked way better
i've used so many moisturizers
it worked well as a moisturizer under makeup
while there have been other moisturizers i've enjoyed
this cream is amazing
seriously the softest most moisturizing cream i have ever used
this moisturizer does not live my skin wanting more hydration
i've used almost every anti-aging moisturizer around the $100 mark
the cream is very think with a gel like quality.
the best moisturizer i have used.
including the moisturizer for over 2 years
can't recommend this cream enough!
i decided to try the cream
i love this cream.
wonderful under tinted moisturizer
bought my second jar of this cream
i love this moisturizer.
s down the best moisturizer i've ever used
as i can't go spending this much on a moisturizer every other month
in the morning i follow with my sunscreen
the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because i use the algenist tinted moisturizer
this moisturizer is always soothing
once i apply it works as a great moisturizer
this is currently my favorite moisturizer overall
i see the effects this moisturizer can give for my stressed out skin
this is a rich moisturizer that i use at night with the algenist genius serum
this moisturizer doesn't make that worse
i highly recommend this moisturizer.
it works like any other cream
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
this is the moisturizer for you
my favorite moisturizer ever
this moisturizer is one of the best i have used
i can't believe i finally found a wrinkle cream that actually works
it is not a heavy cream
there are a lot of good moisturizers on the market
this moisturizer is the only one i can use right now because it doesn't give me chin acne
my holy grail moisturizer!
need a moisturizer with strong uv protection
this was still nice for a fancy moisturizer
i now use what i have left of this as an extra layer of moisturizer over everything on nights i feel i need more hydration
this cream is amazing
this face cream is amazing.
luckily my moisturizer is awesome
so just have a great moisturizer
mattifying for me in the summer
then i always use s lot of moisturizer both morning
it's a twice-weekly pampering that i enjoy
it also felt very moisturized to the point that i didn't even have to slather on moisturizer after
it left my skin so soft--it didn't advertise as exfoliating
waiting for next paycheck to buy the mattifying gel
i just put some moisturizer on
ready for moisturizer afterwards
i then follow with the blemish pads then finish with my intense hydrating cream
bought this since the original moisturizer was amazing
i made sure to apply a moisturizer to my skin to avoid over drying
foundation as well as bronzer
it goes away once i put on my moisturizer
moisturizer it goes away
i put it on before my morning moisturizer.
this mask is a thick moisturizer consistency
i think the best part of this mask is the undeniable moisturizing effect
right now he is using kate sommerville's acne spot lotion
moisturizer to go along with this to achieve beautiful skin
didn't think it was necessary to apply a moisturizer
this cream is great
so i use it in the morning before sunscreen.
i also use shiseido spf 50 face sunscreen every day
this cream moistrise my skin
this is one i keep in my arsenal when i not only need an intense moisturizer
needing a heavy nighttime moisturizer i saw this product
i like to put it on at night instead of moisturizer
i put it on like moisturizer at night
compared to the boscia overnight moisturizer
i went out that morning with no concealer or foundation
is so hydrating that i don't need to use am additional moisturizer when i put this on
this eye cream is just amazing
that you also can use for e about 10 minutes as a moisturizing mask
this lotion is excellent!
i apply the same amount that i would with any other moisturizer
this is the best eye cream ever !
this eye cream is definitely for you
love this eye cream!
this eye cream does wonders
i really like this eye cream.
i love this eye cream as a preventative eye cream
i definitely noticed concealer doesn't get as cakey
this is one of the best eye creams this product jumkie has ever used
probably one of the best under eye creams i have used
it was moisturizing with the ability to apply concealer over without any peeling
my concealer applies nicely on top
pricey but the best eye cream i'm used.
this is the best eye cream i've ever used.
i really like this eye cream.
it keeps my eye area moisturizer
i've purchased eye creams from guerlain
i love this cream.
the black tea moisturizer would irritate them
this eye cream is amazing to me.
i would love to find a whole face moisturizer that feels like this
this is the perfect daytime eye cream!
i started using fresh lotus moisturizer which is way better priced
this eye cream is super refreshing
love this eye cream.
it's worked as a great moisturizer
this is a great eye cream
it works great under my concealer to help it last
works well with concealer
apply this serum before moisturizer
all i need after this product is a tinted moisturizer
night before my moisturizer
i find my lightweight spf moisturizers feel like enough during the day when i use this the night before
this is the best moisturizer i ever used for my face
in the winter, i use it with josie maran cream.
i've always used a basic moisturizer
it makes it hard to wear concealer without it drying out
i can't use this as a daily moisturizer
what a waste of an expensive moisturizer!
i love this cream (i use it as a cream).
i can mix this into my moisturizer or even my foundation
the best natural face moisturizer i have tried.
so moisturizer is absolutely necessary
richer moisturizers usually break me out
the argan light under my moisturizer at night
i tend to alternate this one with a lighter moisturizer
have tried just about everything in search of the best facial moisturizer/serum
it takes a lot to impress me with a skincare product
my favorite moisturizer had been discontinued
i usually put some on my concealer around my dry patched
i guess you need a different more lightweight moisturizer in the summer
very very oily.... almost like sunscreen.
i put this one before my moisturizer as well
i've also used this as a light moisturizer all over the face
i sometimes use this in place of my normal moisturizer
i just use it like a moisturizer and go.
she said it the most amazing moisturizer
i love this moisturizer for bedtime!
it's more like a moisturizer than a mask
truly moisturizers your face
this treatment is like a miracle cream!
after using the youth exfoliate mask i really needed a moisturizer
applied my usual moisturizer after
no moisturizer would help
i love slathering this stuff on after exfoliating in the shower at the beginning of the day
as my normal routine wasn't doing anything to help moisturize my skin
this is now one of my favorite moisturizer.
i do prefer massaging it in afterwards so that i can forego a moisturizer
i wear this as a moisturizer at night
was had a dry patch on my face from a bad moisturizer
it is a heavy moisturizer
perfect moisturizer for me!
this was the only moisturizer that was able to help
this is a great overnight cream
i started using this product as a nighttime moisturizer
just rub it in like a regular moisturizer
it's an amazing moisturizer.
or its just a really good antiaging/ line
so you can use it for longer time than average moisturizer
i am not a skincare trend person
this is that lotion.
i love this cream.
i finally found a moisturizer that is fabulous
this is one of the best moisturizers i have ever used
this cream is so moisturing
you will never try another moisturizer again
my favorite all time cream.
especially when it comes to moisturizers
even another moisturizer i love
i love this cream
i would find this to be too heavy to be a morning moisturizer
after trying this product for a week i knew i needed to add this to my skin normal skincare regimen
i feel using the vinepert firming cream
although i am using two moisturizers at night
this is the best moisturizer i have used.
having many skin issues along with sensitivity this is a phenomenal moisturizer for day
my holy grail moisturizer!
i will just have to budget this creme in.
i tried the cream rich
i wear concealer over it
if you don't worry about your undereye concealer creasing or don't wear concealer in the first place
concealer to combat the white cast
i've used many creams that cause my eyeliner/mascara to travel down my face
i wear it everyday with concealer on top
it doesn't bother my concealer
this eye cream is amazing.
didn't even come back with a tan after using all my shisedo sunscreens
sunscreen is a must for me.
this is my first eye sunscreen
i love this cream.
makes sense to use sunscreen around the eyes
then supplement with this eye cream
because even though i try to wear sunscreen daily
advanced anti-aging eye cream broad spectrum sunscreen spf 37
i needed to walk out with a moisturizing eye cream with spf
it doesn't smell anything like sunscreen
fairly thick under eye moisturizer
why don't more under-eye creams have spf?
so sunscreen is m
a good face sunscreen under my makeup
i would definitely keep this as a part of my skincare regiment
i love my tinted moisturizer
it works really well with the ren calm moisturizer for blemish prone skin
i never have to scrub my eyes to get all of my mascara
mascara comes right off
stubborn lipsticks or liquid lipstick
i just prefer the balm
i prefer this to the ttdo balm
i don't use waterproof mascara
buxom waterproof mascara daily
then id have to use a cream to remove my mascara
just tinted moisturizer most of the time
especially the waterproof mascara with the primer underneath
erases all my tough waterproof mascara
especially if you're the type to wear waterproof mascara
i wear a lot of eyeliner
followed with my regular moisturizer.
it is absolutely amazing it removes everything including my ysl babydoll mascara
my water proof mascara
a brilliant product for undereye use before concealer
cover them with concealer every day
although the concealer still creases
i mainly use this under my eyes before applying my concealer
you need to use very little for good moisturization
moisturizer perfectly all day long
a really good moisturizer for my skin however it has a really strong scent to it
i've tried so many lifting firming creams only to be disappointed
its not a miracle cream
use concealer on top
the concealer doesn't go into my wrinkles because of it
for me in makes a huge difference with concealer/foundation/powder from settling into the wrinkles
i wear it alone with a little bronzer
i mix a very small tad of tinted moisturizer in with my regular moisturizer
i like using this product when i skip foundation or tinted moisturizer
this is an excellent lightweight moisturizer.
kate somerville as my favorite moisturizer
i am so pleased with this moisturizer.
i really like this moisturizer.
i liked this moisturizer because it didn't make my skin oily
heavy moisturizers just sit on my skin.
i truly love this lotion.
really great light moisturizer.
let it soak in before applying the fresh peony spf lotion
i love this moisturizer.
if you are heavy on the moisturizer
this moisturizer has yet to do that
this lotion is perfect for that.
i will not call this lotion a miracle worker.
i think it's less the lotion
after shopping around for a perfect moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
it is a little heavier than my morning moisturizer
my favorite lotion for giving a fresh dewy look on bare skin
i know it's because of the lotion
i sometimes wear it under moisturizer
i like how this lotion feels when it's applied to my face
if this had a little bit of sunblock in it
i love this lotion.
once my lotion runs out i think i might purchase this one
have a hard time finding a lotion that is lightweight
daily moisturizer to help brighten my skin
i love the youth preserve moisturizer
i don't even need to use serum before the lotion.
this was a lovely lightweight moisturizer perfect for summer when your skin craves just enough protection
i love this face lotion!
used this lotion for a week.
i tried this lotion
if you want a day lotion
are willing to add a separate spf lotion to your routine
this is a really nice, light moisturizer.
this lotion is very useful in summer for dry skin
while my skin is too oily to use this as a daily moisturizer
this lotion is lovely.
moisturizers go on easier and i use less.
i follow up with a light moisturizer
i follow with ptr moisturizer or first aid beauty cream
the better your skin will look when combined with 1 of perricone moisturizers afterward
i definitely recommend this product as a supplement to your skincare regimen
i don't really use skincare save for moisturizer
this is going to be a staple in my skincare routine
it feels good to pamper myself twice a week with a facial
moisturizer on daily basis
be sure you moisturize after you use this use tho
thinking about getting the face finishing moisturizer next
sometimes moisturizers will make my cheeks
this moisturizer makes my skin look glowy
i got it because i wanted a moisturizer with spf
absolutely love this moisturizer.
one of my all time favourite moisturizers with spf
this is the best daily moisturizer i've ever used
my go to daily moisturizer!
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
doesn't flake like some spf moisturizers have in the past
this moisturizer is great
this moisturizer/ sunscreen is great!
hands-down my favourite moisturizer!
this is a really great moisturizer.
then switched to a perfect world age-defense moisturizer
this moisturizer is just lovely
as i found my previous moisturizers had the tendency to do
i love that this moisturizer is long wearing
love this everyday moisturizer.
most moisturizers break me out
this moisturizer is a bit heavy
a perfect world are my two go-to moisturizers
his creams are amazing
while the moisturizer is a pretty good one
i now mix clarins spf with origins ginzing moisturizer for under my makeup
it feels less heavy than a concealer
i love this moisturizer.
with this moisturizer i noticed a plum glow to my skin
i pair the cream with clarins eye cream
highly impressed with this moisturizer.
this is the only moisturizer that works
this is the only moisturizer i don't mind using for an spf
it's a light weight moisturizer
i stay matte for most of the day
i am hooked on this moisturizer!
i wanted to try this moisturizer because of the spf
sometimes heavier moisturizers at night
this cream is great
my first sunscreen face moisturizer
the clinique sun block moisturizer during the day
he isn't a huge fan of lotion
i also mix it with any night time oil or moisturizer i use
will add some to my moisturizer
at night with my moisturizers
with your moisturizer or makeup
i do add it to my serums in the am
this stuff is the perfect daytime moisturizer eye products
since i usually use a concealer i started by using this only on no makeup days
concealer cake on it
not look like concealer
if i'm going out for the day i will sometimes put concealer on top
this cream does all that!
i will throw a darker concealer over it
i do not like to wear foundation/concealer on a daily basis
pilled when i tried it on top of my moisturizer
i don't use under eye concealer
cake like a concealer does
i need next to no concealer after applying it.
is much littler than concealer
put concealer over it
i can tell a difference in my concealer when i skip this step
finally put your favourite under eye concealer
i love this eye cream soso much!
then i will put some concealer
so now i use a beauty blender or my tarte concealer brush to apply it
use this under your concealer
i rarely have to wear concealer under my eyes anymore after applying this product in the morning
great mixed with an eye primer or concealer, too!
love this eye cream.
i can wear this without concealer
can apply a little concealer over without making me look older
this is technically not a concealer
provides a light level of concealer for under eye dark spots
which means less concealer :d
this helped cover up my under eye circles since i couldn't do concealer
it provides such a great base for my concealer
while it isn't concealer
i would recommend a concealer over it still if you have very dark under eye circles like myself
this is seriously one of the best eye creams i've ever purchased
i still use some concealer on top for coverage
i never wear concealer anymore
creates a great base for concealer
it's better than any concealer i've used
i rarely wear concealer since i started using this
the product is so good i sometimes don't even put concealer over it
combined with my concealer it looks natural
it makes my concealer perform better.
it brightens my eyes so much that i don't always need concealer
no foundation/tinted moisturizer
i usually always wear concealer
nothing heavy so your under-eye concealer
you may not even need your concealer when using this
i even use it as my bed time eye cream since it's pretty moisturizing
this cream is the best product i have ever used for puffiness h
it works a little better with concealer
by morning i still have to use a good under eye concealer
apply to under eyes first to prep for heavier concealer
helps prevent creasing of concealer if applied on top
or in place of concealer while i'm roughing it at the cabin
used under nars creamy concealer
eye cream and concealer in one.
some days i don't even use a concealer i just dot some product under my eyes
use it every night along with my fab ultra repair cream to moisturize
the employee recommended this instead of concealer because it would brighten the area without adding product that would crease
allowing me to go without concealer
t works great under my concealer
doesn't cause mascara smudging like most eye creams
a little bit more in the morning as under eye concealer
goes well under concealer
no matter what moisturizer i follow with
i found it more exfoliating than i expected
this mask left my face feeling as though i had already applied a moisturizer
i almost always have to use a moisturizer after using a mask
always follow with a good moisturizer
or mixed into chosen moisturizer
i mix 2 drops in with my moisturizer.
it stretches the longevity of my moisturizer
before my eye cream
so dry i couldn't put enough moisturizer on my skin
i do follow with belief aqua bomb moisturizer
at night before my retinol cream
this is not a moisturizer
then use your moisturizer
this isn't like a moisturizer
this makes my skin feel great i use it under my moisturizer
this is one of the best serums i've ever tried.
my skin started feeling slightly dry again even after i applied my moisturizer
i mix a few drops in with my moisturizer every morning
i applied this as a serum under my usual moisturizer
i've enjoyed the josie maran argan milk to add to my moisturizer during the winter
this is the perfect moisturizer for me
frequently my moisturizers will sit oily on top of my skin
this moisturizer is just right for daytime.
need a heavier duty moisturizer at night
i follow up with a serum and moisturizer.
it takes off my bb cream/ sunscreen too
i typically only wear a tinted moisturizer
i love the pampering this adds to my routine
i simply put a thin layer of this product over the pm lotion in the acne kit
i do not apply a separate moisturizer first
this eye cream is so light
i used the belif eye cream before this one
every other night as a sealant to my night moisturizer
use ole henriksen sheer transformation moisturizer
you'll definitely want to use a moisturizer with it
i just make sure to follow it up with a good moisturizer
always put moisturizer on immediately afterwards
i seriously do not need to use a separate moisturizer
use my usual vitamin e oil/balm sticks to moisturize my face when i go to bed
my face feels like it has moisturizer on after it
looking to try the age arrest moisturizer as well :
i put it on over my moisturizer
love the physical sunscreen block properties.
i just need a little concealer
i blend this with the no bronzer bronzer to get the right shade for my darker skin tone
use no other foundation or powder with it-- just a concealer under my eyes
then set it all with tinted spf loose powder sunscreen
depending on what powder sunscreen you add
highlighting with a lighter concealer fixes it perfectly
i do use a moisturizer underneath
this foundation serum is like the love child of a tinted moisturizer/bb cream
i would always only use concealer for spot treatment because i didn't wanna wear a heavy mask all over my skin
all i need is to brush a little bronzer
the only thing you need to use with it is a good concealer
the "no highlighter" highlighter
i just use bronzer and blush.
i would need too much bronzer to look good
'm wondering how the no concealer concealer might combine with this to give a little more coverage when needed
you can modify the tint by adding the bronzer
or adding the highlighter
like how your face looks just after applying moisturizer
skincare is what i splurge on
started adding a drop or two to my moisturizer
that's ok because it blends really well with almost any concealer
it is great on its own with concealer under the eyes
this is nice for a little color when mixed with a sunscreen moisturizer
mix a few drops with sunscreen moisturizer
i can use it match my face to my tan
best of all it doesn't make my skin oily like other moisturizers
even when using sensitive skin moisturizer
for the guys having trouble with this product try the oil free facial lotion
it's great daily moisturizer.
with this product i used do those 4 days as a replacement for my moisturizer
i am planning on purchasing this as my moisturizer
most are just another cream/serum/gel
i followed it with my moisturizer
follow up with a mattifying moisturizer after it dries
flaky even it i used it with a heavy moisturizer
mix two or three drops in with my moisturizer
then use a lightweight moisturizer on top of it
i've resorted to using this as a light nighttime moisturizer
i love this lotion.
this moisturizer is amazing- at least for my skin type
this moisturizer is very light
it's a moisturizing cream that i can use day or night without the heaviness of other creams
then apply a moisturizer on top
my eyeliner and concealer stay put.
this eye cream is great.
concealer slides on like a dream.
this is a great eye cream.
for an anti aging eye cream i think this is great
i've tried many eye creams/gels that promised to help with dark circles without much success
i love this gel cream.
my undereye skin has been really dry lately making my concealer look bad
i wanted something extremely moisturizing that would wear well under makeup
that doesn't make my eye concealer pill up or separate
love this eye cream
my favorite eye cream.
this eye cream is perfect for that.
we could see spots of dry skin under my eyes when i was applying my concealer
would not recommend immediate concealer application after applying
i love this cream!
i love this as an eye cream.
it helps my concealer go on a lot smoother
i love this eye cream!
sometimes my other eye creams have created a weird texture with my concealer or foundation
i really like this eye cream.
works beautifully under concealer
applying makeup on top of this gel cream also looks amazing
i love this eye gel.
this gel cream is awesome
this was my first experience with a gel eye cream
this is a wonderful eye moisturizer with an equally great price
sits nicely under concealer
this is an amazing eye cream
especially when i apply concealer on my dark circles
this eye creme is great for nighttime!
i love this cream!
noticed my undereyes were looking a bit crepey after using concealer
i love this eye cream.
i love this eye cream!
applying eyeshadows was impossible
i love this eye gel!
a positive is that it doesn't make my corrector or concealer crease
flaky looking undereyes when i wear concealer
this is a nice eye cream.
this gel-cream is exactly what i need: not oily
its a good eye moisturizer that i can say
she told me this was an amazing moisturizer for your eyes
i wear a few creams
this eye gel cream is amazing
i love this eye cream.
this is the best combo eye cream ever
major plus: spf in the day cream!
i love the night cream
i could live without the day cream which smells like a mixture of sunscreen
the day cream is everything!
i love this eye cream!!!!
these are the best eye creams i have ever used
i could tell a difference in moisturizing immediately after application
i really love both the am and pm eye creams.
you are getting two creams for this price
i will say the day side has a brightener
maybe it is the sunscreen
i love this eye cream.
day creams where some other eye creams go for $100
loved everything about these creams.
how to apply eye cream
this is the best eye cream.
you are getting two creams at $75 each
i love how both eye creams are in one package!
the day cream is amazing.
i love the fact that the day cream not only has spf
finally a day eye cream with spf
the night cream also works wonders <3
probably because of the sunscreen
i love the spf in the day cream
it also works very well under under-eye concealer
i slathered in some moisturizer
just make sure you moisturize extra morning
then rinse follow up with a nice moisturizer usu
not so much your routine facial moisturizer couldn't h
i can't wait to add this to my regular skin care regimen
i put it on under my moisturizer at night
love this eye gel.
i am new to eye creams.
this eye gel is nice to use
one of the best eye creams ever
it is a night cream
as someone said "like hairspray" below
i applied the eye cream
i still need an undereye moisturizer
the gel formula keeps you from rubbing the cream in
this is my absolute favorite under eye gel for nighttime
i've found there are now more days that i don't need concealer under my eyes
i would definitely recommend this gel
creams are best for under makeup/for daytime.
i do like the gel
i keep reading all these reviews that this eye cream makes your concealer crease
i also bought the daytime one which is a cream formula
it's a gel which sits atop the skin rather than a moisturizer
i'd rather add some moisturizer
i didn't wanna spend $$$ on getting a microdermabrasion facial
i did top it off with a gel moisturizer
i will always have this mask in my skincare routine
i only wish that the exfoliating bits were bigger
i didn't realize it was an exfoliator at first
concealer making my makeup look so much better
now my husband does not have a skincare regimen.
did apply a gel moisturizer on him--just that one night
then follow with a moisturizer
it is the best exfoliating mask i have tried.
any sort of exfoliating treatment/mask has made my skin smoother for maybe a day
just use a heavy moisturizer
now that my moisturizer can truly absorb into my skin
i used it a bit like an exfoliator
this one is definitely my favorite exfoliating mask i've ever tried
this is definitely a must to have in your skincare regimen
with a good moisturizer it is totally worth it
or even mascara all the way
you definitely need a moisturizer after using this
i can now use a very small amount of moisturizer that just glides over my skin
nothing a little moisturizer can't fix!
i definitely recommend using a moisturizer after this product because it can dry you out
i don't wear waterproof mascara
regular mascara as well as long-wearing eyeshadows
i love this moisturizer.
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
i will never buy a different moisturizer again!
i usually do not spend this much on moisturizer
you want to use moisturizer
my routine used to be: splurge on some new expensive cream
this moisturizer is a life saver.
i also don’t think i’d use it to moisturize under makeup
the oily texture might make concealer or foundation slide right off
none of my other night time moisturizers can hold a c
it is a great moisturizer for my super dry spots too
this is the best moisturizer my skin has a great glow
this cream will now be a part of my everyday regimen
i never found a moisturizer that really worked for me until i found this cream
this moisturizer is amazing.
i am very skeptical about creams and lotions.
i love this cream.
i like to use this cream when i travel
this face cream is rich
for years i've used one moisturizer
i've spent up to $300 on big name creams
finding this moisturizer has been the best thing for my skin
i follow with clinique smart moisturizer for dry to very dry skin
what works best for me is one pump of serum at bedtime
i follow with a serious moisturizer
it was thicker than most serums
this is one of my favorite serums
then follow it up with my beenigma moisturizer
but i put moisturizer after applying this serum.
if you typically spend this much money on skincare
i think it's really important to use serums
then apply my moisturizer
i decided to finish the bottle before going back to my retinol regimen
concealer i can feel the eye area is firmer already
definitely use some kind of moisturizer underneath
i love this moisturizer.
i am a daily waterproof mascara user.
the mascara rinses off
what broke me out was the bobbi brown lotion.
i usually wear waterproof mascara
moisturizer the kit includes leaves my skin the softest
i love this eye cream!
i like this lotion.
i wasn't even shopping for eye cream
at 25 this seems like a great wrinkle prevention eye cream
this is the best eye cream i've ever used!
i would say this eye cream works for me in ways other eye creams have not
i decided to get the eye cream
it's lightweight and perfect under concealer.
my concealer sits better too
this is the best eye cream i have used.
it is heavier weight...not a lotion.
i am getting the serum and night cream now.
i love this cream.
this cream is light
i really needed a moisturizer that didn't add to that
after i apply this moisturizer i apply the tarte primer
i really like this moisturizer.
searching for a new facial moisturizer
i love this cream.
an expensive face lotion
the day cream is lightweight
then apply serum or lotion of choice
make sure to moisturizer after!
i find i don't need my normal moisturizer after this because it leaves my skin very moisturized
it's not just a regular exfoliator or scrub to keep normal skin in check
i think my moisturizer works better after this.
my moisturizer took care of that
compare to another moisturizer cream that i used to use
i really like this cream
this creme sure works
i've had no trouble with the moisturizer at all
follow up with the ibuki moisturizer
used it at night with moisturizer over it
i am a serum/moisturizer junkie
i don't use moisturizer on top of this in the am.
before i put on moisturizer
not realizing this is supposed to be used before your moisturizers
in the morning as a moisturizer
i really like shiseido's skincare line
it is the very first step in my daytime skincare routine
it's just a nice "layering" effect to your skincare regimen
and any eye cream didn't work.
when i use a moisturizer after this then it's too much
have to use moisturizer after it, though!
like vitamins for your face
this concentrate made my serums
moisturizer work in overtime
this is a nice skin drink serum to use prior to primer or sunscreen
moisturizer i use after
this cream has saved my skin.
it is not a moisturizer
this may be all you need skipping the moisturizer
i fell in love with this moisturizer the first time i used it
overall, i like this moisturizer.
puts this moisturizer on it helps within minutes
i used the lotion in the fall
the smell of the cream is way better than the lotion
great cream for night!
this cream is a bit greasy.
the cream is a little greasy
moisturizers my skin like no other product i've tried before
i usual use clinique super defense moisturizer
this is a great lotion for fall
i started using this moisturizer as well as the lotion/toner in the same line
i find that it works like a nice calming lotion.
also great to use at night before moisturizer.
which is essentially a thick moisturizer
i follow it with my usual moisturizer
i love how it turns from a lotion to an oil
the "film" will help a moisturizer to soak in so much better than normal
days that my skin is extra dry like in the winter i will add my favorite heavy moisturizer after washing
like you already put on a thin layer of light moisturizer
i wear waterproof eyeliner most of the time
follow with serum/moisturizer as usual
combined with algenist's tinted moisturizer
all of my mascara comes off
takes off waterproof mascara
goes on like a balm
still use your regular moisturizer
i do not wear a ton of makeup to begin with just tinted moisturizer
use this with algenist moisturizer what a wonderful pair
if i don't follow immediately with moisturizer
sometimes a diifferent remover for waterproof mascara
i tried swapping out moisturizers to check if that was the difference
i got plumping of wrinkles even when not using an algenist moisturizer
i actually enjoy this step in my skincare routine
the best eye cream ever!
this is one of the best eye creams i have ever used
love this eye cream!!
i would have liked a better moisturizing cream
have always been religious about sunscreen
which is always a concern with a new moisturizer
this is the best eye cream i've ever used
feel of this eye cream
can be used as a 360 eye cream
moisturizing that i will definitely be putting on my wish list
great to use as night eye cream
tinted moisturizer can just glide on
therefore making concealer really crease
i always like to try new creams
moisturizer that wouldn't burn my itchy
in the winter you'll need moisturizer after this
can add on the moisturizer right afterwards
i just cover it up with the mushroom moisturizer
/or sunscreen off well
it just feels like you just put on a intense moisturizer
almost as if i don't need to apply moisturizer
lashes to get mascara off
even the most waterproof mascara
depending on how thick i applied my mascara i had to use some coconut oil as a reinforcement
i followed it up with the nurture me moisturizer
this is the only product so far that easily removes kylie jenner's matte lipstick
so good at removing mascara
made sure to rub my waterproof mascara with it.
no scrubbing to get off even the toughest waterproof mascara
i wear a ton of mascara
long wear liquid lipstick
benefit they're real mascara
whatever my favorite moisturizer is at the time
everything was gone including my mascara
in fact doesn't even fell like i need moisturizer after
that is what makes it such a good moisturizer
i wear hard core waterproof mascara
follow with a bit of moisturizer
it is also a great base for concealer.
i also wanted to start using something with retinol
i started using this eye cream
i now can find concealers that actually work!
i give the product 4 stars instead of 5 because the consistency is that of a body lotion
i love this eye cream.
-out-there--i've found this retinol eye cream very good
this is the first night cream i've found that is still hydrating my skin when i wake up
i recently started adding 5 drops of josie maran argan oil to the lotion before application
it is heavier than some face creams for sure
i don't like spending money trying expensive serums
sometimes you need more than just lotion
she uses it underneath her moisturizer
for my mom that is concealer which she uses as foundation
i love how it makes my skin look the next day after exfoliating
it works very well when combined with another moisturizer too
this is the best moisturizer that i i have ever used h
never happy with moisturizers with spf
it is a really great moisturizer.
i normally would never spend this much on a moisturizer
good moisturizer to use for sensitive skin
i love this moisturizer.
i hate sunscreen that stings my skin or eyes
came across this sunscreen
i think this is a great sunscreen for aging
the face finishing moisturizer
the pre:empt oil free moisturizer
sometimes just the no lipstick lipstick
this is not a moisturizer and neither is the ovm.
my usual moisturizer wasn't cutting it.
i swear it keeps my moisturizer more active.
a few hours with nude skincare progenius™ treatment oil is what it takes
during the winter i can layer it with my face finishing moisturizer too
no matter what moisturizers
use before face finishing moisturizer
it is like a deep moisturizer for night.
i tried everything from regular face moisturizer to straight up vaseline
with this plus a strong day time moisturizer
this is my go to night moisturizer!
i just slather this on
wasn't sure how i would like this mask/moisturizer
my favorite way to use this is after exfoliating!
oned all other night time moisturizers
this is a really great moisturizer.
i will never use another moisturizer/mask again!
i've tried so many moisturizers
i put it on after my moisturizer has soaked into my skin
plus it locks in the hydration from my moisturizer
if used very sparingly as a moisturizer topper will last forever as it's 100ml rather than the 50ml you usually get with face masks
lotion which i love
feels the same as a night time moisturizer.
sometimes i just use it as a moisturizer.
i love this cream mask!!!!
now it's my new before-bed moisturizer
slightly thicker than my normal moisturizer
it perfectly moisturizers overnight for brighter perfected skin that actually feels like a million bucks
it feels like a moisturizer
this is the most amazing moisturizing mask i have ever bought
this time i tried using it as a night-time moisturizer
used it as a regular moisturizer
i tried this mask on top of my moisturizer
this moisturizer is amazing!
so once winter comes i am always in desperate need of a super rich moisturizer
i mix this with my normal moisturizer or use it as a mask on top
the enlighten moisturizer cream for my post acne dark spots
make sure to use a sunscreen
the matching moisturizer cream
would suggest to anyone using or trying this to mix your moisturizer in with the serum
i love this cream.
chose this eye cream
i prefer thicker serums.
it's also moisturizing enough that i can wear it alone at night
i like that i don't have to put a moisturizer over the serum like most serums instruct
i pair it with aveeno's clear complexion moisturizer at night
moisturizer which is also amazing
it balances very well for me with the acne fighting moisturizer
before moisturizer with spf
this serum really is what my skin needed
not oily like all the moisturizers i used
i apply it after i do my deep exfoliating with exfolikate
almost every moisturizer breaks me out
i usually avoid moisturizer at all cost
i initially tried this because i find night creams/lotions too heavy for my skin
applied my normal moisturizer
not as a daily moisturizer
my face seemed more moisturizer
applying my usual lotion
probably the most effective nighttime hydrating cream i have ever encountered
i then add my moisturizer.
the balls are not exfoliating which i noticed is an option below
i changed to a tinted moisturizer
ditched the lotion for good
i then add my moisturizer.
you also need to massage your face with this lotion to get the result you want
i love that you can layer it with other serums or mix it in to your daily moister cream
sunscreen are still necessary
when used under moisturizer
i do use a moisturizer on top of it
put my moisturizer over it so all i smell if my face lotion
always have a problem with my concealer creasing no matter what i set it with
i decided to mix it in with my first aid beauty moisturizer that i love
i tried applying this before moisturizer as suggested on label
i noticed my moisturizer did not absorb as well.
then add my vitamin c spf moisturizer i have gotten several compliments with the just the first week of using it
i put a few drops on before my moisturizer in the am
changed my daily moisturizer
beautiful instant firming beauty shot is the favorite part of my skin regimen
i where it over eye concealer
i follow it with my moisturizer.
i saw this moisturizer
my skin was so dry that lotion
the serum i use before makeup with a moisturizer.
it is a great nighttime moisturizer.
this is my favorite deep moisturizer ever.
this is my go-to moisturizer when my skin is stressed or irritated
use the balm at night as my moisturizer a few times a week
the moisturizer was great i got it in a trial set with the am
it was fantastic the moisturizer was very light
it's more like a lotion
this coupled with a good sunscreen will aid in brightening
that's what works best for heavy mascara with no harsh rubbing
the water drop moisturizer
i dont feel the need to apply a moisturizer right after it
i do not wear waterproof mascara
i do wear waterproof eyeliner
i also put this on a q-tip to clean all the eyeliner smudgies on my eyelash curler
rinsing gets the remainder of mascara since i wear a lot
now i just need to find a daytime moisturizer that does the same thing
3 oz which is double what u would normally get for any moisturizer
serums to get my dull
fresh is becoming my most fav go to moisturizer.
this mask/moisturizer is h
i still have a thin layer of moisturizer which feels great when i'm washing my face
not only does it moisturize my skin during the night
so far this is the best moisturizer for combination skin tone
if there's one thing to invest in it is skincare
apply it like u would a moisturizer
i love this night cream!!!
paired with the tarte maracuja creaseless concealer
had spent a good portion of my 20's in the sun sans sunscreen
as a moisturizer in the morning before putting on my makeup
crepe-like texture under my eyes before applying concealer
my concealer doesn't crease or budge after application
as they tend to disappear after i moisturize my skin
this cream works wonders!
(in addition to my face and eye serums) love!
i never expect anything with these wrinkle creams
works great - if you are using botox.
in combo with regular botox
in my opinion this works better than botox for me
i do use excellent skincare
botox doesn't work on me
i think i would have to keep using the cream to maintain wrinkle free skin
it's part of my morning skincare routine under foundation
make your botox last longer
i always used sunblock
i am a committed moisturizer
i also stepped my game up by adding the volcasmic matte moisturizer in the morning
i changed my moisturizer
get a good moisturizer to pair with it
it's definitely earned a permanent place in my skincare routine
takes off all spf, waterproof makeup and mascara.
only use it once daily with a moisturizer after
after moisturizer your skin texture will bounce back
this moisturizer does not make my face shiny at all
it is drying though so definitely use a moisturizer when done
you really should be moisturizing after anyway
mportant to invest in your skincare
don't put on moisturizer after this
i need more moisturizer than usual
this is definitely one of my favorite skincare products
i put it on top of my moisturizer before going to bed
i apply my regular face moisturizer
one drop of this in my moisturizer before application
i've never used oil as a moisturizer before
pressed into the skin under a moisturizer
the aromatherapy aspect of this oil just before bedtime is incredible
even waterproof mascara gently massaging it into my skin
before i had massage minutes before the moisturizer can be fully absorbed
took off my waterproof mascara.
a second lotion is not necessary half the time
it will take off waterproof mascara
i don't have to layer tons of moisturizer anymore
it seems like a gel / cream consistency at first
first time using this moisturizer
huge fan of this moisturizer!
i love this daily moisturizer.
i do like this moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
my quest for a great moisturizer has come to an end
it is the only moisturizer i've ever had that makes my face feel so refreshed
i really like this moisturizer it makes my skin feel great
i really love this moisturizer.
this isn't the deepest moisturizer or thickest cream by any means
i've always had issues finding a moisturizer right for my skin
so i started trying out face moisturizers.
i love that this moisturizer has aha.
i do not like the heavy feeling of creams
this is my go to morning moisturizer.
this is by far my favorite moisturizer.
try kiehl's ultra facial moisturizer because i've heard so many great things
i've never been more pleased with a moisturizer.
this moisturizer makes my skin feel smooth
i really love this moisturizer.
it's a perfect moisturizer for my oily skin.
this moisturizer is by far the best i have tried.
absolutely love this moisturizer
i tried out different moisturizers
i am in love with this moisturizer!
this is my moisturizer.
i might add in a weekly moisturizing serum or something
my holy grail moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer for every day use.
my favorite moisturizer ever!!
this is the perfect everyday moisturizer
the use of this cream
you do need to put on the sunscreen with it
i also use it as a night time moisturizer.
this moisturizer is lightweight
love love this moisturizer.
this is my favorite moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer i've ever had!
this is my favorite daily moisturizer.
one of my favorite moisturizers.
very good moisturizer for combination skin.
this is my current favorite moisturizer.
my gel moisturizer was no longer working
i enjoy using this moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer.
i always have trouble finding a great moisturizer to use
hope in a jar has made me less scared of face moisturizers
definetly my favorite moisturizer!
this is the most amazing moisturizer i've ever tried
i can't believe how amazing this lotion is!
lotion it feels so good
it's a nice light moisturizer day or night
my expectations for a moisturizer
hiaj oil free with spf is the only other day time moisturizer i'll use
this is my go-to night time moisturizer.
i prefer to wear a different moisturizer during the day
i did not have any problems with this moisturizer
works great as my morning moisturizer prior to applying primer
best moisturizer i have ever used.
or if i exfoliate my face too hard
after a few weeks of not having any moisturizer my skin was dry
this moisturizer is perfect for oily skin.
this is the best moisturizer i can find
great moisturizer for every morning and night.
i really like this moisturizer.
i love this eye cream!
moisturizers that won't irritate them
use concealer for dark circles
this is an amazing eye cream!
perfect everyday eye cream
this eye cream is amazing
i just need an eye cream to moisturize my eye area
this is my first eye cream purchase
i love this new eye cream.
it actually helped moisturize my skin from a 13 hour flight
gets off tough mascara.
left my skin feeling moisturizer
i do slather on sunscreen
a couple dots of concealer where i need it
usually after washing my face i have to do moisturizer
and i didn't really need moisturizer even.
there is a bit of trouble with mascara
yesterday it took off a cream-gel eyeshadow
i usually apply a light moisturizer to my combo skin
dry after washing leaving my skin begging for my moisturizer
please try shiseido urban environment oil-free moisturizer
i do need to follow up with a moisturizer
moisturizer my skin afterwards as well!
especially the water-proof mascara
for mascara i use the lančome hypnôse drama waterproof mascara
even seems to allow my moisturizer to absorb better
if i am using a sunscreen with tint or a foundation
if i don't moisturize at night
my skin hardly accepts any moisturizing product.
love that this doesnt make my creams break up
do not use with other moisturizers
i apply it at night at the end of my makeup routine as my moisturizer
heavy moisturizers tend to do nothing
i add a couple of drops to my moisturizer in the evening
sometimes i'll put a drop in my moisturizer in the morning
this replaces my moisturizer
moisturizer is just what the doctor ordered for my dry winter skin
if only it had spf i would never use another lotion or product
sunscreen with my foundation
if it is super cold outside i mix the oil with the de sunscreen
you can use alone or along with a moisturizer.
i've tried every moisturizer you can think of
tight feeling once the moisturizer has sunk in
doesn't feel heavy like other night time moisturizers i've used
great all around moisturizer.
i still use a heavier moisturizer on top of this oil on my dry cheeks
night in the moisturizer
if you want just a simple oil to add to your skincare routine
sunscreen for daily use
i tried to cover it with concealer
apply that mixture before moisturizer
preps the skin so nicely for my moisturizer or night cream
then the facial oil as my nighttime moisturizer
this is a great product for pregnant women to use when they can't use retinol
every prescription under the sun
the de moisturizer with it if i'm having a dry day
one of the best eye creams ever.
moisturize my face every night
comfortable under a night moisturizer
very far away from that one moisturizer
i think as an exfoliator, it does a great job.
a good night time moisturizer
always follow this with a good moisturizer
then i let it dry and apply moisturizer on top.
follow up with my belief moisture bomb moisturizer
any moisturizer will do the trick
i will definitely add this to my skincare routine
something i will definitely keep in my skincare routine
gel moisturizer which i also love.
after all, it is nicer skincare product.
thick night time moisturizer
sunscreen at the end of the day
which makes it feel like i am washing my face with some moisturizer
my normal skincare nude products wasn't working
i do follow up with a moisturizer
a nice light moisturizer afterwards makes this product perfect for me
even though i've upped my moisturizer to be thicker/richer
when i put moisturizer on now
on it's own is a perfect exfoliator
moisturizer at the same time
apply a retinol at night
it doesn't dry out my skin making me use moisturizer
before my usual moisturizer around my eyes
i've always been told that exfoliating your skin is best during the night
follow with toner moisturizer etc
if you want it to be more exfoliating
a tea tree crème as my moisturizer
so happy to have found this bar to add to my skincare regimen
the only thing to work was the pill
which was probably my first expensive oil/moisturizer
only a few drops twice a day under the moisturizer
i am not a skincare trend person
i am a bit of a skincare snob
really essential to my morning skincare routine
in the winter i'll probably add a moisturizer on top
smoother than when i only use moisturizer
have been enjoying using this as my summer moisturizer
follow with a light moisturizer
t is good to still use with a moisturizer
last thing at night under my normal moisturizers
then on goes some moisturizer to help face the day
finish it off with the greek yogurt moisturizer
even the waterproof mascara
i feel like i'm washing my face with a moisturizer
just a luxurious treat to pamper yourself daily with this wonderful product
sunscreen blended on like a breeze
it washes off mascara
mascara without staining my skin
no matter how much i try to exfoliate
a sephora beauty rep helped me find this great product that i use along with the korres greek yoghurt moisturizer
along with the korres moisturizer
it's wonderful at breaking down makeup- even waterproof mascara
rub it a little bit to remove my mascara
plus it seems to moisturize even better :
definitely recommend this cleanser in combination with the moisturizer
it removes every last bit of waterproof mascara
perfectly priming it for concealer
what i love mixing this with is my undereye concealer
then dab my concealer on top
concealer doesn't look dry or cakey or even crease-y
on top of your concealer
don't put on my concealer without it now.
if you use any benefit concealers
a lot better than using a ton of under eye concealer
that is what sold me- i tend to put on heavy concealer to cover the dark circles
works well as a concealer primer under the eye
it prevented my concealer from creasing
i put my concealer over this
it makes a difference in my concealer from creasing
it also makes my concealer go on like a dream
i still use a concealer daily
by time i get to my concealer it's absorbed
as whatever your moisturizer does to the other skin on your face
this is not an eye cream.
i love it because i don't like wearing heavy concealer
my concealer used to always crease
my concealer always seems to crease
it is not a concealer.
make my concealer smooth
love the lotion, love the applicator.
i then use my under eye concealer over top.
right over my concealer, no problem.
when you want to put your concealer after it blends perfectly
put all my concealer on
if i use a heavy moisturizer on it
the perfect moisturizer that i've ever seen
also works well under your makeup primer or moisturizer
my favorite product that they offer is the daily moisturizer
it's the only moisturizer i've found that is lightweight
this moisturizer has become part of my daily skincare routine
this moisturizer is a dream.
considering that i like a moisturizer with a high spf
was spending twice the amount for revive's moisturizer with an equivalent spf
after using my moisturizer my face just feels so soft
i would never use this alone without a moisturizing routine
this serum does not dry skin at all
use this alone or mixed into moisturizer or foundation for a boost of hydration
absolutely recommend this as a daily moisturizer.
this serum also sits well under other skin care products such as moisturizer
i've only ever just used moisturizer on its own
it goes great under any moisturizer
never a problem with this moisturizer
feels moisturized after applying even if it isn't a moisturizer
night before my normal moisturizer
overall, it's a good precursor to my moisturizer.
be sure to put on your moisturizer of choice after
5 ounce size of a moisturizer i wanted to try out
well, i hate the moisturizer- it breaks me out.
don't have to wait to long to put moisturizer on after
when you don't need a moisturizer, this is it!
works wonderful under moisturizer or on top as a makeup primer
then layer moisturizer on top
can tell the difference it made to my skincare
it's perfect under a moisturizer
i noticed that my skin wasn't absorbing my moisturizer as well as it used to
i find i need to use less moisturizer or oil afterwards
before moisturizer at the origins counter
i actually really like this serum i only use it in my skincare morning routine
i love pairing this product with my over night moisturizer
it feels even better once i put my night cream on for extra moisturizing
so finding a moisturizer is difficult enough.
before i apply my moisturizer
something seems to be making my tinted moisturizer "pill" or form those little flesh-colored balls as i apply/blend my tm
night under my moisturizer
i do need to add a moisturizer as winter in mn is brutal on the skin
best used as a moisturizer rather than a mask :
moisturizer i loved the feel of my skin
when you remove the mask there's still a thin film of moisturizer left
no moisturizer i tried helped
decided to follow with my skincare regimen before going to bed
the light controlling lotion keep it in check
purchased this balm and it is amazing!!!!!
so make sure you follow with a good moisturizer
easily fixed by a moisturizer
i just use my face cream
ready to soak in any moisturizer/serum
light control lotion are perfection as well
just make sure to have a good moisturizer
so getting him to use a moisturizer is next on my list
do recommend it be used with a moisturizer
does not remove waterproof mascara.
i do not even need to use a moisturizer which is great because moisturizers tend to make my acne breakouts worse
helps your moisturizer to absorb better
by using a good moisturizer afterwards takes care of that for me
even my waterproof mascara
recommend using a moisturizer afterwards
especially after putting on my fresh face moisturizer
which made me use a heavier moisturizer
including stubborn non waterproof mascara
sunscreen are a must when using these products
i love this eye cream!
the good thing is it has moisturizing ingredients in it so at least you don't have to use a separate eye cream over top for moisture
easily fixed by applying my moisturizer after applying the eye cream
as well as every concealer
it has brightened my circles enough that i don't have to wear concealer any longer
this cream is a miracle for me.
i've tried every under-eye cream from clinique to sephora
this lotions does not give my alergy.
the product is really like a balm rather than a gel or cream
although i still have to use a concealer for the under eye circles
the only drawback is that applying concealer over power k can be tricky
absolutely the best eye cream ever!!
the kind where under eye concealer is needed everyday
i needed a great eye cream
i just use moisturizer after i am all done
i do use a great moisturizer afterwards from f
i would also like a moisturizer to match?
i find every day is over-exfoliating for me.
spend a little more time lathering it
i like to follow with a moisturizer
i would suggest using with a moisturizer
would not call it an exfoliator really
this combined with clinique moisture surge moisturizer has completely cleared my skin in just about 2 weeks
it did a nice job on the layer of sunscreen
may just pick up a full size once my josie m exfoliating powder is finished
the mask and moisturizer are awesome, too.
toner/moisturizer/primer/foundation
nothing moisturizer can't fix.
like i already put a light moisturizer on
i happened to see an ad for a new glamglow moisturizing product
it moisturized my face well enough that i could skip the jojoba oil
glowing after applying moisturizer to my dry skin
i always use a moisturizer after.
i treat myself to this luxe wash
i got this as part of the hydrating gift set
i would apply concealer
this eye cream is life changing.
a good eye cream makes a huge difference when wearing a concealer
light weight moisturizer that last through out the day
use the rose gel cream during the day when i don't want to layer so much under my concealer
so do my eyeshadows
i love this moisturizer.
this is a nice eye cream for 20-35
less of concealer under my eyes
this eye cream is amazing.
in the morning before i apply my under-eye concealer
it is perfect underneath my concealer it is not too greasy
i am a realist when it comes to eye creams
allows my concealer to go on smoothly
that's what my concealer is for
i decided to try this eye cream
i no longer have to worry about concealer looking dry on me
i mix 2 pumps with my night time moisturizer
this is the perfect moisturizer for me as it is lightweight
this is my go-to winter moisturizer.
is a highly effective "go to" moisturizer
the only moisturizer i don't fear putting on my skin
i absolutely love the nude skincare line.
this is the best skincare line out there
this serum/lotion/whatever it is makes my skin feel so smooth
kind of like a thick cream more than a serum
as a moisturizer in the summer
i totally recommend this for after chemical peel moisturizer
it is nice to have a good moisturizer that is made with a vegan formula
works wonderfully like a serum under a moisturizer or alone over toner overnight
night pair with my kate somerville moisturizer
moisturizers i use will leave me waking up with an oily face
even with heavy moisturizer
overall i'm glad this is a newbie in my skincare routine
i've skipped the moisturizing step because my skin feels that good
almost feels conditioned after removing the waterproof mascara
eye liner, mascara, eyeshadow, foundation).
it's perfect for removing waterproof mascara
waterproof mascara much easier than using a cotton round
i got this set to try the lotion
i still use an oil-free moisturizer
it does a fantastic job of removing all of my sunscreen
other than eyeliner/mascara
although i do not recommend it for mascara
i usually wear waterproof makeup and eyeliner .
bronzer on my neck
she said it was likely because i was no exfoliating
either jurlique beauty oil or first aid beauty moisturizer
i've used both the glam glow illuminating moisturizer
i just use it on top of my regular moisturizer
it serves as my moisturizer with sun protection
i never thought i would like/use a tint moisturizer
overall it's a great moisturizer
love the bonus of sunscreen.
don't forget the blush and bronzer !
perfect amount of moisturizer for daytime.
i would need other color from bronzer
my face feels moisturizer all day
tried out more affordable moisturizers
i give this product 4 stars vs 5 stars because the tint of the moisturizer stains my nail polish color every time upon application
this light weight moisturizer is like putting whipped cream on my face
the combo of spf 30 with moisturizer is perfect for me
s down the best moisturizer i've ever used
i love this moisturizer!!!
i do put added sunscreen on in the summer
i love this tinted moisturizer!
went into sephora asking for a daytime moisturizer with spf that would still help with my oiliness/combo skin
it's not a tinted moisturizer
this is the best tinted moisturizer
one of the best moisturizers i have ever used
wouldn't be used as "tinted moisturizer"
best tinted moisturizer i have ever tried
this tinted moisturizer has changed all that
i've never just gone with a tinted moisturizer instead of foundation or a bb cream
it's the best tinted moisturizer i have ever used
this is like moisturizer
my face tends to get oily with tinted moisturizers
it now replaces my expensive dior moisturizer
i do not feel the weight of the sunscreen which is so nice
i am in heaven with this moisturizer
my skincare regimen is strictly perricone.
i love this moisturizer because now i can use one product
i love that it is like using my favorite face finishing moisturizer
i noticed right away it helped my skin retain moisture when i applied under my belif moisturizer
this new tinted moisturizer is a must have.
the best night moisturizer i've ever used
if you use retinol
wait about an hour after applying the retinol
it's a perfect everyday moisturizer that helps with dry patches
i actually like this moisturizer far better
this is one of the best moisturizers i've tried
estee lauder moisturizers have something that no other moisturizers have
the previous moisturizers i was using
stiff so obviously i need a moisturizer
this moisturizer lives up to its description.
got this as a deluxe sample as i love trying moisturizers
i tested this out mostly because i wanted a moisturizer to wear under my sunscreen
when i applied my sunscreen it blended right in
putting moisturizer on top once it dries
serums are a little tacky right out of the bottle = normal
this serum has done wonders for my skin.
let your skin absorb the serum before applying your moisturizer
apply to my problem areas on my face before moisturizer
i don't need a moisturizer afterwards
doesn't cause any pilling when applying moisturizer
/or sunscreen on top
cream i swear i can feel my skin "working"
i used it only in the morning under my regular moisturizer
must follow with your moisturizer of choice!
i suspect it would be lovely under a daytime moisturizer
s wearing only touché éclat as an undereye concealer
i follow up with my favorite moisturizer
i follow that up with a very light spf 30 lotion
a fine or light lotion
i would rate 5 stars if it were a bit more moisturizing
my skin is tan
use it before moisturizer
you can wear it under foundation/primer/bronzer/blush
my skin does not get enough moisture from this product as a moisturizer
adding this to my regular skincare regimen.
i feel this serum is good as a repair/perfect treatment for winter skin
i hate to spend a fortune on skincare
along with a light sunscreen
i wouldn't usually spend so much on a moisturizer
mix it with a little aloe vera or a cheaper moisturizer to spread it out
like a highlighter in a moisturizer!
it doesn't smell like sunscreen
this is my night cream
i don't want to do too much exfoliating
i enjoy having this as part of my skincare routine
now i actually have to dig around my makeup drawer for the concealer when i occasionally get a pimple
perfectly ready then for a serum and moisturizer.
my absolute favorite exfoliator.
this is the best exfoliator i have ever used.
this is an amazing exfoliator with just plain water
i prefer this to a much more expensive exfoliator i've been using for years
this powder is a little too exfoliating for me to use every day
this is the best exfoliator i have ever used
you can control how much exfoliating powder you need
it works amazing at exfoliating my lips with this terrible winter
the texture of this is more like a lotion then a serum
night as a lotion since it's still cold
my husband using this as well as his moisturizer.
clinique moisturizer or the clinique even better spf 15 lotion
can apply my moisturizer immediately after this product
in the morning the serum alone under sunscreen
i apply this in the morning before my moisturizer
best moisturizer i've ever used.
use this regularly along with a good moisturizer
this cream also has a mattifying affect
again at night before i use my bienfait night moisturizer cream
day cream as primer
then apply my regular cream
at night the use it, retinol cream the.
then put on sunscreen
moisturizer on top of that
does just fine before my evening moisturizer
once i put my moisturizer on its disappears
i do the basic skin care routinely: i wear sunscreen with spf 30 everyday
once you put on sunblock or bb cream
is this botox in a bottle?
use this with my eye cream.
try this eye cream
love this eye cream
am trying to pay more attention to my skincare
use eye cream everyday
i apply before my concealer
you do have to use a moisturizer under this
after applying my moisturizer
i love this product it's not an amazing magic moisturizer
really like this moisturizer
i love this moisturizer!
weighed down feeling of other moisturizers for dry skin
i feel the moisturizer 2oz.
the best skin cream i have ever used
if you tan in the summer
it's the perfect morning regimen.
this is the first moisturizer i've every used
i love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is everything!
i wanted/needed a moisturizer with an spf that would work for combination skin
this moisturizer makes my skin glow in the morning
this has been a perfect moisturizer
it is a great moisturizer
this moisturizer give me life.
went to the store for a recommendation on an eye cream to hydrate my red
would work well under concealer
i love this eye balm!
it's a balm...not a gel or cream.
it's super important to use a firming/hydrating eye cream while young so you don't get any of those fine lines
it does the job of a night eye cream
i find that using this overnight gives me enough moisture to wear a less moisturizing eye cream in the morning under my concealer
wearing concealer has just looked cakey because of the dryness
concealer looks smooth again
i really love this moisturizer!
works great with all of my favorite sephora moisturizers
this cream is a life saver for me.
was recommended this cream
it is a great heavy cream
i really like this balm.
my concealer goes on smoother the next morning
my concealer slides like a dream
sit easily under my night lotion
this is a great overnight balm.
my under eye concealer wears better in the morning
most eye creams give me mila
that's what concealer is for
i love this cream.
it is a good night moisturizer
wonderfully moisturizers without irritating my eyes like most products do
i also really enjoy that it's more like a balm than a lotion
absolutely love this eye cream!
i got a sample of this because of my retinol eye cream being too drying
my concealer goes on so smooth
eye cream for years
that my eyeshadow primer wasn't helping the situation
my eyeshadow would crack like i never seen before
my eyeshadow definitely didn't crack the entire day
use it as a moisturizer because it's pleasant
probably won't purchase again because my drug store moisturizer with spf is good enough
this cream is great!
at double the cost of ole henrickson sheer moisturizer
i used the amore pacific moisture bound creme as the first layer of moisturizer on my skin then i applied this genius whitening lotion on
hard to cover with concealer
along with the algenist daily defense lotion for daytime use
perfect for a summer lotion or before your cream
it is said cleanser can't brighten the skin because it only stays for 30 secs
i often find i don't even need a moisturizer on top
use that nightly as my moisturizer
tend to mix 2-3 drops with my moisturizer
also luna for me works better if i mix it in with a gel moisturizer
i love this skincare line.
on nights when i don't have time for my entire moisturizing regime
as long as i use a thicker moisturizer it's all good
i've even stopped wearing foundation-- just rely on concealer to cover up redness around my nose
then in the morning i use tidal as a moisturizer
i usually cover it with another moisturizer before bed
without good genes or with another moisturizer
serums leave me dry by morning time
do follow with a good moisturizer
in a hot dry climate i use it instead of night moisturizer
before moisturizer for 28 days
this moisturizer is amazing
a few drops every night under moisturizer.
i will apply my lancome moisturizer on top
i mix this with my moisturizer to help it go further
it certainly assists with my moisturizer
the serums do not only look pretty
using prescription creams daily with little improvements i decided to give this a try
i've never been one to leave the house without at least a tinted moisturizer on
wasn't an issue after i applied moisturizer
tonight i've reapplied and it just lovely.
much better than the prescription creams
have been using my biossance oil to moisturize on top at night
seriously you must use sunscreen with this stuff
then follow it up with my nighttime moisturizer
wanted to add a retinol to my regimen to speed up the fading process
ptr toning lotion because this is the only br
use a good sunscreen every day.
moisturizer in the day
i just added this to my nightly skincare regimen
then add a strong moisturizer
i always thought that ptr's retinol was great
i tried allot of different sunscreens for the face
since i find this spf cream i can use sunscreen everyday without irritating my skin
i do use a water based gel moisturizer under it
this is a great sunscreen and moisturizer in one!
must wear sunscreen daily even though i despise it
this is my absolute favorite sunscreen
it's perfect for your daily sunscreen.
put this on first and then my moisturizer.
help lock in my moisturizer
i love that it has a sunscreen
with the added benefit of sunscreen
like most good sunscreens do
it will be a staple in my beauty regimen.
or over top a very light weight moisturizer
it can start to pill
the rest of my body had regular sunscreen in spf 30
love this primer/sunscreen.
my go to sunscreen for my oily skin.
sunscreen all in one product
i love this moisturizer and sunscreen.
doesn't leave white marks like so many sunscreens
it's got skincare benefits
pairs well with or without moisturizer
need the sunscreen protection living in socal
i found with certain moisturizers it will
must be the anti-aging/sunscreen protection
i mix it with a cream sunblock to help smooth it on
every sunscreen i've come across has been greasy
forcing me to face the world wearing only my beloved spf 15 tinted moisturizer
all spf moisturizer breaks me out except for this one
love this silky sunscreen!
i hate thick creams
it's a great primer with the benefit of sunscreen
it is definitely my favorite morning skincare item
i cannot get foundation or concealer to work with this as it has dried by then
this was a great buy to replace traditional sunscreens
and it just makes it easy to use sunscreen.
this one doesn't smell like sunscreen
currently using this moisturizer daily in the am
it's one of the better moisturizers i'i have tried
it's the best daily moisturizer
this product is my holy grail moisturizer for both day
day moisturizers that i have bought at sephora
i wanted to try a different moisturizer the sa was amazing
this face cream is really moisturising.
with no other moisturizer added to the regimen
after using this moisturizer combined with laura mercier's translucent powder for baking it worked amazing
this moisturizer was basically scent-free
dr: the best moisturizer in my opinion out there
after years of searching for the perfect matte moisturizer i have finally found my holy grail
this moisturizer combined with laura mercier's translucent powder for baking is a game changer
this is the third time i have purchased this moisturizer
this is a great daytime moisturizer i use before my primer
it's a nice lotion like gel that cools your face when you apply it
i like this gel for my combo skin.
this is the only moisturizer in the history of moisturizers that i have ever bought more then once
i love this moisturizer on my combination skin
while i don't consider this to be a typical mattifying gel
goes on top of your moisturizer to keep you shine-free
this was the only moisturizer i could st
i felt the need to state how amazing this moisturizer is
for whatever reason this moisturizer works.
will either add a drop or two of a facial oil or use a heavier moisturizer
it also lays nicely under makeup whether it's a tinted moisturizer/bb cream or heavier foundation
for me, this gel did not make my skin matte.
but as a moisturizer, it is really good.
i love this moisturizer!
so going without lotion
i decided to give the mattifying gel a try.
sunscreen then go outside
unlike other gel moisturizers it doesn't leave skin feeling tacky
i feel this moisturizer is a diamond in the rough
i didn't purchase this moisturizer with the intent to use as a primer
needed a moisturizer that would help my oily/combo skin
want to avoid a moisturizer with sunscreen in it
this moisturizer has changed my life!
definitely my new daytime moisturizer as i use the belif peat moisturizer at night
i also use it as a moisturizer before bed.
not only is this a fabulous moisturizer
is a good moisturizer especially for daytime
this moisturizer is a 2 in 1 since it works as a primer as well
this has become my hg moisturizer
i hate the smell of sunscreen.
this is the best moisturizer for my combination skin
i love this moisturizer because of the fact that it is water-based
many of the cream moisturizers are too heavy for my skin
it's been a month that i've been using this moisturizer daily
this moisturizer is great for my sensitive/oily/combination/acne prone skin
like most moisturizers do
i've used other moisturizers in the past that always left my skin greasy
this gel moisturizer works against oily skin under your makeup for a nice mattifying look all day long
it's a great moisturizer for sensitive skin.
the last thing i want to do is slather my face with a heavy moisturizer
it is definitely mattifying.
the best mattifying moisturizer i've ever tried!
use this as a moisturizer
when i applied this moisturizer on it's own
my holy grail moisturizer is clinique dramatically different gel
when i mix this with my clinique moisturizer
great ingredients with this moisturizer
i've replaced my morning moisturizer with this
i stay matte for most of my work day
this is still the best moisturizer i've used
i love the way my face feels after using the first aid mattifying gel
i've really been enjoying this moisturizer for my oily
i even use it as my moisturizer/primer on "normal" makeup days
i mix it with a clarins moisturizer before applying
i love this moisturizer!
it has allowed me to wear a slightly moisturizing day-time serum without feeling greasy
this moisturizer controls the oil very well
it also didnt make me breakout at all like some moisturizers do
this moisturizer is mattifying
mattifyinf which makes it great to combine with a sunscreen
sunscreen + moisturizer = gunky mess for me
it's been tricky finding a moisturizer that is free of alcohol
not only does this moisturizer make my skin feel soft
this moisturizer does not break me out
this moisturizer is perfect!
usually i have to add moisturizer a few times before my skin feels moisterized
let the moisturizer dry completely
even with using an oil-free moisturizer
sometimes when i use my moisturizer my skin will get a bit oily
i normally put it on after my moisturizer
i apply it after applying my moisturizer.
i found this while doing a sephora search for wrinkle cream
still a great night time moisturizer!
you can dab your favorite eye cream after
i've spent lots of money on creams for my eye area
figuring this was just another eye moisturizer
my eye bags are always dry from concealers i use for my dark circles
i've found the best moisturizer
i usually use belif's aqua bomb moisturizer
so this moisturizer is my go to
this is the best moisturizer i own!!
a great cream for dry skin, love it before bed.
i love this moisturizer!
this is the best moisturizer i've used in a while
even with matte formula
this moisturizer has really made a difference in my dry skin when i've used it faithfully
this moisturizer is literally the best i have ever tried
this moisturizer was great
this is by far the best moisturizer i've ever tried
no other moisturizer worked
not sure if this is curing my acne or if my old moisturizer was just breaking me out
i don't think i'll ever use another moisturizer again
i love this moisturizer
it's official, this is my holy grail moisturizer.
this moisturizer is so good.
this is the perfect moisturizer for me
must have moisturizer for dry skin.

now that i am approaching 50 gel moisturizers don't cut it
this is one of the best day creams i have found for my skin type
this moisturizer doesn't react with other products

s of moisturizer trying to improve the appearance of wrinkles

this moisturizer is exactly that
other strong moisturizers weren't doing the trick

once i run out of my other moisturizer

now in my 50s a good moisturizer is important
this moisturizer takes a little while to completely absorb

this moisturizer does not feel thick
i've ditched that product because this moisturizer is my holy grail
s down the best moisturizer i have ever used

this is my new holy grail winter moisturizer.
i am still on the lookout for the perfect moisturizer
my new daily lotion, for good!
feel like i've tried every moisturizer under the sun
am always reapplying moisturizer
since using this i have not had to reapply moisturizer once
is a really effective moisturizer
i would suggest using it as a nighttime moisturizer
i feel like it didn't soak up into my skin like my lush facial moisturizer does
it's safe to say this is my hg moisturizer
a great base prior to applying moisturizer
the aqua bomb moisturizer was eehh.
belif's moisturizer will for sure take care of that quickly enough
i do wish there was an exfoliating wash that i could use
on a whim i decided to try this cleanser since i loved their aqua bomb moisturizer
tight no moisturizer can really save it
always wear black mascara
use the belif moisturizer after!
makes me glow-y before i even apply moisturizer
found my hg moisturizer!
love the facial moisturizer as well.
surprisingly, my waterproof mascara as well!
applying this moisturizer is easy.
this moisturizer works very well for my skin
my combination/sensitive skin loves this moisturizer
i don't have to use any other moisturizer with this product
this moisturizer is perfect if you have sensitive oily skin
the moisturizer seems to be mainly water based
the last lotion that i used was from lancome
this moisturizer soaks right into your skin
this moisturizer is wonderful!

i've tried a ton of different moisturizers.
it's a nice medium to light moisturizer that sinks in quick
i really like this moisturizer!
this moisturizer is perfect for that
this is my favorite moisturizer for the hot weather
it does it's job as a moisturizer
this is by far the best moisturizer i've ever tried
this moisturizer is so light weight that you can't even feel it on your face
this moisturizer is all kinds of amazing
first off i am super picky about how my moisturizer feels
i love this cream
this moisturizer works great
other moisturizers leave my face feeling greasy
exchanged it for the aqua bomb moisturizer
this moisturizer fixed all the problems yet it feels so lightweight on the skin
this moisturizer is the best i've ever had.
literally like changing moisturizer!
i like a heavier cream for nighttime
this is my fav moisturizer because it works with my skin type that is dry
i am always on the hunt for a good moisturizer.

this moisturizer completely corrected my dry winter skin
i very much recommend this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is perfect for my combination skin
this cream helped my skin to balance.
giving me amazing feedback for this moisturizer/hydrator
i love that it is gel ❤️
many moisturizers on my way to this one
do to the fact that is a small moisturizer that last a long time
this moisturizer has h
once the gel / gel cream moisturizers started appearing i have been vigilant about researching
does have a "moisturizing bomb" which i have yet to try
best moisturizer i've ever used!
i recently switched to this moisturizer
this moisturizer has been amazing for my skin
this is the more lightweight belif moisturizer
i am glad this product does not contain sunscreen
my only wish is that it contained a sunscreen.
find sunscreen in another product
this is my favorite moisturizer so far.
with this moisturizer i feel like my skin finally gets what it needs
this moisturizer was the best i've ever used.
this is the only moisturizer i'm able to use in the morning in hot
i always had trouble with moisturizers being too heavy
going to use this as my summer moisturizer.
this is my holy grail moisturizer.
the best moisturizer i've ever tried!
this moisturizer has changed my life.
some reviews suggest the moisturizing bomb is a heavier
heavy duty moisturizer in comparison
while the formula feels heavier it doesn't moisturize as well as the aqua bomb
this moisturizer changed my life!
that truly moisturizers your face without feeling heavy on your skin
fabulous with this moisturizer by your side
when there's so many options for moisturizers out there
it doesn't feel like i'm putting lotion/moisturizer on my face
i love this moisturizer for my combination/acne prone skin
i love how it is a combination of lotion
i really love this moisturizer
i needed a new moisturizer after mine was discontinued
potentially the moisturizer bomb in winter
some moisturizers do that
cream moisturizers during the day because i feel like my skin can't breath
would break out easily with my past moisturizers
this is my holy grail moisturizer
love this gel moisturizer.
i love this moisturizer!
this is the best gel moisturizer.
i love how light weight this moisturizer is.
s down my favorite moisturizer
after awhile my face isn't oily like other moisturizers
this might be my new favorite moisturizer!
this is one of my absolute favorite moisturizers!
this moisturizer is amazing!
this is the first moisturizer i've ever used that i can apply once in the morning
this is a perfect moisturizer for both am and pm.
my skin loves this moisturizer
i used coconut oil for a moisturizer
my skin craves this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is life changing
this is the best moisturizer i've tried
i love this moisturizer.
seriously the best moisturizer for oily skin!
while most enjoy a thicker moisturizer on this medication

i'd been using fab's 5 in 1 moisturizer everyday
moisturizer have changed my skin
i love the texture of this moisturizer
this moisturizer makes me so happy!!!
i looooove this moisturizer!
im in love with this moisturizer but!!!
it just didn't hold up well without this primer moisturizer
i can't use any cream
whether my skin is dry from winter or oily from summer this moisturizer seems to perfect my skin
no other moisturizer works as well as this one does
the absolute holy grail moisturizer for my combo- dehydrated/oily
this is not like any other moisturizer.
this moisturizer is great.
honestly it's a great moisturizer for probably any skin type
it's between a gel and a cream, i guess.
bought this in place of my usual ole henriksen sheer transformation moisturizer
i switched back to my other moisturizer
i love this moisturizer so much!
moisturizers don't do anything noticeable for my face
have had to switch to gel moisturizer
i actually meant to purchase the moisturizing bomb
a similar reaction happened to me with the clinique moisturizer
i think the gel moisturizer just isn't for me!
gives me a glow without using any type of foundation or tinted moisturizer
this moisturizer doesn't do that
i absolutely love this moisturizer!!
have trouble finding a moisturizer that will give me moisture
i find that you can even layer on the moisturizer
this is my absolute favorite moisturizer ever!
this moisturizer is great for my skin
love this moisturizer for daily use.
i've got a lot of fancy pants moisturizers from my dermatologist
dry patches on my face that made using concealers
using this moisturizer after washing my face
that might be because i can now use a much lighter daytime moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer ever.
this is the greatest moisturizer.
best moisturizer i have used so far!
it's the best moisturizer for my combination skin
this is my favorite eye cream.
only bad thing is that it doesn't work too well under concealer
i love this eye cream.
i feel pampered with this cream.
try this eye cream
this is my new favourite eye cream!
firming eye cream now
this cream is amazing.
with this product my concealer
my concealer goes on perfectly
i love this eye cream.
this eye cream is amazing
the texture is more like a watered down lotion
the oil control moisturizer
replaced my evening moisturizer with it.
this is the only moisturizer that i use now.
i wore them both on top of my proactiv refining lotion
great daytime moisturizer for the dry months.
especially during my nighttime skincare routine
super cheap drugstore mascara that i absolutely love
the thing is waterproof
it gets rid of my mascara like a dream
bye bye mascara and lip tint.
this is a great eye cream.
works well under most concealers
eye creams are crazy expensive.
my concealer looks smooth on top
love this eye cream!!!
considering how expensive eye creams can get
some of the more expensive eye creams
the first eye cream
under eye concealer creasing situation
at 49, this eye cream does the trick.
if you've shopped around for eye creams
let's just say under eye concealer was my new pal
a really good eye cream
my concealer goes on completely smooth
looking at other eye creams
this is the perfect moisturizer.
not only does this moisturizer give me a lightweight glow
i love this moisturizer.
i am very picky with my moisturizers.
i love this moisturizer!
the pink lotion is for people who look better wearing gold
you get so much more product in the regular clinique moisturizer
this is just a moisturizer
i literally feel like im paying more for just glitter in this product compared to clinique gel moisturizer
i can feel the difference with this lightweight moisturizer
this would be a great moisturizer for the summer.
i think the glitter
i think i would consider this a really great summer moisturizer
i just bought this moisturizer in rosy glow
i would also suggest the nighttime version of this moisturizer
i usually use the clinique yellow moisturizer
clinique moisturizers are usually very hit or miss for my skin
i recommend this moisturizer to everyone who has facial dullness
this moisturizer has really put all that aside
this is a great moisturizer
don't like super-thick moisturizers or sunblock in my lotions
this is the perfect moisturizer for my skin.
i mix this with the yellow clinique moisturizer every night after toning as my final step
i would have to put on lotion after the shower
a couple of drops with my moisturizer
this works great to use before a concealer
i also love to mix half of one drop with my moisturizer at night when my skin is super dry
it is nice mixed with moisturizer in the evening to make a richer application
i mix it in with my evening moisturizer
i add a few drops to either my serum or my moisturizer
i added a couple of drops to my moisturizer every morning
i ran out of moisturizer
slathered it all over my face in place of a moisturizer
i can't wait to try it under moisturizer
added to my regular night moisturizer
works get with my eye cream
a couple of drops mixed in with your favorite moisturizer brings your skin back to life
this product has amplified my moisturizer
evening as moisturizer it's so gentle for the skin
i do ad just a touch to my eye cream for day wear
mixed with my regular moisturizer
follow quickly with your serum or moisturizer to avoid any dryness
this lightweight oil is perfect as moisturizer without feeling heavy/stuffy
i definitely need to moisturize after using it though
my undereye was so dry i could not use any concealer without it accentuating the dryness
i first thought it was my concealer that was the problem
trying under eye creams
i can use any under eye concealer
since i live in such a dry area i use a moisturizer on top as well
concealer will leave you looking dewy
my moisturizer alone could not h
i do know i have a beautiful glow when i massage a few drops into my face before moisturizing
i like mixing a few drops with my moisturizer
perfect as a base for makeup or your daily moisturizer
i take my night time moisturizer
i mixed it with my moisturizer before my primer
s with moisturizer all day
it's almost like a oil to cream formula
loved adding this to my moisturizers!
i could probably do with a bit of concealer
it takes the place of my moisturizer
this is a definitely more than i normally spend on a moisturizer
i love that it's a got a matte finish as so many moisturizers with spf leave my face shiny
i love this lotion!
this lotion works like a charm
with this lotion i don't have any of that
this is the only moisturizer i have ever used that prevents the terrible
almost every moisturizer/sunscreen combo i try makes me look just too oily an hour or two after i leave the house
i love this moisturizer.
it's my new favorite moisturizer
lightweight moisturizer/spf/primer combo for anyone
it does not moisturizer well enough for dry skin
is a very light moisturizer-perfect in the summer
this is now my go to day time moisturizer!
i love this moisturizer!
use as a tinted moisturizer
this moisturizer has been so amazing at keeping oil at bay
any sort of sunscreen product
therefore prefer to use a moisturizer with gently mattifying properties instead of 2 more layers
this moisturizer is the best for your face!
it is essential to find a good moisturizer which also has sunscreen in it
this moisturizer mattifies my skin
this cream does the job
a very strong sunscreen smell
i love to use this in the summer time as a moisturizer/primer
this is an excellent cream for oily
need sunscreen kind of day
because my skin tends to be sensitive to sunscreens
love the feeling of this moisturizer on my skin
i really like the blurring properties of this moisturizer
this moisturizer keeps my skin flawless for hours without touching up
doesn't smell like a sunscreen or feel heavy on my skin
i wear it under the algenist tinted moisturizer
it has instantly become my holy grail moisturizer
firming moisturizer in the evening
i know our moms taught us to trowel on the sunscreen
on top of my regular moisturizer
absolutely love this moisturizer for the everyday
this moisturizer has become my new favorite.
having sunscreen in my moisturizer is a must
warm the lotion it goes on perfectly fine
really great daytime spf moisturizer!
i also love that a little goes a long way with this moisturizer
always put a little jojoba oil or a regular moisturizer under it-wait for that to sink in
this sunscreen has a very light
i cannot fully blend the sunscreen in without rubbing
highly recommend because it's really great specially for a mineral sunscreen
i wanted a mineral sunscreen
this is a great moisturizer and sunblock.
my daughter needed a light sunblock for everyday.
i love the way this moisturizer makes my skin feel
i like that i can skip a moisturizer when using it
mineral sunscreen is almost impossible to find
i would have given this 5 stars if it was a little more moisturizing
i hate the way sunscreen smells
if it could be more moisturizing on its own
as someone who has used cerave cream for the past 5 years as a facial moisturizer i have come to be very picky about lotions
it works as both a sunscreen
love this sunscreen i work outside 24/7
good moisturizer but it is quite thick.
and it has sunscreen which is always a plus :)
i love this moisturizer/sunscreen!!
this moisturizer/sunscreen does just the opposite
this is my new go to daytime moisturizer!
've used many different sunscreens on my face that all ended up irritating my skin
if you try to apply it like regular moisturizer or foundation
i cannot recommend this enough for a daytime moisturizer
at night i use the ultra repair face moisturizer.
in order for this sunscreen to look
overall a pretty decent sunscreen.
i used this moisturizer in place of my regular first aid beauty ultra repair cream while on a sun filled mexico get away
weight as the normal ultra repair moisturizer
feels like normal moisturizer
does not have the typical spf/sunscreen smell
which is typical for most sunscreens
this is a moisturizer too
in the summer i plan to skip moisturizer
i've tried over a dozen sunscreens
doesn't have that typical heavy sunscreen feel.
make it a tinted moisturizer
this is my first time using moisturizer with spf plus i don't like the smell of sunscreen
i don't smell the sunscreen i really like it
i love this moisturizer!
i really like this sunscreen
moisturizer in one that works without feeling heavy
this is the first moisturizer/screen screen combo i've found that doesn't break me out
hard to rub in lotion
this moisturizer is not too thick it's not greasy
i tried this new sunscreen on a recent isl
i love my fab moisturizer
any other mineral sunscreen would leave me looking pasty
this is a light feeling moisturizer.
of all of lancome's moisturizers this is my favorite
absolutely in love with this moisturizer!
feels more like a gel rather than a cream
best moisturizer that i have tried
you definitely need to follow it up with moisturizer
my skin is so matte and oil-free.
put on lotion my skin was super smooth
just make sure you use a good moisturize after.
no matter how much concealer
this is definitely a must have for your skincare routine
always slather my face in lotion after using it to prevent my face from breaking out
i followed with the moisturizer
wearing sunscreen everyday can do a real number on your pores
don't have to put on sunscreen every day
i don't wear water proof mascara
moisturizer maybe 3 times a day if i need it
almost all of my mascara
it does take off regular mascara
my waterproof mascara takes some work with this cleanser
moisturizer i used the night before
holy guacamole this stuff makes your skin so soft is you use over another moisturizer
if you love the moisturizer version you'll love this
smells just like the moisturizer!!!
i do use the moisturizer with this as instructed.
in my moisturizer after i wax my face
makeup unlike the night a min moisturizer
always use it in combination with either a moisturizer or my fresh seaberry facial oil
i prefer the the texture of creams over oil
i recommend this along side the moisturizer
i layer another oil or creamy moisturizer over it
i definitely need to use another oil or moisturizer with it
i find with moisturizers they break me out superficially
i also wanted to switch up my moisturizer
star using something different from the night-a-mins moisturizer
night under my moisturizer
now i use this in lieu of a moisturizer
it comes out like a cream
it goes on like a cream
looks like a lotion when you pump it out
i didn't use any moisturizer after though.
before any of my serums or retinol, just gone.
this moisturizer makes my skin feel so smooth
i originally bought this because my new favorite moisturizer
really, really love this moisturizer!
when i moisturizer does what it claims do to for my skin
i will tell you that this is a very good moisturizer
add it to your favorite list of moisturizers.
often struggle with moisturizer because of this
this moisturizer is definitely my favorite!
i love this moisturizer.
this is probably the best daily moisturizer i have ever used
it's just a nice, basic moisturizer.
this will be my go-to winter moisturizer.
my skin seems to drink moisturizers like sand.
i love this moisturizer!
which now includes using this fantastic moisturizer
just added this product to my skincare routine
best moisturizer i've ever used.
this moisturizer leaves my skin softer than anything i've ever tried
this cream is now my favorite out of all his moisturizers
this moisturizer didn't both me at all!
so to find a moisturizer that doesn't break me out is amazing
this moisturizer works well for me in the summer
her eye creams are also amazing!!
other moisturizers just weren't doing the trick
it can be a day cream
i just bought this to go with the moisturizer
i've used the moisturizer for almost a year now
anyway so tonight after a glycolic treatment my skin was a glowy
no other cream or serum has done this
its a serum not a moisturizer
while it says it is a light cream
s down this is the best face moisturizer for combination skin
by far the best moisturizer i've ever used.
asked if they could recommend to me a good moisturizer for combination skin
this moisturizer really is great!
this moisturizer sinks in to your skin amazingly.
i just love the smoothness this moisturizer has provided
i consider it a medium weight moisturizer
it's a light cream i use at bedtime
this moisturizer gives my face the healthiest glow ever without being oily or sticky
no moisturizer has given me that feeling before
i love this cream
it's a great basic moisturizer if you've got combo-oily skin
i love this moisturizer
this is a great daily moisturizer.
this cream is light
this is the perfect day time moisturizer!
it's my new moisturizer!!!!
i see that it is a facial moisturizer?
i hate heavy creams
i love this cream because it is just a cream.
need just a simple moisturizer
my combo/oily skin really likes this cream
moisturizer or face oil
moisturizer because of how nicely it cleared up my face
moisturizer i would give 10 plus stars
i definitely needed to use a moisturizer afterward though
my moisturizers sunk right in
i also suggest putting on a moisturizer immediately after you rinse the mask off
this is the least expensive glycolic peel i've seen
it preps the skin for moisturizer.
i actually slather this on
she told me i needed a better moisturizer to help make my makeup look smoother
this is the most moisturizing thing i have ever put on my face
you can wear this as a moisturizer rather than mask as well
can be used as a moisturizer
this is almost the consistency of a thick moisturizer
i would use one of those kbeauty moisturizing sheet masks for like $1
i love clinique skincare products they will always be my favorite :
i recommend using a heavier moisturizer after this mask since it will dry out your skin even more
i recommend right after you pat dry your face to add your favorite moisturizer
with the addition to my moisturizer my face feels fantastic
never thought i would use an oil for daytime moisturizing
i layer this under my normal moisturizer to get rid of my annual winter scaliness
i looked for a very thick moisturizer/face oil
always wear a good sunscreen
like spreading a multivitamin on your face
a single drop of flora mixed with a lighter everyday moisturizer like renewed hope
my nars tinted moisturizer over it
i am hooked on oil moisturizers.
if you get regular facials like i do
and that's when i also layer my sunscreen on top.
in conclusion, this stuff rocks as a moisturizer.
i decided to use it as a layer moisturizer instead of a mask
which is a light moisturizer
it's too good not to use as a nightly moisturizer
also tried every moisturizer i had in my arsenal
read that it could also be used as a moisturizer when applied in a thin layer
usually moisturizing products just leave my face oily as all heck
i believe this might be a perfect moisturizer for us super oily girls
i used it as a moisturizer and left it on.
finally a nighttime moisturizer that does what it says
definitely a good buy for my skincare routine.
including my stubborn waterproof mascara
takes waterproof mascara off
then follow with my moisturizer
i followup with a moisturizer.
gets every bit of (waterproof) mascara off!
mascara has washed away
even the waterproof mascara without irritating my eyes
the balm removes most of my make up beside waterproof mascara
when i'm lazy i love just using this then going in with an eye cream>serum>moisturizer then bed
lotions to be able to look like i have balanced skin
it is probably my favorite part of my skincare routine
before my nighttime moisturizer
this balm is amazing
i kept trying many moisturizers
pairing with ole henriksen's advanced hydration lotion to really do the job
i've used every oil-free mattifying lotion
this lotion however, is amazing.
you definitely want to exfoliate beforehand.
layers well under moisturizer
i gave 4 stars because this is a good moisturizer more for combo to oily though im too dry
i follow this up with a lancome spf moisturizer
i do love this eye cream.
i love this eye cream.
therefore do not match up well with concealer
this eye cream is amazing!
my concealer goes on so well!
i think it's totally worth it for the ability to make your concealer not crease or flake
i could even apply concealer over it s few minutes later
s an awesome base before concealer
that build up of moisturizers
i love to get facials
clear dual action moisturizer
i am so happy with this new additional to my skincare routine
my two prescription creams
nothing my moisturizer couldn't fix
make sure you use a good moisturizer afterwards
i think i am going to keep it as a regular in my skincare kit
off my prescription cream
i am almost 100% sure they are not applying a moisturizer after cleansing
though i do recommend a light moisturizer if you have dry/combination skin
i've also noticed my skin is less oily throughout the day when using this product with the moisturizer
anyone with oily skin knows the danger of heavy moisturizers
this lotion helped me when heavy
moisturizers usually break me out horribly
i actually do my normal moisturizing routine then i dot on my foundation
it's the perfect moisturizer for my combo oily breakout prone skins type
usually lotions i would try would over moisturize
this lotion in gel was the best solution
finally a moisturizer that doesn't irritate my sensitive
it's exactly what i want in a moisturizer
i feel like this moisturizer is perfect!
" i used it first as a day lotion
this is the best moisturizer i've ever used.
this is the first moisturizer that i'm happy about
don't need any additional lotion
this lightweight moisturizer is a secret double agent of my skin ritual
great as a light weight moisturizer
i followed with a moisturizer then a powder foundation
let dry followed by moisturizer
i love the way this moisturizer makes my skin feel
moisturizers make my face sticky
this treatment oil does a great job in plumping your skin
use this under moisturizer day & night.
i wear it instead of a moisturizer in the summer
even after my moisturizer my face is still tacky
i don't immediately apply a moisturizer to my face except for immediately applying an eye serum only to my eyes
then i apply a very light oil free moisturizer
definitely a staple in my skin regimen
find it great if you have acne because the exfoliating beads are fine
you will need to follow up with moisturizer as it does feel fairly drying afterwards from the exfoliation
i do use a good moisturizer after use because i have really dry skin
perfect way to pamper myself.
you may not want to exfoliate with it if you prefer a super gentle exfoliator as the beads do feel powerful on the skin
i do find it a little drying so right after i use my korres rose brightening moisturizer
you do need to wear a sunscreen after using this product
follow with my moisturizer
i usually get the sheets with the serums or a creamy moisturize type mask
or if you've been using retinol cream
they are great at exfoliating the dry patches i used to get in winter
help my moisturizer absorb
i love that it has an exfoliating side
then my night moisturizer
i didn't know what to do to stop the dryness i used my normal moisturizers
i just started using this as my night moisturizer
then followed with my daily spf moisturizer
i only applied mascara
need to be careful with how thick my moisturizer is
i absolutely loved this moisturizer.
the moisturizer is lightweight
which has been a problem for me with some other higher-spf moisturizers
no brake outs which i get from some moisturizers with sunscreen
has an exfoliating feeling when you put it on
because i used to have the genzin moisturizer
only concealer over acne
i follow the mask with a serum and moisturizer.
if i want to exfoliate a little more
just make sure you follow up with your favorite serum or moisturizer
has to be the lotion
there are exfoliating beads in this so you are supposed to use your h
is ideal for a night out under makeup moisturizer
this is a light weight lotion feel which does absorb quickly
this moisturizer leaves my skin soft
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is great so far
the best moisturizer i have used so far.
this is a great everyday moisturizer for anyone with skin like mine
this is the only moisturizer that has helped clear my chin acne
this moisturizer is my favorite.
when my old moisturizer became difficult to find
im in love with this moisturizer
i tend to breakout when i use sunscreen
no more greasy, slippery, spf moisturizer.
this is a perfect day wear moisturizer with a combination of both moisturizer
i've had a really hard time finding an anti-aging lotion with sunscreen meant for oily skin
this is my go to moisturizer.
plus it has anti aging properties and sunscreen.
i really enjoy this moisturizer.
before using this moisturizer
the only moisturizer with spf that doesn't break me out
it's a little bit thicker than moisturizers that i usually use
yet not comedogenic spf lotion is one of the only ones my skin doesn't resist in the morning
i recently needed a new moisturizer with spf
this is perfect for a day moisturizer.
this moisturizer is light
because i really want this to be *the* moisturizer
i layered this over my usual night treatments
i even use it as moisturizer in the morning too
pearl one are ok they moisturize
did not even have to moisturize the next morning
hands down the best moisturizer i've ever used.
then moisturizer for eyes
i've used the shiseido pureness matifying moisturizer for previous summers
best and only lotion i will ever use!
this lotion is amazing
just a bit much for facial moisturizer
i like this moisturizer because i have oily/combination skin
a lot of moisturizers just add to the chaos
overall i'm fairly happy with this moisturizer.
i really love this moisturizer.
love how light this lotion feels.
this moisturizer leaves me softer
use this one after my moisturizer
tried a different approach with a moisturizer
although this is quite pricy for a moisturizer
this the absolute best moisturizer i have ever used
with this lotion i'm matte all day long
most moisturizer promise to be oil free
this is the best moisturizer i've use that actually works
i would say its definitely a daytime moisturizer.
even mascara on the first pass
even waterproof sunscreen which is the toughest one to removed gently
this is the only thing that 100% removes my waterproof mascara
including long wearing mascara formulas
all lipstick for that matter
even waterproof mascara at once
removes even waterproof mascara
even works on water proof mascara
even the stubborn mascara
took off all my makeup even waterproof mascara
i only use this on my eyes since i only wear waterproof liquid eyeliner
works great w concealer doesnt pill
for this eye cream
the best eye cream to use before concealer.
my concealer looks much better when i use this first
then my eye cream
this is the greatest moisturizer ever
i no longer have to conceal it with tons of concealer
the directions say to put this on before your regular moisturizer
i didn't even need moisturizer after
their serums have kept my skin looking youthful
this moisturizer is fabulous!
in the am, i use this before sunscreen.
this eye cream is lightweight
this moisturizer is great with sensitive skin
this moisturizer works great.
it's a thicker cream than a regular lotion
i tried so many different moisturizers to deal with my dry
this moisturizer has not let me down
i love to use it as a night cream
this is my go-to moisturizer.
love this cream for my skin in the winter!
overall i am pleased with this moisturizer
as it irritates my skin when in a moisturizer
this is probably the best moisturizer i have every used
needed an alternative moisturizer for my face that wouldn't burn
i absolutely love this product for the weeks i am off my prescription creams because it is very light weight on my the skin
it's not the greatest moisturizer i've used
i found my moisturizer that lasts all day.
i couldn't find a moisturizer that worked until i tried this
i simply love this moisturizer.
was delighted that it continued to moisturize my face much longer
one thing i really like is compared to other dry skin formulas of facial moisturizer
now i use this moisturizer in the am
i am really loving this moisturizer.
decided to try a different moisturizer that included spf
it was a moisturizer i used in my 20s religiously
i used this for my winter moisturizer.
this is my go to moisturizer in the evening time because its a bit too thick to wear under my makeup i think which is okay because i use the regular moisturizing lotion during the day
this moisturizer is everything!
this is a great, rich moisturizer.
i can definitely say this product is the best of best in the clinique lotion or cream
i found the dramatically different lotion
gel didn't work for me
i love this cream.
it's has all the things i love about the lotion formula just slightly thicker
i normally use the dramatically different lotion
i love this moisturizer!
haven't had any problems until the moisturizing lotion changed formula
for a year i started using other moisturizers
formula that clinique has made in a moisturizer
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used for my extremely dry
it is a perfect night cream
i've tried more eye creams
a couple nights a week i use the origins moisturizing sleep mask
used a heavy moisturizer during that time
i don't even need concealer!
use the cream afterwards.
directly on skin prior to moisturizer
moisturizer or just use it alone
i mix it in with my moisturizer before bedtime
99% of the time any concealer or foundation i put ends up defining dry patches flakiness
i typically put on my everyday moisturizer
i like using it by itself right before moisturizing in the morning
my undereyes always look chalky even with high end concealer
one drop of this with concealer
one drop for your lips before applying lipsticks ---> does amazing job
i mix one drop with my moisturizer
it's the best thing i have done with my skincare routine
mix a drop or two in my morning moisturizer
i mix in a few drops with my moisturizer at night
i mix it with my moisturizer
that even applying more moisturizer was not helping my flaky skin
i mix 2 drops with my daily moisturizer
i mix 1-2 drops with my primer or any face moisturizer
i like to mix 1-2 drops with my moisturizer before applying makeup
i also use it with my night time moisturizer
you can add it to any skincare of makeup product
i add it to my nighttime moisturizer
adding it to my moisturizer helps it spread more evenly
works with both dewy and matte formulas.
not the best moisturizer for my usually dry skin
this is the only moisturizer that makes my skin smooth
i love this moisturizer.
i also use the gel mask on top of the bouncy gel moisturizer
it just doesn't feel like my typica moisturizer that i'm used to
the transformation in my skin since starting to moisturize with this instead of a cream is unbelievable
i am in love with this moisturizer!
i can say that this moisturizer really helped my skin
along with a good daily moisturizer
this moisturizer is amazing for any skin type
i recommend this to anyone who needs a good moisturizer that is also great for sensitive skin
it is a great moisturizer to use year-round.
so like the skincare junkie i am
it was when i was using this moisturizer
this is my go to moisturizer
went to sephora for a refill of that product when i discovered this gel moisturizer
this gel based moisturizer works perfectly
i've never loved a facial moisturizer this much
the sephora i was at didn't carry the moisturizer i use
this moisturizer is truly spectacular!
works way better than any face lotion.
i love this moisturizer!
this moisturizer was perfect for me
the sephora expert went and got this lotion gel.
love the texture of this moisturizer!
this moisturizer makes skin look great
glad i did, this moisturizer is amazing.
either alone or mixed with a tinted moisturizer for color coverage
this is my holy grail of daytime moisturizers
i used korres pine antiaging sunscreen for a bit
this is my go-to daily moisturizer now.
i've tried other philosophy moisturizers
this is the first moisturizer that truly makes my skin look amazing
this cream is amazing
it doesn't weight my skin down like some face creams
the added spf is a bonus for my skin
finally a cream that says
i usually have a little sensitivity with sunscreens
this is my new go-to moisturizer
for an anti aging moisturizer
i always use good eye cream
this is one of my favorite summer moisturizers.
i almost purchased the black moisturizer that boscia has until i saw this sake one
the moisturizer is a bit tacky right after you put it on
this moisturizer it's great.
this moisturizer is perfect for oily/combo skin!
so you don't feel totally saturated in moisturizer
i also love that i can use it as a daytime moisturizer
i am convinced that this is the perfect everyday moisturizer for oily skin types
this moisturizer has made my skin smoother
i can use this during the day under moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer that made my face soft again
this face cream absolutely changed my skin
the moisturizer can be used as directed
this is the only moisturizer i have been using under my make up
this moisturizer is so balanced
had to use whatever moisturizer i had left
this sake balm is amazing
this is probably my favorite moisturizer
it's a jelly type moisturizer that goes on very smooth
in the summer i use it as a moisturizer
paying this much for a moisturizer was super uncommon for me
not as a day moisturizer
was asked to test this moisturizer out based on smell
i am even more satisfied with this moisturizer
don't get me wrong i like a thick hydrating moisturizer
this is a light weight moisturizer that is not oily
just finished my 3rd jar of this moisturizer
my only complaint is that this balm is not moisturizing enough on its own for my dry skin
i always layered another moisturizer on top.
best moisturizer i have ever used.
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
sensitive skin safe moisturizer i have used
i love this moisturizer.
it's usually really oily when i use moisturizer
this is absolutely the best moisturizer i have ever used
this is honestly the best moisturizer i've ever used on my face
this is a wonderful moisturizer
depending on what i'm feeling that day with my serums
this moisturizer works well for my combination skin
this is the first moisturizer that hasn't made me oily
this moisturizer has made all the difference in my skin
just about to repurchase this moisturizer!
i try something new every time i run out of moisturizer
highly recommend this moisturizer.
now it is my holy grail moisturizer for the day time
right before my sunscreen
this moisturizer is also an amazing base for makeup
i won't live without this moisturizer.
the cream is not same
this moisturizer is absolutely perfect for me
i do love the brightening properties of this gel
since i started using this moisturizer i have been getting tones of compliments on my skin
this moisturizer does really well for the price
just don't "slather" it one
the lady recommended a moisturizer
she put this moisturizer on my face
it's extremely moisturizer without being super heavy
love this night cream.
i used this on top of the oh invigorating night gel
my daytime moisturizer is nurture me
it's better than many other eye moisturizers i've tried
very light but effective moisturizer.
i wear a heavier moisturizing eye cream from another br
this cream is lightweight
give this eye cream a try
a good weight eye cream and easy to apply.
wears very well under my concealer
this is my new regular eye cream
it is a good eye cream.
it takes so much concealer to cover them
the woman at sephora told me this would have more hydrating effects so we went with the creme
s of dollars on eye creams
i didn't even wear concealer over this!
this is one of the best eye creams i have tried.
use the spf eye cream during the day
love this eye cream.
i love having this eye cream
it's thicker than other night creams i've used.
this is one of the best eye cream/balms i've ever used
this eye cream is easy to apply
i love this eye cream!
no cream is a miracle cream
this is the only eye balm that i trust .
i love this eye balm.
needs to be applied over moisturizer
which i used to use to minimize shininess from my moisturizer
just a cool gel like cream for the eyes!
i love this eye cream.
this is a nice basic eye cream
love this eye cream.
i do love this eye cream.
great moisture, concealer goes on more smoothly
this is just moisturizer that reduces normal dark circles
this is not the balm for you
l'occitane eye cream is what i needed.
i love this eye cream.
i like this cream
it's wonderful for day under concealer.
this eye cream is great!
this eye cream provides the right amount of moisturizer
i love this eye balm.

the best eye cream i have ever used!
i love this eye balm.
this light as a feather balm is my day-time eye cream
this is a great eye cream
this moisturizer is absolutely amazing
this is the best moisturizer i have used yet.
this moisturizer makes my skin so soft.
i really like thicker creams now that i'm into my forties
my very sensitive skin has not broken out using this moisturizer
more like a thick-ish lotion
prone to breakouts if i wear the same moisturizer 24/7
this moisturizer has been the best at remoisturizing my skin
i prefer the non-spf as i use precious cream as a daytime as well as a nighttime moisturizer
one layer of this cream does what it takes many layers of other creams to do
immortelle precious cream is going to be my "forever" moisturizer
i love this cream and the eye balm too.
i decided to try this moisturizer along with the face scrub
this moisturizer goes on so smooth
would be this cream
this is a great moisturizer.
l"occitane is the only moisturizer i will use.
this is an intensive moisturizer
this is one of the best moisturizers i have tried
i love this moisturizer
so finding a moisturizer that actually feels comfortable
this cream works so good on my dry skin.
truly the best daytime sunscreen/moisturizer i have used
l'occitane's immortelle precious cream moisturizer is one of those delicious luxuries that is definitely worth the price
i absolutely love this moisturizer.
i layer laura mercier tinted moisturizer over this for great coverage
i received a sample of this immortelle precious cream after purchasing a body lotion
this moisturizer seems heavy at first
night as my all the time moisturizer
even better than the "pricy" creams
have a hard time with strong creams like this
i suggest a moisturizer after if your like me
whenever i go overboard on moisturizing
it leaves a fair amount of eyeliner
the eyeliner was still in a perfect line
thought i'd give this one a try because it says it's moisturizing
once my moisturizer is on theres no more problem
if you moisturizer after use
i slathered on a heavy moisturizer before bed
i also applied my regular moisturizer after.
my current favorite is the pink moisturizing one
i don't really wear eyeshadow
a moisturizer afterwards takes care of that
i put this on over my moisturizer
this is a good serum to use for day under sunscreen
creams given my skin is normal-dry
then i apply the tatcha indigo soothing triple recovery moisturizer
then chosen moisturizer has made my face calm
the formula is quite a bit thicker than other serums i've tried
always on the lookout for a good wrinkle serum
this paired with the josie maran milk moisturizer is perfect for my skin in the winter
i usually have to exfoliate every other day to keep my skin smooth
from eye creams to the wonderful genius line
can't wait to show my facialist.
i sometimes forget to use moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer if you have normal/dry skin
this is a gel-like moisturizer.
very occasionally tho with my current skincare routine
i tried this moisturizer
this moisturizer is great!
this popped up as a moisturizing cream while i was searching for a new moisturizer on the sephora site
while it isn't that great of a moisturizer for me
i prefer to mix it with a tinted moisturizer for a little more umph in the moisture department
my favorite moisturizer ever.
i actually really liked this face lotion!
this moisturizer is the best moisturizer that has suited my skin
i love this moisturizer.
this is a great moisturizer.
this moisturizer has the best smell ever!
this is an anti aging moisturizer.
for best effect put this cream in the fridge
i love this eye cream cold
asked what concealer i use i said i have nothing on
also moisturizer that lasts
it is a good moisturizer for the eye area
this eye cream works very
i've also use the eye cream and night cream.
even a mild moisturizer makes them look greasy in couple of hours
i would definitely recommend putting it under a moisturizer
always apply moisturizer after
use a good moisturizer with it
moisturizer in the same line
i think this serum plus the ren calming moisturizer have helped a lot considering how i used to suffer
love this moisturizer it's light
one of the best moisturizers ive ever used.
the perfect everyday moisturizer.
the best moisturizer ever .
i got this moisturizer as a part of the method 3 steps regimen
i love this moisturizer!
this is by far the best moisturizer i've ever used
this cream is life changing
follow with lancer nourish moisturizer
applied before my moisturizer
i completely stopped using concealer under my eyes
this is a pricey eye cream
it is a great moisturizer
this eye cream is outst
it doesn't leave my skin feeling a bit tight like some gel moisturizers that dry out
i love this moisturizer!
it moisturizers the perfect amount
i swear by this moisturizer!
as soon as i started using this moisturizer my skin cleared up
this is my new favorite moisturizer.
definitely my hg for moisturizer.
this is my hg daytime moisturizer for life!
it sets in under 2 minutes than i apply moisturizer if needed
i am so in love with this gel cream!
this is my new forever and ever moisturizer.
this gel moisturizer is the best one i have ever found in my 31 years of life
the next best moisturizer i've found that works well for my skin type is clinique's dramatically different moisturizing gel
i always use sunscreen
this gel cream is the best thing that has happened to my sensitive skin
this is the best moisturizer i have found!
i think this will make a good spring/summer moisturizer under sunscreen
decided to ask for advice on face lotion
this is absolutely the best moisturizer i have ever used
as i would any other moisturizer
i really do like this moisturizer
most moisturizers either make me break out or don't moisturize enough
then i go ovet with this gel cream
i love this moisturizer.
this gel cream at night
so far i'm liking this moisturizer
this moisturizer has a r
i will try another moisturizer after this jar is done
i usually end up using moisturizer throughout the day
perfect moisturizer for dry sensitive skin feels amazing
i can get around this by layering a moisturizing bb cream or tinted moisturizer on top
this moisturizer is fabulous
when first looking at this cream/gel
as night time moisturizer
although i would definitely use moisturizer as well
like i didn't even have to put moisturizer on after
a started to use this as a nighttime moisturizer
i cannot use this product every night because it tends to over-moisturize my skin
this is my first ever moisturizer.
i love this cream
at first, this moisturizer was not my favorite.
i love this moisturizer under foundation.
it is just right as a moisturizer before my morning makeup routine
while i am completely obsessed with farmacy's "sleep tight" moisturizer
this moisturizer is awesome.
the moisturizer seems like it would be super thick based on the color/texture in the jar
searched for the perfect moisturizer
this lotion has a bit of an odd texture
it is the only moisturizer that actually absorbs into my skin
it's a game changer from my usual moisturizers.
my new favorite moisturizer!
the is a nice lotion.
i love it for a morning moisturizer before makeup
i found this moisturizer amazing
this is an amazing moisturizer day
this was a great base moisturizer with a consistency throughout the day
this really is a good moisturizer.
i already tried a bunch of moisturizers
most lightweight moisturizer i've ever used.
a lot of moisturizers make it worse especially under makeup
i picked this moisturizer up as a 100 point perk last month
i got a travel size of this moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
wears good under see my sunscreen
this moisturizer has been amazing
i add the cream
this moisturizer is amazing.
for it to work the wonders that it can you need to exfoliate
it's a must with this moisturizer.
for my daily routine i exfoliate with laura mercier's flawless skin face polish followed by this moisturizer
this moisturizer is amazing, and healthy/safe.
i love this moisturizer.
my estée lauder anti aging cream at night
test many skin moisturizer
this is a perfect lite weight moisturizer.
i wasn't sure if this "natural" moisturizer was going to work for me
i can wear it under makeup or under tinted moisturizer if it's particularly dry
i love this moisturizer.
makes a great base layer for the tinted moisturizer i use as foundation
have found few moisturizers that i can use for both
super effective, amazing moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used
i got a deluxe sample of the firming sleeping moisturizer
decided to give the day time moisturizer a try
same with the nighttime moisturizer.
ready for put my creams
not heavy moisturizer that also didn't make my face breakout
this moisturizer is amazing
end up reapplying moisturizer at some point throughout the day
i am super picky w my beauty products- especially moisturizer
this moisturizer is light- leaves my skin firm
it's the perfect companion for my retinol moisturizer
i mix it into my moisturizer to prep my skin before makeup
i like to use it as a serum right before my night cream
i feel i need something a little more moisturizing on my face
it's not so moisturizing that i don't need a moisturizer afterwards though
put on toner/moisturizer right after
now that i've tried this facial oil i will never go back to moisturizers
perfect as a summer moisturizer since it leaves my skin moisturized
you can also layer it under a moisturizer of sunscreen without feeling like your face is covered in products
i know skincare takes a long time to see results.
my skin needed more than my usual moisturizer
night with no other moisturizer
i also use their moonfruit treatment as my evening moisturizer
lately i either use it over top of a moisturizer for added hydration or simply alone
i mix 5-6 drops with my moisturizer both night
minus one for price and making my concealer slip.
i would recommend this for oily/combo skin
penetrates the skin much better than any moisturizer ever could
i started using facial oils as my daily moisturizer a little over a year ago
normally moisturizers/oils make me break out like crazy
i will never use regular moisturizer again.
when i use this oil during the day i use it as a moisturizer
i drop a few drops of this with my regular moisturizing cream
i don't wear foundation or any kind of concealer on my face
i add it to my sunscreen
moisturizer in the mornings
i decided to add an oil to my routine instead of changing my moisturizer
it moisturizers without the oily feeling i was dreading
seal it with a moisturizer
great on its own in the summer or blended with lotion in the winter for extra hydration
i used it today to replace my usual moisturizer
this is the moisturizer you want
t really does the job as a moisturizer for me
layering a few drops over my moisturizer before bed
decided to switch it to my daytime moisturizer
finish off with my sunscreen
i won't be going back to creams
i've used every conceivable moisturizer for my sensitive skin
i still adore my lamer lotions
barely a hint of tinted moisturizer needed
perfect way to pamper yourself.
i added this to my skincare routine
this hydrates my skin so much i don't even put on moisturizer after
i followed with my serum and moisturizer.
adding this to my skincare
i don't even have to use as much concealer as i used to
my concealer doesn't slip around
i would say this is a good eye cream for someone young beginning in skincare
natural eye cream i've found
when using in the day it sits smoothly under my concealer
i know skincare is an investment
which of course makes concealer
i really like this eye cream.
i think eye cream is one of the most important parts of a skin care regimen
also keeps my concealer from looking too dry
never really use eye creams
the thing i liked best about this cream was how moisturizing it was
i love this eye cream!
i love this eye cream!
it works great under concealer
i actually use it on my whole face as a moisturizer
not just an eye cream
i found my new favourite moisturizer
as i finally found an effective moisturizing eye cream that's not $100+
it is not a miracle cream
great eye cream especially under concealer.
this eye cream is amazing
this is my new eye cream.
concealer also stay put on this
before my moisturizer at night
love this eye cream.
it is also a great base for my concealer during the day
it's a great eye moisturizer
good price too compared to the rest of eye creams
i don't like heavy eye creams
it sits well under my concealer
i just wanted an eye cream for night time to help with wrinkles
crepe-paper-like texture that i noticed once i put on eyeshadow is gone
makes concealer go on smoother
i am using less foundation and concealer.
applied a sunscreen after the serum
i started adding this serum to the ceramidin lotion
then put on your normal moisturizer
have noticed all my time spent worshipping the sun without sunscreen
i do use a moisturizer
a night cream after because this is a serum
i feel that this serum really primes your skin for a moisturizer which i love
i still use a moisturizer after
in the morning before moisturizer
it is a great moisturizer
this moisturizer is so light-weight yet creamy
this moisturizer has also helped clear up my acne within the first week of using it
i highly suggest this moisturizer
decided to upgrade from my homemade moisturizer
be sure to use sunscreen with this product
it preps my skin nicely for makeup or moisturizer
you have to let it dry before applying moisturizer
after i apply this serum i let it dry before putting on my moisturizer that contains spf
then put moisturizer on
apply with moisturizer you can wear under your make up
sits well under my moisturizer
then quickly tap the serum in before moisturizer
i am now on my second bottle of this serum- with much much brighter skin
i wish i had tried this after exfoliation or microneedling to get maximum benefits
i apply it every morning before my moisturizer
you certainly can't smell it after applying moisturizer
because this product layers much better with moisturizer
i apply my moisturizer
i also started using a tatcha moisturizer at the same time
it is perfect under their moisturizer!
i find that i barely need moisturizer after this combination
which i layer under moisturizer
it feels like giving my skin a multivitamin at the start of the day
i will likely purchase the de sunscreen
mascara if i am feeling wild
only concealer to help cover spots
if i am particularly dry then i use the de whipped cream as a night moisturizer
i apply either a plain moisturizer
then top it with a spray sunscreen or use a lotion with sunscreen
great as a daily moisturizer.
if you tend to have dryer skin i would recommend this as a part of your daily routine before moisturizer
struggle to find the right moisturizer to use before i do my makeup
if i use a heavy moisturizer
they advertise this as a moisturizer/primer
'm not sure about the claim of it being a moisturizer/primer in one
i love this moisturizer!
this is a great moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
it is a light weight moisturizer
i tend to have to use a little more of it than i would a thicker moisturizer
i don't use this as a moisturizer
i put it on before my moisturizer
i got this moisturizer in my sephora play!
it's perfect under makeup for a daytime moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer
it is the first moisturizer that i've used that i can say works great for dry skin
i've learned what makes this moisturizer perfect
the key is not overusing it since it's a gel/moisturizer base
this moisturizer goes on very smooth
so this moisturizer works great for me
it doesn't moisturize as well as i hoped it would
really like this for my nighttime moisturizer
i love this moisturizer it's amazing !
i compare it closely to boscia's sake gel except erborian's moisturizer doesn't give you any sort of tingling sensation
this moisturizer is definitely good for sensitive skin
i apply moisturizer anyways
love the shaving cream texture.
it comes out of the bottle like a very nice shaving cream
it takes off my mascara
i received this in the too cool set with moisturizer
it does feel like shaving cream
prep your skin for whatever toner or moisturizer you use next
it not only has the consistency of shaving cream
the product comes out in a shaving cream like consistency
i love the shaving cream texture
it's worked great on tarte eyeliner
i love the shaving cream texture!
leave the heavy duty work to my serums
it felt exactly like thick shaving cream for men
feel like shaving cream
my new skin care regimen
moisturizer after using this
the foam is fun to massage around your face
it's like your applying a luxurious shaving cream to your face
i still followed up with a moisturizer afterwards
place nice with my existing moisturizer.
i also like that you can use this to moisturize your lips as well
full disclosure: i love caudalie moisturizers.
googling the best eye creams for my age group
i literally don't have to use concealer anymore for dark circles
s down it is one of the best eye serums i have ever tried
i spent months trying eye creams
the first time i used this i didn't pat it in so my concealer creased really bad
this cream is amazing.
i need less concealer
an eye cream that actually works!
every concealer i've ever used under my eyes has creased
my concealer looks flawless
after a day of wearing liquid lipstick
it feels like it could be a great lip primer under liquid lipsticks
this cream helps to immediately lift
for me, this is the best eye cream i've used.
it also does pill at all under the concealer i use
i love this eye cream.
it's lightweight almost gel texture gone on perfectly under my under eye concealer
this is the eye cream to get.
this is a good eye cream
this is a great eye cream.
additionally my under eye concealer has been looking better
during the day i use sunscreen
you have to moisturize like crazy though
now i dont know what to do with the concealer
a sunscreen this will work long term
you must always use sunscreen at all times
almost every morning with their sunscreen
i've worn sunscreen religiously since my youth
it works well with every day use under the murad daily moisturizer
i let the formula set before applying moisturizer
i can use a minimal coverage cc cream without concealer
that goes away after i add moisturizer
i can't speak to how hydrating it is as i put on moisturizer afterwards
i recommend this serum if your trying to lighten
concealer in such a short time
i tried a lot of skin lightening creams.
followed by the moisturizer
always follow up with sunscreen
she recommended me to update my skincare regimen
make sure you moisturize really well after using this
finish with sunscreen when exposing skin to uv
i knew i needed something that could exfoliate gently
people always advised me to exfoliate
as long as i'm keeping up with my moisturizer
i follow this with ole henriksen empower moisturizer or sheer transformation moisturizer
my skin feels primed for my serum or moisturizer to be that much more effective
i still recommend a moisturizer to follow to keep your skin supple
seeing that this is an exfoliator as well
i love this exfoliator so much!
definitely recommend following it with a good moisturizer--
i wanted to try an exfoliator to combat winter flakey skin
i usually use liquid eyeliner
it always takes my mascara right off
i don't use much makeup other than some concealer
or tinted moisturizer from caudalie
mascara without much of a struggle
nothing that your regular skin care regimen can't take care of
add my moisturizers for the day
along with the new erborian frappe moisturizer
when paired with the proper moisturizer to target your skin type
unless you don't wear a moisturizer of course which would be with every cleanser
this cleanser is fantastic for helping my skin stay matte
if used with a good moisturizer it's totally fine
the moisturizer does not leave a greasy feel
i recommend a moisturizer in the morning
you will need a good moisturizer because it's pretty drying
i do moisturize every night before bed
however it's nothing that my moisturizer can't h
outside with ridiculously thick sunscreen
it came with the moisturizers
i follow up with a heavier moisturizer to avoid dryness
nothing a good moisturizer can't fix
i did pair it with a moisturizer though
this is not botox
i apply a small amount to my entire face followed with a moisturizer
there is no problem with putting moisturizer
this balm is amazing
moisturizer makeup remover i love this product can't live without it
then follow up with serums, moisturizer and oils.
the pluses or extra goodies from this balm is that it does a light exfoliation
it removes my concealer
this stuff even takes off my waterproof liquid eyeliner
all my eyeshadow super easily
i don't generally wear makeup everyday so this balm is perfect for most evenings
i do still need to use bioderma to remove my mascara {not waterproof either
although i really only wear mascara
bronzer during the week
i also use their moisturizer with it.
this balm is the favorite part of my day
removes my waterproof better than sex mascara.
when i wore just a little eyeshadow
follow with night oil/moisturizer
it works so good with your dramatically different lotion on top
struggle with trying to not let my concealer crease
this cream is life changing
keeps my concealer in tact
especially a good daily moisturizer with spf
super important to wear spf daily
this moisturizer i got in my playbox.
this is the best moisturizer i have tried so far
this is one of the best moisturizers i've ever used for my combination skin
my concealer/foundation/ powder tends to build up in the creases more
i really like this moisturizer it doesn't leave a white residue
this is a great under makeup moisturizer.
'm currently out of face lotion
i still prefer a moisturizer with retinol
i am especially impressed that oily skin is included for such a good antiaging moisturizer
i love this moisturizer.
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used.
will never use any other moisturizer.
it's a really lovely moisturizer
i plan on continue using this moisturizer.
although this does contain a sunscreen
it won't remove my mascara.
i follow up with toner and moisturizer.
it removes even my waterproof mascara.
i will definitely make this a regular item in my skincare routine
i put on a light moisturizer and i'm good to go.
layers well under moisturizer and foundation.
my skin was so soft & moisturizer after.
i agree my moisturizer works better after using this product
go to bed without moisturizer
i mixed it with my moisturizer
i absolutely love skincare
i usually just use a face moisturizer before bed
i would treat this as a perfect moisturizer
this moisturizer is unbelievable the best
this overnight moisturizer sleep mask goes on very smoothly
you would never know it contains sunscreen.
