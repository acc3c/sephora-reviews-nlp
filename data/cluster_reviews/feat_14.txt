dry to combination in the winter

this was because my skin was really dry
no dryness at all
only greasy in 90 degree heat / humidity around my nose
skin--especially in the summer when your face tends to melt off
when i started using this moisturizer in the winter i had tightness
it seems perfect for this weather because my skin is now noticeably smoother
live in a humid area
before using this cream i had dry patches between my eyebrows
after one apply i stopped seeing dry areas!!!!!
everyone with dry skin knows the feeling
it did not make my face oily or dry my skin out
since i have dry skin it is definitely not enough for the midwestern winter
at night for extra moisture
on my dry days i use a more heavy duty moisturizer at night because i don't think this would cut it for dry skin
at first i thought this would be too thin fir my winter skin
have relatively normal skin that leans towards dry in the winter
even in this dry wisconsin winter weather
it's dry as can be
so finding a moisturizer that treated my dry skin without breaking me out proved to be very tricky
have dry combination skin
a lot of moisturizers are either too much in my oily spots or not enough for my dry patches
i will be repurchasing this for the summer when my skin is not so dry
doesn't really hold up to dry winter skin
it has done wonders for balancing my combination of oily skin with horrid dry patches
moisturizes during the cold winter months without making me break out
this doesn't moisturize enough on my dry skin days
i do need to top it off with marula/rosehip oil on the drier days
my face used to be so dry
especially during the winter
it was a nice relief in the drying winter weather
my skin is not extremely dry so maybe for drier
my skin is tricky in the winter.
not only is it dry as a desert
right next to the dry patches will pop out pimples
more on the dry side during this cold winter
this is cooling on the skin after i do some masks that get warm on my face
so for me, this has worked for my very dry skin.
so my skin is normal/dry will def be more on the dry side with winter coming
it's a little hard to spread over dry skin because it absorbs so quickly
i swear i've tried every foundation under the sun for my red cheeks that are slightly dry
the only thing i don't have is dry skin
in the winter i'm usually too pale to use it
regardless if there is heat during the summer or harsh cold wind during the winter
it even covered a mild sun burn.
emphasized a few dry patches on my face
my only issue is how dry this formula is.
tends to dry very quickly
this doesn't cling to dry patches or sink into fine lines
i can see where it might get "cakey" on dry skin
it makes my skin appear more dry
is always super dry as well
t keepshould dry spots moisturized
is not thick at all
the dry skin that comes with it
it didn't dry me up or enhance any dry patches

dry irritated skin around my mouth
everyone from oily to dry skin
cold day out on the ski hill
between bitter cold outdoors to super hot
dry indoors my skin is in a constant state of redness
usually after the peel my skin is so dry
it does the job when your'e having a dry face day
also dry around eye brow
it gives me enough moisture throughout the day

there are no more dry spots on my face.
love this for my normal to dry skin!
my skin dries out
i've noticed it's very hydrating for my dry skin during the winter
has sun protection too
if you don't have *really* dry skin
get the normal to dry version instead.
one use and the dry patches are gone.
it also helps to "hold down" the flakes so when i put makeup on over the dry patches
that product wasn't doing the trick for the patches of dry skin that would appear near my nose
if it's windy or snowy outside
the ny weather in winter dehydrates your skin greatly

after using this consistently my dry spots have gone away

this is plenty sufficient to keep my skin from drying out

this moisturizer is very buildable in the sense you can you use more on extra dry days without feeling heavy
more dry because of the cold weather
then cleaning my face with products i felt a little dry
when i got home my face was still soft even the usual dry spots on the side of my nose were in great shape
my skin is also very dry
i think my skin was just so dry that my oil production would increase
in my dryer areas it is amazing without making the more oily areas super saturated causing breakouts
hot as the day goes on

as a day cream on harsh winter days
it works great in winter time as the cream works as a barrier to lock the moister in
the dry area on my cheeks
i will say it is very thick so you have to warm it in your h
however for my very dry skin it has helped a lot
i used this 5 nights a week in the winter to soothe my dry winter skin
as the weather warmed
with continued use over the next few weeks it also hydrated my dry patches better than anything else
even the dry patches started to heal
it is a wonderful moisturizer for my excessively dry skin while also not being at all greasy
at night i like to replenish my skin with moisture without getting overly greasy
soft even in that gross dry airplane air that usually makes my skin feel super dry
tends to get dry patches all over my face
some of it super oily while some of it can get pretty dry
i doubt it would be sufficient during the dry winter months
my skin can be dry so this is very soothing
my skin shows combination behavior- sometimes dry

just rinse with warm water

next i wet my h
s with very hot water
use that moisture to sort of melt the balm over my face

also note that if you use this in a really hot climate
when i used this i lightly wet my face
it moisturizes my dry areas so my redness disappeared
apply on dry skin
all my dry patches are gone
i go to this when i have that sudden dry phase
i used it with warm water
it didn't horribly dry out my face or make my very sensitive skin break out
always stripped my face of its moisture

especially soothing my newly dry
i tried to replace it with the hot cleanser
i rinse the cloth and hang it dry after use.
i apply the balm on dry face
i apply it to my dry skin
i then rinse, and pat my face dry.

mascara like nobody's business leaving my skin feeling super clean with out dryness or tightness
bone dry in the winter
meaning no cold liquid going on my face
in the winter it is very dry

i went to cold cream
my skin on my face was very dry
softening to my dry irritated skin

especially in the winter time.

i live in a very dry climate
doesn't just evaporate into the parched air
b/c when my skin is at it's driest
my skin feels drier
this leaves my dry
at first it leaves my skin feeling kind of slippery
i think the silicones in this will be great to protect skin from the dry winter air
i love this mask because my combo skin is slightly on the dry side with the weather transitioning in to fall
there are never any dry patches
it great for my dry skin
use a thin layer or it will be too sticky to sleep in
great for dry skin.
because it feels damp on the face
very dry in some areas
now that the weather here is warming up
i usually put a thin layer before going to bed.

my skin is a bit dry
kind of dry around my chin area
my undereyes seem a little dry one i apply concealer
it kind of has a wet foam like texture
the problem i constant have with every other moisturizer i have tried is that my skin feels dry after 20 minutes
the consistency reminded me of an old cold cream
i started using this as a night cream because of how thick it is
might be the moisture plump
did not help my dry scaly patches
the low humidity of california giving my face the look of a weather-beaten cowgirl --
yes, but worth it if you have dry sensitive skin.
my skin is dry
my skin has always been dry esp in winter
my skin is somewhat combo/dry
no more dry patches
fine dry lines are diminished
i started using it just as the horribly dry
frigid winter was ending
i've had less issues with dry
dry patches on my face
my skin recently started to react to the cold weather
my skin is never dry anymore with this.
it was just what my dry flaky skin needed

i live in a dry climate
thought this would make my skin too dry
left it until it dried
it dries my skin out
tightened as it dried
this mask did not over dry my face or make it red
i would suggest using a moisturizer right after this mask as the peeling effect can leave your skin feeling a bit dry
to get a feel of how it will dry
this mask sucks all the excess oil out of my skin without drying the already dryer areas
the product takes a while to dry
my skin was glowing and did not feel dry.
i didn't find this to dry my skin like other reviewers said
t felt quite dry on my face
make sure to put a thin layer because if it's too thick it takes a long time to dry
some parts won't even dry so you can peel them off
i found it to dry my skin out badly
especially the ones that dry
didn't dry me out- which is particularly important during the winter
as the mask is drying you can feel it pulling your skin tight
it never gets dried out either
recommend to all skin types as mine is combination with mostly dry
the mask dried in about 20 minutes
dry skin flakes came with it which i loved
the whole mask didn't dry well

dry skin in some areas

without drying out my skin
this cleanser is gentle enough to not irritate or over-dry my skin
it's somewhat dry in the winter months
lots of cleansers meant for oily skin can leave my skin feeling dry
it dries out my skin like crazy
so my skin will be really dry in the winter
when the weather started to get warmer
it did feel a little drying once i patted my skin dry
i wouldn't recommend this for drier skin types or for the winter
it doesn't leave my skin parched
it doesn't dry me out either.
though it does leave my skin a little dry in some places after washing
it leaves a 'thoroughly clean' feeling without over drying
my skin dries up so bad
it can be used with a damp or dry face
i prefer dry as it gives a deeper clean
where it's extremely humid during the summer months
this mask however didn't dry me out
with dry patches on my cheeks
couldn't find a cleanser that left my face feeling really clean without drying it out
it really dried out my skin
so much so that i got dry patches all over my face
as in the humid summers my face was greasy in two hours
does not dry out my skin at all
it doesn't dry my skin
it caused my skin to become dehydrated

i don't think it works as well on brown sun spots
love that it comes with a dry then a wet nose strip
didn't leave his nose dry after the application
i think the key is to really soak your nose with wet
hot water to help open your pores
cool off the skin
didn't irritate or dry out my skin
it was not pleasant taking the dry strip off
the dry strip gripped really hard
i also like the cooling sheet mask for the nose after the dry patch
pulling off the dry patch is a little intense
they just dry my nose
after the dry strip it was so nice
cooling to put on the wet strip which hydrated my nose leaving it feeling soft
works great the dry strip really gets a lot out of my pores
judging by the dry strip
most of the time pull off whole chunks of dry skin around my nose
the wet patch was soothing on my skin after the dry one
especially the day cream under makeup
so my guess is the warmer temperature maybe makes it "melt" into the eye a bit
the mask isn't drying at all
after the thin layer of mask is totally dry i use small amounts of water on my h
the instructions say after it dries
