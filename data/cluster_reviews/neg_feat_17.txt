only using at night
i applied it around 10:00pm
can't really be used morning or night.
woke up to my normal skin.
not terrible as a night cream
thankfully i applied it at night
tried again after a day at the beach
i used it as a night cream
i tried it during day is was horrible every dirt
after an hour it still didn't soak in
my skin is so thirsty hours after application
could not manage to wear this during the daytime
it is fine for the nighttime
i tried this for at least week, every night.
looked at my skin in the morning
for the hours of the day after you've put it on
today i tried it
sure my face felt tighter for about 12 hours
which alone cut it out of my morning routine
when i put this on for the first week
spend a lot of time in the sun because of my job
am 27 so just starting to age
through out the day
giving this a 3 star rating because i use it as a moisturizing base before i apply my make up in the morning
the sample really gave me fresh eye look in the mornings
i am at the end of the tube
mid-way through the day
i put this on as my day eye cream.
making a second trip to return this product
on to the next thing.
i noticed that if i put this on at night
does little for the dark circles that come with late nights with a little one
my sleep is all over the place
thought the day cream would be fitting
when i use this i have to use 4-5 blotting paper throughout the day
so with summer here
now i am in search of a new summertime
disappointed with my new tube of murad perfecting night cream
i noticed after using the night cream for a week or so
i put this on at night
once using the product at home
after using this at night i wake to my crows feet being very deep in the morning
more tired than when i went to bed
the next day i had breakouts in the area where the under-eye pads were placed
it doesn't even last my full work day
change your pillow cases every couple of days
grab a sample to try out for at least a week before you part with your money
behold this is the side i used to sleep on
switch the side of your face you are sleeping on every few months
i used this for a month for my my smile lines for which i am superconscious about
i am in my early 50's
am returning the product
waking up in the morning my skin felt 10x more dry
i put it on before i went to bed
when i woke up
the morning after night 1 my skin was supple
i did the algenist 10-day challenge
i woke up the next day with red
i woke up on the 4th morning with breakouts all over my face
i am returning it soon
at first i used this product with my clarasonic
i'll go back to that next fall/winter.
i got this cleanser after it was used on me at the store before a makeover
when i applied the patches weekly
after 5 minutes i washed it off
when winter comes in new engl
i enjoyed wearing this at night
i used this morning
evening for about a month
i would wake up with new zits literally every day
great for daytime wear
i will be returning this to my local sephora tomorrow
plus i use my clarisonic every night with rose water toner afterwards
it's drying so only use maybe 3 times a week in the morning
especially in the am
i keep it in my shower
i used it every morning in the shower.
five minutes on my face and i had to wash it off.
the next morning after using once
the whole time i'd wake up with new
even after 8 hours of wear it was still tacky to the touch
on days when i do where sheer foundation
saw instant results the next day
i am nearing the end of the container
i noticed it gave my skin a nice glow just a few nights after using
for something i could use at night
for the first 5 min you have it on
i applied it all over my face in the morning
by the evening i had little bumps all over my face
there was a new breakout each day
with the change in temps on the east coast
after applying the oil to my skin last night
checking the next morning my skin is just as dry
by the third day
after i apply it
the cooling effect lasts for about a minute
i woke up the next day to a face full of clogged pores
i am still trying to clear my skin 7 days later
it does depuff my eyes when i use this in the morning
avoid drinking water 1 hour before bed
well i do sleep almost 11 hours a night
every 2 hours if you're out in the sun for that long
nose during the day
as soon as i put it on in the morning
by the end of the day before i wash my face
heavy by mid-day that i have to wash my face at work
f i applied it in the morning
morning after my normal face washing routine
especially when i woke up in the morning my face was greasy
i preferred to use a night cream with heavier hitting ingredients at night
i didnt like this at first
i first used this when i received my 30 day kit from the first moment i used it i experienced a burning sensation
every time i used it
i will use until it runs out
it will probably be good to have to clean face after no makeup days or after workouts
even in the shower
i used it for 9 days morning
uncomfortable throughout the day
dry throughout the day
so i gave it about a half hour to set.
this was a full on burn for the first 15 minutes it was on
put on my night cream
leave it on overnight
i couldn't leave on face for more than about 10 minutes
applying once almost every night before bed
i received a free sample that i used three nights in a row before bed
i wouldn't wear this one in the day time
in the morning my skin looked good
every night i use this
i break out more the following day
i put this on at night
even if i put it on before bed
hydrating first thing in the morning or before bed
i like to use it in the morning only if i am going to wear make up that day
i used it for two nights
my forehead is dry again after an hour
watering eyes for 30 minutes afterwards
my skin is in its late 40's
when i woke in the morning
it happened every time
started using it during a hot summer in the south
makes me look dewy before i even get out of the door in the morning
will keep trying day vs
i will continue to use at night
i left them on for 20 minutes
when the time was up
refreshing on your face in the morning
didn't stay on at first
i used it every time after washing my face
use it as a wake me up eye mask in the morning while i have my coffee before my shower
i will be returning this eye cream
taking at least a half hour to sink in
i put this on before bed
i used the whole bottle morning
i used it at night one time
i used it again the next night
in any event i returned.
i applied it twice before i went to bed
when i woke up the next morning my skin felt dry
i used it religiously every night for about a week
i woke up in the morning
just makes it worse especially in the morning
by the next afternoon i had 5 little white pimples all around my face
same results every time.
i left it on overnight
thought i'd try this out when getting ready for a saturday brunch
in fact, i wore it on a very humid summer day.
the next day i used it on the areas i want to glow
" when i'm on the go
while i'm asleep at night?
was nice to use at night to seal in all my heavier night products
this fell short for daily use under makeup
it felt dry after 2 or 3 hours afterwards
it leaves me oily after about 5 hours.
i applied this before makeup one morning
at the end of the day
even with just use at night
i felt excited to wash it off of my face in the morning
i would only recommend using this before going to bed
i woke up the next morning
maybe a few times a week at night or in cold/dry weather would work better
i tried this one night
then again the following morning
i put it on in the morning
within in an hour my skin was so ridiculously dry
when i woke up the next day
stays tacky throughout the day
i used it at night
it's my 3rd week using it
i live in a hot weather area
the old formula was cool going on like that feeling of swimming in a pool on a hot summer day
it goes on my face well in the shower
i used this at night
i used this morning
night for a month or so
night on my face
i wash my face at night
s after using it every day
only in the morning
i used it every morning
when i used it sometimes at night without a moisturizer on top
it made my face dry by morning
strong enough so that even when i woke up the next day i could still smell it
first day i used it
s or in the shower
even putting it on first thing in the morning
wouldn't use it as a treatment over night
stays on all day
it felt like it took an hour to absorb.
i am almost out of it
this was the only new item in my routine
my skin feels slightly tight at times after i use it during the day
i awoke with an oily t-zone.
which is good on a hot day
i put it in on in the morning
after only an hour was already fighting off a migraine
i applied it in the morning
i could smell it throughout my entire 10 hour shift at work
try it out for a week or so before deciding on purchasing
i used it at night after putting on top of sunday riley u
a day cream for summer
it turns out to be very sticky about an hour after i apply it
i am going to try the multi-active day without the spf
after i used it on a daily basis
when i'd wake up in the morning i'd have texture
i know it caused my skin to have a few extra whiteheads when i woke up after using it the evening beforeh
i brought it home yesterday
with a mist before i'm ready to put on something heavier for overnight
i applied it on my face before going to bed
humid summer weather starting about now etc
i would use this every other night
now i use this product almost every single night
i used this product nightly for a month for puffy area
i just use it at night.
at night i noticed in the morning when i put it on before i apply my makeup that when i go to apply my foundation it goes on evenly
of course i live 2 hours from the nearest sephora
i started off using just during the day
after adding it to my night routine
when wearing it alone
i tried it a few times at bedtime
it wasn't pleasant waking from my sleep overnight
tight in the morning
i did not try the product again because there were dry patches on my face the next morning
i took this on vacation
i've used other sleeping packs before
dry in the mornings
i like to use it as i'm waking up or during the day as a re-fresher because it helps awaken my eyes a bit
it does leave your face soft in the morning
brighten my bags due to sleepless nights
how it looks in the morning
i only use it before the gym now
if i wear it at night
waited for this to arrive back in stock.
my skin felt dry the next morning
i used this after a shower
i used this product 3-4 times in the shower
i only use it at night
cannot wait to wash my face in the morning
my makeup didn't even stay for 1hour
it did help with my makeup staying on all day
finding that i am having bad makeup days
nose were shiny by noon or before
by the first hour after makeup application
i only use this as a nighttime sleeping mask
leave it in my shower
used throughout the day
i did my usual morning routine adding this after my water based moisturizer
i happened to go into the restroom about 2 hours later
back to sephora it went the next day.
an hour later i looked in the mirror
the day i wore it
i am usually oily before i even leave the house in the morning
i did my make up this morning
by noon, i was my usual shiny self.
just tried this today
then throughout the day i was outside
i returned it to sephora the next day.
it looks like it works for the first hour
if i am going out with the girls one night i might use it
i swear every morning i woke up after using this over night you could see my two fine lines more than i did before i went to bed
it also failed to absorb quickly enough in the mornings
i used it overnight
after one month of morning
night every day for over 30 days
when i would use this in the morning or fresh out of the shower it felt awful
first day or two i absolutely loved it until like day 3 of using it when i started breaking out
i applied in the evening after the night serum
try it again in winter
used it this evening after i washed my face
but after a hour my skin is back to dry.
not 2 hours later i had enough oil on my face to fry chicken
by the end of the day my skin was dry
the 5 nights i used it
i didn't notice any benefits that next morning
so on days where i need a glow
it also wore off after a few hours then i felt dry
my skin felthydrated all day.
i wore this in the daytime and at night.
for about 5 minutes until you go out in the sunlight
it's a winner for evening looks
it's a never ending journey trying to find a product that can keep my skin in check during the muggy summer months
shower after every use
during the summer of the canadian north
i still like it alone though on days when i skip foundation/makeup
i just didn't think it kept my make up in as 'good' condition throughout the day
by the end of the workday
i put it on today
in the morning i wipe my face off.
their face mist to freshen up throughout the day or at the gym
i am still as unimpressed as i was on day one
it was during last days of october when it starts getting cold
it was fine until the morning after
the weekend that i tried this out was an oddly dry skin moment for me
i kept smelling it even 6 hours after initial application
i am having to wash it off 10 minutes later
though i did break out a little the next day
after my first time trying this product at night i woke up with 4 pimples
two together until using this cream morning
i will use it at night as a neck cream
i couldn't wait to wash it off when i woke up.
tried it as a night cream
the first day of wear
i don't have time to wait 30-40 min every morning before applying my makeup
ing outside in a complete rain storm
after waiting 15 minutes every morning waiting for it to dry it still doesnt
i am starting to break out
even half an hour later the stickiness still sits on my face
an oily t-zone are my best friends at all times in the summer
it wasn't until after i used setting powder that i didn't look like i had been sweating for an hour at the gym
was a complete oil slick by the end of the workday
wet for over 20 minutes
once i added this to my routine
every time i used it i would break out the next day
i keep it in the shower.
i used this after a workout
unless you have 30 minutes to devote to just removing the mask
returning it first thing tomorrow
it was just too much for the winter months in northern maine
after reading up on this
my advice is to use it as a cleanser in a morning rutine when you wake up
for every day use
the first day it felt fine
i work night shift
take care of a newborn during the day
i like the feeling when using it as a night cream
neck cream for about a month
i apply after i shower
i even tried to only use it only at night
only at the moment you put it on
try it again in the morning
in the morning, i was disappointed again.
heavy only after 20 minutes of wearing it
i live in cold
after one hour it was really bad
just took too long for a product i wanted to use for morning
want a moisturizer that can be followed by primer+foundation within 5 minutes
will be returning tomorrow
i used this in the moring for light moisture.
by the end of the day
still on the day after using it
have been applying at night
get about 9 hours before my current routine begins to breakdown
i got this in my box this month
it doesn't look gross when i wake up in the morning
it's 2 hours after i put this on
i used it two nights in a row in place of my regular night moisturizer
took a nap for a couple hours
especially during summertime so when i received this in my august play
my face was still greasy a little later in the day
kept me oil free for 8-12 hours
i ended up returning this the next day.
i still get oily around my t-zone except my chin after about 2 hours
i only got about one hour of matte out of it.
shortly after application i noticed that my skin felt very dry
very dry at the same time
oily after just 1 hour.
i only use it at night even though it should be use twice a day in the morning
i would have to wash my face at least 3 times from wearing a light summer foundation
it worked well overnight.
to leave it on my face for more than a minute
didn't add it to my makeup routine instead after cleansing at night i applied every night while the product does last long
it sat on my skin for hours
smooth in the morning
when i wake up with sleeping with it on my face
i've used it every day
about 2 hours later i went to the restroom at work
i am still breaking out at the same rate
because i used it at night
a day later i was peeling in those areas.
i got it during the vib rouge event before christmas
the next day i woke up
by the end of the work day
i used it in the morning
says to leave on for 25 min or until dry.
took an hour to dry!
i used it for two and 1/2 days morning and night.
twice a day as the lady at sephora recommended
wash my face two times a day
late this summer i started getting r
the directions say to massage for two minutes which i did thinking the burning would subside
the directions also advise to leave the mask on for 10 -15 minutes
make it a little bit soft for a couple hrs after using it
tried to pair it with the firming night balm after each use
i tried this last saturday night while i was having a lazy night in
i woke up looking like i’d left my face in the sun all day
i figured it would fade after an hour or so
even on to the next
wait an entire day before applying this to your face
i used it in the shower
i would be walking around an hour after applying this to my face thinking that the dog had an accident in the house
each time i watch my face
leave the dot on all night
i'll continue using it till i finish it
t's like early winter now
more like a sylicone base after the hour you spend trying to take the mask off
when she did a test on my h
the next morning i eve had a spot or two
i tried it again today
tried it last night
gave it a try tonight
i let it sit for about 5 minutes.
i tried it this morning
used 3 drops each time in the morning
if u use this, put this on asap after opening!
the smell lingered on my skin for hours.
had to wash it off within one hour
i will finish it
i used it morning
to put my theory to the test the fourth day i didn't use this cleanser
just from washing my face twice a day
an hour after putting it on my face felt tight
as of right now in the frigid winter months its not enough
i used the cream just for a day
after about 15 minutes my face felt dry
used it to layer in the mornings for over a month
especially in the mornings when i wake up after wearing it alone for a night
i put this on before going to work
had a bad break out the next morning
woke up the following day with a severe break out
noticed that my face was itch during the day
same results every time
started using it morning
i went thru the 7 day challenge
i prefer to use this only at night
because who has time to sleep?
which i am returning
by mid-morning my under eyes feel dry
and i will only use it at night.
i would recommend this as a daytime cream instead
it gave me several new whiteheads every morning.
i used this at night
greasy for the day time
it was recommded to my at sephora
by the end of the day i was dry again
that i get during the fall
i used the product nightly for a month
when using this cream at night
at this point in my life
be set for the day
also after about 1 hour i look like an oil slick with this
by midday it is even oilier.
at the end of the day i washed my face like usual with the oil first then purity
in the morning i woke up
after following the directions
got this in a set over the holidays
i am in my late 20s
decided to switch over to nighttime use
i put it on lastnight before bed
i'd only wear it at night because of that
i only used it one night.
when i woke up in the morning
it stayed dewey all day
i did my daily routine
i could only use this for two nights because the smell was making me nauseas i ended up returning it
i only used the cream at night
30 minutes after washing it off
my day-to-day make up is really light
i picked this up on a whim after hearing all great thing on this br
at the end of the day
i went on a first date after putting this on
i can't imagine going to sleep/ waking up like this every day
i am back on the hunt for something to help my dry
tried it again tonight
i used this for about a week day and night.
i can seriously put this stuff on at 11 pm
wake up at 8am
i took the travel size with me on vacation
made me breakout the next day
the next morning i had a couple of breakouts
the morning after i used the bar i noticed a small breakout on my forehead
immediately began using this twice a day as part of my skin care regimen
i love belif cushion which i use every day
on the third day i went to put it on
my skin is on the dry side that i received this sample with my purchase that i tried it on the next day
it gave me a headache after a few minutes of applying this on i just couldn't st
i slather a fine size amount all over my face as soon as i come home in the evening
let it hang out until i wash my face a few hours later
i may spring for another 100 point perk to get me through the rest of winter
almost sticky mid way through the day
i tried it for the first time this morning
om sparkles on my face for the next two days
when i put in on one morning in poor lighting i liked how it looked s
luckily tried it out in the evening after i was home for the night
then, i went about my usually makeup routine.
then go out in daylight
my makeup wore awful after about 3 hours
i tried it on my face the following morning
when i swatched it was not on my face at all
not before/after the gym as described
at first i did
i scrubbed last night
when i wake up in the morning after putting it on at night the skin around my eyes looks smooth
it seems to work better over night than wearing during the day
the evening the effects seem to wear off
i used it only at nighttime
it is a great addition to my nighttime routine
i actually used it as an overnight mask
used this am and pm.
it's great before bed
i tried it in the morning
the evening to see which worked better
the rest on my neck daily
my face is dry in the morning after using
it feels ok in the morning
i am on my late 20's
when i used it at night
did not use a second night.
about 5 minutes later i had to wash it off.
even if i leave it to absorb for up to an hour
i used this product once in evening
in the morning my face was clear
the next night my face cleared up
i put it on the first day
put it less on the next day
'll be using it on 'no makeup' days or at night time
feel drier after throughout the day
when i woke up in the morning
i returned it the next day
i used it before bed
i just followed with my usual night time routine.
little greasy in the morning
used it on my red face after a long day in the sun
i decided to try it last night.
i applied the mask last night about an hour or so before bed
can smell it hours after i put it on
repeat again another day.
i actually just had a very enjoyable relaxing long rested weekend
om spot on my face about every other day
the flakes return in 20 minutes
mostly just at night
i tried this product at night after washing my face
i decided against my usual patch test routine
i came upon this on the website "byrdie"
i will only be using on beach/pool days for the extra sun protection
i tried using it only at night
as well as trying it at night
would be an overnight detox
oily in the mornings
to carry with me to get rid of that mid-afternoon shine
chin a couple hour after applying makeup
i tried using it throughout the day
every time i used it throughout the day
do about 4 masks a week
i couldn't even keep it on for 5 minutes
which makes it great for a sunny day on the beach or at the pool
left it on for 20 minutes
make it part of my routine
just used this tonight
used it only in the morning
i just returned this product today.
use it at night
only every time i used it it would break my out the next morning i'd wake up with 1 or 2 new blemishes
i debate throwing it out every day
where the summer is hot
i wasn't mad at this until i had tiny bumps in the morning
have the luxury of applying good skin care even in the afternoon
great for night time use
but the next morning....it just dries up.
while the duo works wonders at overnight
when i put this in the morning, it breaks me out.
i started to notice my skin was at its best when i wake up then break out in the afternoon
can use this every night
when i woke up the next morning the skin looked bright
i switched to using it only at nighttime
washed it off within an hour
used it every day
night for about a week
it did an awesome job at separating my foundation though after four hours of wear time
i tried keeping it to night time wear
the next morning my skin looked flat
instead i wear it during the day
the first time i used it at home
after a few hours i began developing dry patches in the t-zone area of my face
cheeks after just 4 nights use
i used an oil from the ordinary at night
used it on two nights after my cleansing
sometimes i put it on as part of my am routine as well
this kept my make up looking matte for about 4 hours
hard to get off even next morning if you plan only on using it at night
i applied it at night before bed
it was still oily in the morning when i woke up
this was after 4+weeks of pm usage
i'd leave it to fully absorb for 3 hours
i used it overnight
i used it morning
this has quickly become my new go to cleanser in the mornings especially when i really need a invigorating wake up call
i used it for a week straight only in the mornings
i will update later
i am blotting within 2 hours of application
then throughout the remainder of the day
need to powder once during the day
once my oil production began 3-4 hours later this felt heavy on my skin
2 hours later my skin is an oil slick again
i always felt shiny by the afternoon
i may move to only using this after my nighttime routine when i don't have to worry about a bit of afternoon shine
however my face was still oily at the end of the day
for me i still needed to blot throughout the day
used it every other night over a two week period to wake up my tired looking skin
i think it would be a great eye cream for someone in their late teens early 20s
after a week of consistent use in the am
well then it's not that bad for a couple of hours wear time
had to wash off after 20 minutes.
i used it at night
or maybe in the winter
i used it every night before bed
to add both to my morning
even when i only applied it at night.
decide to use at night
i will be returning tomorrow.
my makeup didn't last all day
this is going back to the store today.
my face not looking greasy for a couple of hours
i can literally still smell it on my face 7 hours later
felt this sticky feeling on my face even after a couple of hours
i used it religiously morning
i truly miss the discontinued day
this was perfect to use in the morning under makeup
after an hour or
would be great for winter or nighttime
i tried it again this morning
trying this after two days i noticed all of my makeup was off halfway through the day
my face was shiny in 3 hours.
every time i use it i break out!
it still felt sticky the next day.
i ordered this with expedited shipping last thursday
rescheduled 4 maybe 5 times as the product sits in a warehouse somewhere
i woke up the next morning
place on my face
i left it on for the allotted time
the next morning it wasn't soft
i did get a few compliments on my skin the next day
when i woke up in the morning i had a greasy film covering my face
to begin with i was running late to work
not at same time
after the first night of use
i used it again the second night
i recommend instead the power couple by sunday riley it seems to be renewing my skin all around
just in the area where i put this cream
7 days in i started to notice a bit drying
i looked in the mirror mid day today
itself that is breaking me out because i use this as a morning cleanser
every time i used this i would wake up in the morning with small white heads that would turn into breakouts
picked this up during a vib event
they were in every conceivable place in my bathroom
appearance after each use
i brokeout bad the next day.
it only lasted on my face for 2 minutes before i had to wash it off because of the smell
i need something more industrial for evening
i did my regular nightly ritual
during the night i got up
i've used sleeping masks before
aside from that i slept with the mask on my face for two night on top of my advanced skincare routine
i actually felt more dry by morning than usual.
i noticed when i use this as a sleep mask
or as a 10 minute mask
i returned this to sephora the other day
nights as my first step
resumed my usual routine
didn't notice until i got home
either way i am 100% returning
i used it morning
only use it at night
i used one bottle in a month even though i used it only at night
this morning was my first time using it
i waited 20 min before going to bed
every time i have used this product i have broken out the next morning
did not last through the night
even after allowing a good half hour for it to sink in
soft at the same time
like i spent the whole night sweating
night since it arrived
by the next morning acne flared up as if i was a teenager again
no itching or burning during application or after at least
i will continue to use this mask 3 nights a week
at this moment while i'm writing this review
after about 5 minutes i had to wash it off.
i plan on using it on days i'll be spending a lot of time outdoors
inreceived this as a 7 day trial through influenster
i used the product every night for 7 days
i used it nightly for 7 days.
the product says that you can add this to your routin in the morning or the evening
i opted for the morning.
as the description had indicated it could be used in the morning before your normal beauty routine
i decided to try in the morning first
so the next day, i switched to using it at night.
it was better than in the morning
after the product had all night to absorb
i would apply it at night
i used it nightly, right before going to bed.
/or during the dry
i decided to give this a try at night for 7 days.
i got this as a 7 day trial from influenster
i tried this day 1.
same happened on day two.
i'll not use it fo the full 7 day trial.
when i woke up in the morning my skin felt so much softer
i put this on day and night, nothing happened.
summer heat in my area
tried it on the next day again.
after my nighttime face routine
i tried again the following day .
i can only use it at night
so don't put it on during the day
make sure to only use it at night
fresher skin when i use this at night
i applied this at night
it stays on overnight
resumed my regular routine
after a few hours i felt that my skin got dry
i would wake up the next morning as if i went to bed the night before without putting anything on
i wash my face at night
i really do like the on the go cleanser until i put on my makeup in the morning
this was when my skin was being really oily during the summer
when i first put on this product in the morning it works great
i saw no results from using this at night
this broke up my makeup when i applied it in the morning
i put it on before bed at night for a week
i used it in the morning before putting on my makeup
by the end of the day my face was very dry
this morning i hardly put any on
i've used it for about a week as a night cream
the next day it pretty much feels the same as it did when i went to bed
having to blot every hour
even during the day
two hours after i put this on my face
i still use it at night in my neck
after just 1 wk of consistent every night i woke up w such an oily face
i used it the night before
then i wore it in the morning
the powder lasted all day without a primer
it was a hot day
i've used this every morning
i applied this during my nightly routine
even on my neck on days that i used this
i put this on at night
i used this before bed
only a couple when i woke up
as the day went on more
i'll use this til the bottle runs out because it was expensive
i used this serum before bed for 3 nights in a row
i would put it on then after a few minutes put on my moisturizer
bought this cream to use at night time after applying my olehenriksen night transformation gel
i wake up every morning looking like i just left the gym
heavy throughout the day
by mid day i get very oily
for the first week or so, my skin was ok.
i gave it a good 4 months before i decided to exercise sephora's awesome return policy
okay for around the house or at night
tried to use it at night
most use this at night.
still had it on my face the next morning
tacky to touch even after hours of application it is very different as i had put it on in in the morning
even by midnight that day it was still tacky
i put it on in the morning
i still feel the wax on my face 4 hours later
i tried it last night
sometimes i woke in the morning
the one time i tried wearing it before bed
i put this on in the afternoon
will use on my feet until it runs out.
then sometime in 08 or 09
n then the smell will stay strongly for at least half an hour until it starts fading off xd i don't know how awesome
lingered on the skin for hours.
unfortunately the next morning i noticed i had many pimples on my t-zone area
my face is super oily by the end of my 8 hour shift
every time i used it
had to wash it off every time it used it
it was part of the "on a clear day" line.
worse in the morning
i woke up to new large blemishs every morning
pretty much every night, but minimum 5x a week.
the first few nights of applying it to my under eye were great
i usually have to put it on twice a day
once in the morning before i put on makeup
stay up pretty late at night
wake up early in the morning for work
after applying it each morning/night
i switched to using it only at night
it can be used morning and night, which i do.
when i woke up in the morning
let alone helping with morning puffyness in the under eye area
i now use it as my night eye cream
does the job at night
i put it on in the morning after i washed my face
let it sit for about 5 minutes before rinsing off
i decided to use the mask twice day as daily face wash
just got this product today
saturday night i decided to try this cream for the first time
by day 3 or 4 it was too heavy for my skin
this is great if used in the morning
i used it yesterday
when i woke they were about the same
i tried it in the morning as recommended
use in the morning when i don't have make up on to remove
i returned the bottle the next day in exchange for another one
i woke up the next day with an irritated eye
i'll be returning the product tomorrow
i also use it in the morning.
i got it in a set with the sensitive/normal foreo christmas set
the next morning there would be 5 more in the original's place
i put it on every night for week
i used it one night
it was too late
the next morning i woke up
the darkness that i was expecting
used it for 4 wks and no change at all.
this seems to dry by the time i wake up.
will wait for the tube to finish
i would often forget i had put it on in the morning
i am disappointed mostly because when i wear this i have to reapply it during an 8 hour work day
it didn't matter if i used it at night or during the day under makeup
made my makeup almost disappeared after an hour or so
even in the winter
i used this before bed
i used it after my morning
hours later my skin feels just as dry as before
i literally woke up with other ten pimples one morning
as i am at the end of my second bottle i was reading the ingredients
the same issue happened again almost the next day
my skin tone evening out a little
spent a week slathering my face with this twice a day
shortly after using it
used it that night
today was a no makeup day
skin am going to return it
look refreshed when i wake up in the morning
when i wake up in the morning after applying it
truly it was disappointing when i waited so long for this to arrive in my local sephora
decided to use it every day for a week to be give time to notice results
just put it there once a day---at night
the next day my face was red the whole day
i put this stuff on my nose at night
i used this twice a day until the jar was out morning
a half of using it religiously morning
night i took it back
the next morning my face would be visibly dry
i am at the end
i will continue to finish the bottle
at the same time
don't use it during the day
i tried the cream again the next day
although for a spot here
i only use it in the morning
i posted a review before for this
give it a moment to air dry after each use
within a week i looked like i was back in my teens
however after each use i would wake up to large spots
was gone in the morning
i plan on returning
after washing off my face was red for 4 days
how smooth it leaves my skin for hours after use
the next day, i had only mascara on - same thing!
i put it on in the morning
i used this tonight
i need to wait at least 10 minutes before my skin is "dry"
the oil was way out of control within an hour or so after i put my makeup on
only for about 2 hours until i got extremely greasy
the next day i tried it with makeup
i put it on in the morning under makeup
put it on for a day around the house with no makeup
then tried it overnight
greasy at the same time
shiny during the day
also, my skin was sticky for hours!
skip on this one
halfway through my morning my face was anything
felt heavy after 5 hours of having it on makeup-free skin
basically had to blot 6* during a 12hour day instead of the usual 2*
still have to blot an hour later
by the end of the day my makeup
i apply it twice a day
in the mornings after i wake up
any morning i use this
night for one week
this was okay for nighttime
around the third day
after about a week of daily use in the morning though
i put this is on a few mornings ago
i even went to bed before 12
tried it this morning
when i woke up an hour later
night everyday for a month
i used this product every night until the bottle was empty
on the 4th day of using it
dry during winter and oily in summer.
i am returning it tomorrow.
i wash my face twice a day
after that first day it made me peel after every use
it was burning throughout the day
am using it in my t-zone area only
i used it both at night
i applied this product to my entire face every night for one month to minimize the oil on my skin throughout the day
that didn't bother me since it was applied at night
i will not use it during the day
i realized that i would only be using this on the rare occasion that it was storming all day
my regular anti-aging spf during the day
it also makes my face oily for about an hour after applying
why buy this product when i could put any moisturizer in the freezer for half an hour
just received this after working in the garden all weekend
tried it on my face after an hour at the beach
i tried the product again the next day
used it as a refresher in the morning
forehead after a week of usage unfortunately
after an hour or so
especially not right now during the colder season
maybe better as a night cream?
it stings for a good 20 minutes after i apply it
s feel dry within an hour of using
it felt like it was moisturizing when i put it on at night
i am going to try their night resurgence cream when this bottle is empty
tried for a week after my serum in the morning
made them water for hours
dry at the same time
normally i don't need to touch up my t-zone until around 2pm
received this in a black friday set
it was incredibly greasy even an hour after application
i couldn't wait to get home at lunch
as the day goes on
i could feel the moisturizer on my face for a few hours after i put it on-- something i hate
they next day i had a horrible breakout!
i smelled like a day at the pool all day long
water for hours after application
after about 2 hours my face looks greasy
which was fine at first
irritating throughout the day
i started wearing it at night when i go to bed which is fine
t was suitable for putting on in the morning before my makeup
wonderful in the shower in the morning
when i wash my face after
am starting to get fine lines
i apply it every morning and night.
i am going today to a sephora store to return it
each time i pump it
warm up at first when i apply it
when i woke up the next morning
i tried this once yesterday
i used it every other day when i am in dry areas.
soft for a short period after i wash it off
maybe good for night time
need to re-apply moisturizer during the middle of the day
winter in the bay area
downfall: not good to use year round
that starts with s
good for a night time eye cream.
in the autumn when it is getting cooler
apply it twice daily
whenever i put this on
the next day i always end up with more flakes than usual
it would be good for am during summer
air-conditionned hotel rooms where you cannot open any windows
i might try another day cream from korres
i stopped using it during the day
tried to use it at night
i used this product in the morning before applying make up give or take about 10-15 min to let it set
within the hour i have dry patches showing through my makeup
i used it as both my night
also when i put make up on in the morning after using this moisturizer
my only problem is that when i wake up in the mornings
couldn't wait to try it out before bed
applied it that morning for a second test run
great for night time
which isn't great when i'm rushing to get ready in the morning
a good, basic pm eye cream, though!
put it on before bed
i will try re-applying later in the day
i out it on a night before bed
when i wake up to shower in the morning
it was ok to use at night when i didn't have to face the public
it was okay on the first day
when i wake up in the morning
i apply both morning and night.
i tend to use this at night
after a couple days of using it i started noticing that i would sneeze every time i would wash my face with this product
could clean my whole face at the end of the day
if you're in a rush after a late night
i used it every night in conjunction with the clinique all about eyes sérum
i'll update this review in another month
i used it every night for atleast 60 days
it actually makes me feel more tired when i wake up in the morning
use it every single day
spreads all over my face during the day
can be used in the day time before makeup
i stick to using this at night time only
i applied this at night
when i woke up this morning
that i use at night.
then it also stops working after the second hour
my t-zone became oily after the first two hours
i am left with dry
in 2-3 hours i get oily
by the afternoon i need to blot
it also doesn't cause shine later in the day.
after a couple of hours the dryness started to slighty show again
is perfect for when you come home from a stressful day at work
especially after a late night
unfortunately didn't last all day
my skin would revert by to its dry self the next morning
by the first week of april
after a solid week of using it every am
sometimes thru out the day
like i said early
my face burned for hours
i wasnt out in the sun
i think i'll put this away until winter time
the minute i used it
using the remainder on the back of my h
i used my clarisonic after this
on my closed eyes for a fair amount of time
sensitive skin was needing at the end of the day
first time i put it on it was really late at night 3 a
i heard the earlier you start
used it last night before my husb
after a while in the car
good for morning wash
every time i would put it in a bag for an overnight or travel
i started using this in the morning to start my skincare routine
i placed this order on the 7th at 8:28 am which was a friday
they did not process my order till the 10th
i know i placed the order on a friday
the employees of the store could have processed my order in store on friday
send it out to usps on monday
i could have received my order on wednesday instead of today
why wasn't the processing of my order started on the 7th instead of the 10th?
it usually takes a day to calm down
if i didn't break out a day after using it :
until i found this one
i find myself using this in the morning
same messy results each time.
while using this my make up looked so greasy after like 2 hours
not only on all day
maybe gives me an extra hour in the morning before i need to blot/powder
at the end of the day
it would only be good to use in the morning on an already clean face from the night before
can't even address the brightening effects because i had to wash it off after 5 minutes
even when i waited an entire stinking half hour!
i put it on at night
burning all night long
eventhough it mattifies the skin at the beginning
helps with oil when used at night
evening on just on my t-zone
it wasn't available at the one near my hotel
after using it i don't feel refreshed at all
i woke up the next day with several blemishes on my face
left them stinging for an hour
have loved the take the day off balm.
put it on before bed time
great for the winter time
when i wake up in the morning i find my skin feels dry
went to the local sephora store for a night cream
even for at night
s during the night
my face feels a little tight in the morning after i've used the night emulsion
rather than waking up to a moiturized refreshed face
'd wear it at night
i tried it at night
i applied this at night
throughout the course of the day
i used it morning and night.
i will use it at night only.
i will put it on at night
my eye area would dry out during the day
if i skip washing my face for a night
even after blotting my face was super oily again an hour later
this product will keep me shine free for about 3 hours
instead i was an oily mess before noon
a couple hours later it makes my face super super oily
my skin still ends up oily at the end of the day.
about an hour later i'm full on grease-face.
i do find that i have to do a bit of blotting around the 5-6 hour mark
sometimes it would even show up an hour after putting the lotion on
oily in my t zone by lunchtime
it was the same deal every day
plus by day 4 i was getting dry
it's not shine free during the day
it seems like my face gets oily now after an hour of it being on
i am still pretty shiny by the end of the day.
thought i would try this for a night cream
then after about an hour feels super greasy
i can only use it at night time
wake up with big pores in the morning
i will use it at night
it was too late for me to return
way too heavy for day time
i only use it at night.
used this product with that before bed everyday
i noticed it after every wash
it was still feeling tight at the end of the day
try again in the spring
i just using this in the morning for a quick refresh
after my cleanser at night then on top of that i use boscia recharging night moisture
i tried this during the winter
/or am very stressed out i might neglect my face cleaning nightly routine
staying out in the sun
it was so annoying to get it to come out every morning
i'll be returning it this weekend.
drink at least 6 cups of water a day
if i put it on right before i go to bed
so the first time i tried this product my skin looked amazing the morning after
peeling the morning after i used this
re-applying during the day didn't help
i stick to using this at night time only
while i don't use it every night
at 3 pm i would be a water slide
could use it in the morning
then as a second cleanser for the evening
i am taking it back.
day four was a a wake-up call.
soothing when you can't fall asleep
it was ok during the day.
i smelled it strongly in the evenings when i placed my head to my pillow
might be okay for spring/summer
it did leqve my skin refreshed the next day
this one made my eyes miserable for an hour
every time i used it at night
when i first put it on in the morning
the next day my skin was dry
i would apply this product before bedtime
a few times i left it on all day instead of rinsing my face
while this is the best night cream i've ever used
the second time it didn't work at all
i like to wash my whole face at night including my eyes
some natural oils come through several hours into my day
i still get some new breakouts during the day
that usually only happens to me during the winter
as i am over 50
my face was stingy during the day
used the product once in the morning
this will be returned...
only use it at night
here is a backgroun on my skin: mid 20's
i only use it in the evening.
i could only use it at night because when i put on my moisturizer in the morning it would pill up??
i still wake up to new ones avery morning.
maybe better for after cleansing 1st
this happened with their clear days ahead moisturizer
it made face break out the next day after using it
i followed directions using this product every evening following the i'm sure it will work over time
loved the way my skin looked in the morning
my skin feels tight after an hour of application.
i put the "dry" version on at night for 3 nights.
the same thing happened again the next morning
the search for a great night cream continues.
my search for a good night cream is still on.
i am almost out.
felt first 2 nights of using this cream
on the third night of using it i woke up in the morning with red
pm every day for about 6 weeks now
on the nights i did not use it
i am finishing up the bottle
i am on middle of my second bottle of this
year round sun protection
the temporary results don't last long enough to make it through my workday
it was ok for days i stayed home
it just got worse every day
which i was just beginning to get
by the end of the workday it looked like i'd run a marathon instead of sitting behind a desk
definitely made me oily within 2-3 hours
the first morning i used this
i woke up with dull
this morning i woke up with hot
gets in my hair during the night
this product left my skin feeling dry after a couple of hours
i like its day moisterizer.
because i know anyone who washes their face every night before going to bed
used it twice a day morning
night until i ran out
the day after my skin was so dry
i used this every night for a whole week
just after one night
clean the morning after
only used it before bed
in the am i never left the house without any sunscreen on my face
i am going to return this
night as a spot treatment
i've used a pump of this all over my face morning
not even an hour sometimes
by the end of the work day
i break out like a mountain range the next morning
i find that my skin get really oily shortly after application
after an hour i just happened to look my face in the mirror
i put it on woke up the next morning with 4 new pimples
turn red in one night
this is the first night cream i've ever used.
i will probably return next time i'm at sephora.
i used it for about five nights with the same result each night
under my make up in the morning
ing on a counter top or in the shower
it didn't take off my makeup in the evening
by day fiour i returned it
this was in the morning.
i used it at night
used this product under my make up in the morning
after i wash my face at night
my skin looked so greasy for hours after
put it on before my makeup before i went out that night
i even tried it only before bed
i don't use it twice a day.
i started using this in the am
i switched to using it only at night.
just use it before i go to bed or during the day i don't ware make up
especially during the winter
i used twice a day evrey single day on my laugh lines
was the first day i used it
i am going to use the entire jar before
since day 1 every time i put it on soon after i wake up with breakouts everywhere
i leave this mask on for 15 minutes
next morning i woke up to red
fresh for the day
planning on returning it today.
bright in the morning
used it day and night.
every morning i'd wake up
lie awake most of the night wondering
i did use this faithfully morning and night, too.
i used it faithfully morning and night for weeks.
put it on my skin overnight
it doesn't even last until morning
my skin was just more dry after using this morning
i still had flakiness on my face after an hour or so
i wake up the next day with dry patches
it breaks down your makeup within an hour of application
5 oz in the beginning of the winter
tried it last night
i even tried just using it at night time
i put it on at night
i would put this on in am before making breakfast
when i apply it in the mornings the moment i apply my make up
i could still smell it on my face several hours after i put it on
tend to use a small amount in the evenings before bed
am returning it to the store for an exchange
nice----for about the 1st month
every day i use this
my under-eye areas feel dry before lunch
i am 32 with dry
i work a lot of night shifts.
on one eye this time
still felt the oil slick in the morning from when i put it on the night before
i am in my late 20s
i continued using it for a third day
i now use it in the morning
with my late 40 combo skin
then when i'm too tired to go through my regular cleansing routine
i found my skin started to peel the next day every time i used it
especially during the winter
maybe it's better for the summer instead of the middle of a northeast winter
when i was in sephora
hitting summer in nyc
i get good results from ren's night cream
at home after using it
i could just use this as a night cream
happened every time i used it
i used this cream this morning
i used all the pods in the pack, one per week.
shortly after my skin felt dry
i left it on for about two hours before i couldn't st
i broke out the next morning.
i wouldn't use it in the daytime.
i used it in the morning after cleansing
i am not taking this chance again.
i didn't notice any difference in my skin after using it every day for a week
ts not fair for me i saw results from using it for weeks
tried it out as a night cream the other night
next day skin was ok
15 minutes later, i still had a shine to my face.
my face felt greasy after using it at night
when i use it at night my skin looks great in the morning
only wore it at night
i like it best at night
i used it after washing my skin before bed
i would use it in the morning
i love the over night mask though!
the cooling effect on the face would be wonderful in summer
usually the two go h
every morning i wake up with at least 1 new pimple
either got home late or am feeling lazy
felt great going on but skin was dry hours later.
i then tried wearing in morning, under my makeup.
even with overnight use
for at home use
i wanted to get ahead of the dry winter weather
i only sit in a shower 1-2 times per week
it sits there for hours
the fact that it was spf 20 instead of the st
i looked oily mid-day and tired!
i like it for day time
i decided to switch to this one for the summer
especially once it starts to get warm outside
by the afternoon my skin was oilier than normally
every morning there was a new little red bump at a new location on my face
got the "youth surge day
just walk out the door on a lazy morning without makeup layered on top
but my face begins to burn after applying it.
it maybe lasted for an hour before my face looked oily again
unfortunately i am past the window of time where i can return to sephora
after 4 days of use as a night time cream
i definitely had a shine most of the day
woke up glowing every morning
i am in my late 20's
tried it on before i went to bed
i still have to touch up with powder at least twice a day
after a few hours i looked like a greasy mess !
normal on the rest of my face
i found my face becoming oily after about an hour after application
when i use it before going to bed i do not see much oil on my nose in the morning
i also blot my face every few hours.
during cold weather months
i plan on trying it again during the summer
it kept me "matte" for like 2 1/2 hours
it worked for like 2 hrs
i break out every time i use it
an hour or 2 into my air conditioned work day
usually i stay oil free for 4 hours
i say i was shine free for 6 hours max
let alone after an entire day
oily t-zone after about 1 hour
i used this under my make up for a day
about an hour you will be a shiny mess
in the afternoon park of my face skin peeling off
i used it during the day
ended up either having to reapply it again within the hour or just going back my regular moisturizer
every day doesn't work out
i did notice my face looked somewhat brighter when waking up in the morning
i apply it on top of the genefique every morning
at the end of the day when i cleanse my face
i am on week 3 of using this during the day
this also goes for the night version.
absolutely unable to wear this under makeup or on days when i can't stay home all day
i hope it does not end up all on my pillow while i sleep
don't make the mistake of using this in the morning
look awful by the end of the day
i want it to work overtime on my skin while i sleep
i tired it at night
also using this along with the genefique eye concentrate at night
my eyes are refreshed in the morning
once its on for a minute or so the burning sensation begins to subside
i used this for one week in the evening.
when i woke up
it sits on top of my skin until i massage it for a minute or so
then flaky a day later
i am on to the next thing
at the end of the day
i returned the product because after hours of wear
the morning after i used it
the night cream from the same line
i would wake up in the morning with skin that was tight
i workout 6 days a week
instead of easing into it, i used it each night.
definitely returning this tomorrow
i did not have that morning before i applied
it came on during the day
it was the only thing i used on my face until bed time
wears off within an hour
i went to a makeup party last week
but i find that i only use it in the morning.
at first i was happy with the results.
while i was using this cleanser in the am/pm i noticed it did really make my skin feel tight
i would still become oily midday
when i woke up the next morning my entire face was covered in bumps
noticing a different the next morning
i would not recommend using this before bed.
i apply it on my skin twice a day
may re-review again when it's not winter time.
i tried t during the day after washing my face
i got this in a set as a full size on black friday
throughout the day i got dryer
use it once daily
i found my skin to be more oily than average by mid-day
after 1 week, it was drying up my skin.
i would wake up with them
after going on vacation without it
i apply this product right before going to bed
lounge around for a very long time before applying makeup or leaving your house
am still hoping that by the time i finish the bottle
it made my face very oily later in the day
a good one in autumn n spring
i tried this on during an amorepacific event in store
i sent it back the next day!
but i didn't even last 5 minutes with it on.
had to wash it off twice before i could st
until i apply it
after the 3rd-4th day
i am returning it and testing another line.
the day after that
i am on my second tube now
which was great for the morning
i cut back from two applications a day to just one at night
i still found my face to be more oily during the day
i used it two nights
it did not live up to the claim of brightening the skin in one week
would go along with my regular routine
i am almost through with the whole bottle
i used it weekly until the tube was gone
leaving it on for 15 minutes each time
the only thing i didn't like about this product was after a few minutes of washing it off
the morning after i use it my skin
after reading all the reveiws
then when i put my make up on the next day
pm i found no difference at all
each night before bed i dab the product on
i am early 40s.
i still wake up feeling like a grease pot the next morning
a little softer in the morning after a good night's rest
i left that day
once every 10 days ish
this makes my skin feel good for about an hour after i use this
at $100 for the set
seeing as the cream was the only item that i changed in routine the night before
i put it on my clean face this morning.
used it one morning
one night on the face
i gave this a try for a few nights
i am in my mid 30's
after a few minutes way to greasy for my skin
i'll just use the rest as a night cream.
after a month i saw her again.
nights while holding my breath
decided to apply on a cold winter day knowing is have to re-wash my face after my work out
the smell was so pungent on my face a half-hour after applying that i had to re-wash my face
i still smelled it after an hour of being on my face
i can't speak for the results because on my first night using this
i still got a hint of it in the morning
i will never go near it again
let it sit in the sun for a few hours
decided to try it this morning
i applied it before bed
when i first got this in the summer
i even used the spot corrector at the same time
my skin tone is evening out
i only apply this before bed
one day i went outside on a really cold day
at first i used it right before i got to bed
i can only use it at night bc it's impossible to apply makeup over it during the day
i am almost finish one jar
only positive thing that i noticed from using this was the much needed hydration it gave my eyes during the cold winter months here in chicago
my makeup slides around all day when i put it on in the morning
when i put it on at night with the high resolution eye cream
finally started using an eye cream everyday twice a day
the morning after using this i had a breakout
i got this with the holiday trio.
i opened it yesterday
i used it everyday before bed
i used it til it was empty
i'll use it till its gone
after the third or fourth day
i used this day and night for a good solid month.
night with no results
it definitely woke up tired eyes up in the morning
needs to dry for a minute after you put it on
i put this on in the morning after i wash my face
but the next morning i had two new pimples.
i still can feel it washing off my face in the morning
i couldn't keep it on for 3 minutes
noticed before we went to sleep
returning first thing tomorrow :/
i used them every day
while this did the trick in the summer
i could smell it all day as i went about my day.
i get really red in the morning after i take a shower
i gave up after the fourth night.
i apply this every night after i cleanse
the first night i tried it
i used it every night for a week
every morning was a disappointment
i am at a loss on what to try next
will update my review once i pass 30 days with this
i am taking this one back
used it every day
my face was greasy a couple of hours after application
use it religiously every morning
is usually shining by mid-day
forehead by the afternoon
mattifying for about the first 20 minutes that i put it on
my skin gets very oily about an hour after application
so not best for the morning if you don't have a ton of time to wait between morning routine
am finishing up the jar by using it on my h
i washed my face before bed like normal
i applied this product shortly afterwards
when i woke up in the morning
am returning this one
i returned it shortly after.
though it was too heavy for summer
i am not ready for that period
when i used it at night i would wake up with a literal shine over my whole face
i put on an extra sunscreen in the morning.
by mid day or when i'm waking up
test out the waters before you commit
after 4 hours i can still feel it on my skin
i am also more oily in my t-zone than i was before
my face gets pretty shiny a few hours after use.
this would be good for brightening your face up after a night of little sleep or too much drinking
i noticed that after an hour of application my under eye was dry
use it every morning
dark circles on nights i don't sleep well
refreshing in the morning
this will keep fluid on a downhill trek during the night so that it doesn't collect in your face
used 2 pumps morning and evening.
i am in my early 30's
i put it on in the morning
i will be returning this product tomorrow.
i put the murad on before i put on my makeup primer in the mornings
i am in my early thirties are starting to pay closer attention to "preventative maintenance"
i tried using it in the morning before applying makeup many times
after leaving it all night
for me, i woke up w/ a stye the next morning.
even in the summer where i am always looking refresh
i decided to keep it on and pray for the best.
mediocre results after 1 month of am
the next time i put it on the smell was there again
won't go near this again!
i try to sleep in this
i will update the results later.
the smell does wear off after an hour or so
i will be returning this tomorrow.
t will be returned
only used it at night
i sat on the couch after applying the cream
i put it on in the morning and eyes look great.
felt nauseous for a couple of hours after putting it on
does fade after an hour or so
i only wear it when i go to the beach
no where near $40 worth
this was definitely a heavier day cream than i am used to wearing
oily t-zone in the afternoon
not for late summer usage
tried it morning and night for 2 weeks.
i know i am not super oily at the end of the day
this was my first night using it
first week it did miracles
i would use this at night
wake up the next morning with an oily sheen all over my face
within an hour it would go back to feeling dry
to put this on an oncoming blemish i expect something to happen over night or even a couple of nights in a row
this showed up under recommendations for a night cream
i tried this nighttime treatment
i'll be returning it today.
i spent over an hour waiting to peel it off.
i tried the mask last night
this morning i woke up to a full on break out on my face
is great for relaxing before bed
s on it this week
especially during hot weather
my foundation did not sit well on my skin after application of this cream in the am
the directions say it's for am or pm use
i only used this at night
after using it morning
at night- it never felt like it would soak in at all
feels greasy in the morning when u wake up
tried it one night
stayed greasy feeling for hours
tried using just for night cream
it will make a good day time moisturizer for no make up days
an hour later it looked as if i had sun poisoning
within an hour, my skin looked as dry as ever.
i applied this at night
used it at night with my normal routine
i woke up in the morning
when checked 3 hours later my skin was parched.
after using the entire bottle daily
reduce to only using it during the night
i used it at night as well in the morning
used the last of it tonight
on days where i didn't leave my house
at first, i was happy with this cream.
starting on the third day of usage
i put it on clean skin at night
in the morning had red
continued using at night
it was the only new product in my routine
every morning i would wake up with my skin even more broken out
recently started to use this morning
great to use in the morning
i used it at night
i gave it a try for one week as the only new addition to routine set of products used on my face on a daily basis
feel the oil on my skin still over an hour after applying it
maybe i could use this at night
see a result in the morning
daily night and day use.
i used this eye cream at night time
every time i use this cream under my eyes i wake up with tired
i put on a lot at night
oily to even attempt to wear it during day time
i put this on before i go to bed
i let it set for the allotted time
only get tiny breakouts during flow's visit
doesn't feel like i still need to wash it off an hour later
then by the end of the day
my skin felt the same as when i woke up before using a moisturizer
since the warm weather is here
another time in the morning with no other products other than my usual cleanser
night for about a week
have been using it as my nightly moisturizer for the last week to try it out
used it religiously every day until i had emptied it
i don't have 15 minutes every day to sit
once i was in the sun
i will be returning this before the holidays
it leaves me really shiny after only a few hours
put it on at home
whenever i use it i would breakout the next day
am planning on returning it
nice to rub on at night
it's really cooling for the under eye in the morning
its helps to depuff in the morning
while the roller feels nice after a restless night or an evening of partying
once it starts to work
when i want to use it at night before i go to bed
an hour later i find myself feeling dry again
less shine for this winter season
i can't put it on at night before i go to bed because the smell will wake me up if i put my h
since starting this cream
later in the afternoon
maybe there is a "darkness before the dawn"??
i am moving on from this.
i will switch to night until i finish the bottle
i got this product on saturday
i noticed after 4 days of using it twice a day that my face just felt parched
greasy omggg i look like ive been outside on a summer day literally
i will apply this at least 30 minutes before i plan on putting on makeup
use it as a night time neck cream
after two nights i got a milia under my left eye
five stars on that note
this cream just stayed on the surface for hours
it was still sticky in the morning when i woke up
i am going to return it
after waking up after wearing this over night
i could see a difference in my skin the first time using it i woke up with a glow
i put a sample size on my face after cleansing tonight
i returned it the next day.
when i would wake up in the morning my pores actually enlarged
at least finish it
use both morning & night.
i am in my mid30's with normal skin that is starting to show a few fine lines
i prefer their night cream.
an hour after applying
i will wait until the jar is empty
after my 'rest' i used it again.
found that the next morning
my mid-morning i am feeling the dryness.
after about an hour or so i need to wash my face.
lifting cream all the time- day
i will be finishing it
my undereye area would look dry in the morning
i took a picture prior to the first day of use.
night as an under eye cream
the first night i started to use it
believe this runs into my eyes at night when i sleep
i only wear foundation on special occasions
i waited 5 minutes to look in the mirror
my entire face will glow like a ghost after 3 hours
while commuting he said "your wearing that stuff again"
night with fab results above
today was my first day using this product
i needed a moisturizer that had spf when i want to lounge around the house or when i am not going to put on any makeup
just like the night cream
i used it during the winter and it was perfect.
i wore it during the day once
i did wear it overnight
my skin felt great in the morning
the only time i get pimples in when i'm about to start my girl time
i stopped using it for one night
put some on before i went to bed last night
i put it on twice a day
i could smell this at night in my sleep
feeling like i put perfume on before going to bed
after 1 use, i expect to wake up to soft skin.
i put it on mainly as my heavy night cream
also during the day when my skin is really dry
i woke up with a super oily skin，so no，wouldnt recommend
after i stop using this cream
i applied it day
night every single day
i find in the canadian winter months i can use this in the morning
now going into spring i can only use this before bed
by the end of my work day
prepare for the sting
i take off my makeup like usually before i go to bed
i am in my early 30s
continued to burn for about 15 minutes
despite consistent use in the morning
a nice eye cream that is great at night before bed
the cytocell is fine for evening use
only used it at night
when i put this on in the am
decided to try it after a night of not sleeping well
s in the winter time
over again that this would take care of those pesky under eye circles that i have from the late nights
mornings that seem to come too soon
am going to return it
i used it morning and night.
especially in the winter
), but i'm happy to use fab 5-in-1 until then.
switched to using it every other night
it felt like my eyes were especially watery the next day after having put it on before bed-time
i could feel product washing off in the shower the next morning
can get oily in the t-zone at the end of the day
i put it on my face later on that night
i didn't like it and returned it shortly after.
my skin was red the next day
after 20 minutes of usuage my eyes starts to burn
since i use a separate spf on my entire face
i returned since i didn't want to buy a separate night eye cream
i am returning this eye cream.
my eyes were watering for hours after applying this
for the first week or two this product tingled a bit on application
my skin was red for hours afterwards
am going to give it another week.
when i woke up this morning
i wear it at night
by morning i'll have cried it all off
when i wore it at night
my under-eye area was very dry in the morning
dark circles i find a cold pack for 5 minutes in the morning is much more effective
i would wake up in the morning
got the same result every time
if i use this in the morning
by the end of the day
after a couple sleepless night due to the itching i stopped using it
when i put it on at night under my moisturizer i had the same result
i will update my review in another 2 weeks.
i am going to finish my 1st bottle soon.
i put it on each morning after cleansing
each night before bed
i gave up and will come back to eve lom cleanser.
face felt like i still had product on it for hours afterwards
cleanse my face at night
i mostly use this in the winter or light make up days
i started putting it on my face at night.
so when in the market for an overnight cream
when it came time to replace my night cream by another br
smooth the next morning
next time i'll try another br
for my night cream
applied it last night woke up
did my normal morning face wash routine
day cream for the first time
it left my skin dry in an hour!
i gave it a full 7 nights trial
within 10 minutes i felt like i hadn't put on any moisturizer at all
i really like how this night sleeping mask calm my skin
now i'm using it every night
i used twice at night
every morning i woke up with flaky skin which i never had a problem with
turnaround overnight didn't even sink in by the next morning
for day or night
the second day i break-out
i've had this happen with every night cream i've tried
especially at bed time
every time i tried this
it usually lasts for around 30 seconds.
a half using it morning
i started trying the eye cream as part of a daily routine to "wake up" my tired looking skin
it felt drying during the day
big as they were before i went to sleep
if it doesn't work the second week return it
when i wake up in the morning my blemishes are either the same or worse
at first it works
maybe the first or second night
once you get to the third night you use it as a spot treatment
hours later or even the next day if i apply it at night
while this did shrink spots overnight
great for winter not summer.
also love the night-a-mins night cream.
my face still looked rather greasy after half hour
i think i'll start using it as a night cream on my face
at first i thought maybe it was my korres 24 hr.
so the following day
this was much lighter than i expected for a night cream
therefore the fragrances made me break outing dry patches the next morning
it didn't disappear for about an hour
my skin is dry in the morning!
which surprises me because when i put it on before bed
dry skin at the same time until i tried this product
after i put it on at night
when first opening the package
when i wake up in the morning
do not use this on your day time routine
smooth in the morning
at first i was obsessed with this night cream
i applied it at night after my regular skin care routine
unfortunately the next morning my face was red
woke up the next morning to several little breakouts on my face
my makeup apply smoothly after i'd let it set for about 5 minutes
he washes his face about once a week
the only thing that happened to my face was how oily it was the next morning
good for when sleeping.
i only apply eye moisturizer in the evening before bed
switched to using it nightly
i would recommend it for a am/pm eye cream.
no de puffing in the morning
i found my eyes dry when i woke up in the mornings
i think i'll just keep it for night time
i am in school pulling all nighters
i still have a face full of oil at the end of the day
good to put in the shower for morning washing.
then one week of twice daily my t-zone was incredibly oily
only use it at night
everytime i use it i get break out the next day.
after i wash it off
definitely go for the drink up overnight mask instead
because i love the drink up overnight mask
it stays sticky for the entire 10 minutes
i used it yesterday for the first time in awhile because it was the only moisturizer i had h
i can only wear this at night before bed
instead of daily switch to every other day
by afternoon i was oily.
it did not control my oils during the day
well it left my t zone very shiny after an hour.
feel oily again maybe 30 minutes after application
within 2 hours i was a shiny mess again
i break out every time i use it
on nights i wore this mask
left it on 20 minutes
i am in my 20s with regular breakouts from period
i only used one pump in morning and at night.
i still get oily after couple hours with or without makeup
i would never use it in the morning
i planned to use it at night.
applied it in the evening
a couple hours later i could tell my dry areas looked worse than when i use my regular cream
i returned it the very next day.
i used one pump in the day and one at night.
twice a day til the jar was finished
now last night i was doing an extended routine with a mask
thought it was a little heavy for daytime
woke up the next morning
i suppose i'll try it on the rest of the orbital area
ii see no improvement in the bags i am beginning tp get
i typically wore this at night after washing my face
sometimes in the morning depending on how my skin looked when i woke up
after i apply it on my face
i usually use it at night after steps 1
i am putting this on a hiatus for a bit.
when i started using it at night in the summer
sticky for about 30 min after you leave it on
i put it on in the morning
i get dry spots year round
my make up flakes so much after just 2 hours of wearing it
every day i woke up to a couple new pimples
i didn't mind that as i applied it at night before bed
best to use over night
i took a shower in the morning
6 hours later it still sitting on my skin
i woke up with a couple new breakouts
i am only in my early 30s--
can only use it at night
i just finished the bottle this morning after 5 months of daily use
a regular one during the day
this product was suggested to me in the store as a daily face wash to combat afternoon oiliness
after sitting in front of a computer all day
that i actually ended up oilier in the afternoon than before using this product
good for normal day
the product would only be warm for a second or two in my h
clean during the washing period
purchases about a hour later my skin was dry again had to return wasn't satisfied
as soon as i was finished with my nightly facial routine
there are some mornings when i wake up
i like this for de-puffing in the morning
jelly at the same time when i tried it at the store
every time i apply it there is a slight burn for about 30 seconds
just a few hours after putting on my skin felt heavy
i decided to go back to the korres 24 hour moisture for my day cream
use the brightening nighttime mask for at night
after about an hour, i started to see the shine.
i didn't notice any difference in the mornings
then i wanted to use my glam glow a few hours later
i woke up the next morning
still use it at night here
later on wanted to know if i was wearing bug spray to bed
i tried the product on my face for the first time last night
wearing it at night while i slept ended up keeping me from having a good night's rest
everytime i use this at night the following morning i will have bumps on my forehead
this night cream left me with a super oily sking every morning
i did leave it on all night
i am almost at the end of the jar
i found that when i wore this overnight i noticed my skin was softer in the morning
let it dry for an hour or so
i still have dry patches the next day
i usually sleep 8+ hours
set off a migraine after being on my face for about an hour
however after one night of use of this product
i will give it another shot in the winter.
i will be going back to eve lom
i am in my late 20's
i am at the end of bottle #3
it's just fine at night
after a few nights of gagging as i put this on my face
i think i'll save this one for night time use
the first time i put it on
decided to just use it as a night cream
all that excitement went away when i woke up the next morning with an extremely tight feeling face
i returned it the next day
i also noticed my skin peeling off every morning i wake up
i could still smell it a few hours later when going to bed
it would keep my skin oil free for about 2 hours.
greasy after about an hour or 2 of having applied it
at night as a treatment
i've never in my life had a product make my face look greasy after a couple hours
be at work at six in the morning
t's extra cooling in the morning
i am in my mid-20's
i get pretty puffy eyes the morning after i'm up late
applying it before bed
then in the morning
feels good if you had a late night
i am definitely not a morning person
the final time i used it
was too late to return it
the day after using this cream
which normally gets a little oily in the t-zone by midday
just t-zone shine part way through the day
will try it n the winter
best to wait a good half hour at least for it to sink into the skin before applying makeup
until i wash it off
in the beginning it did make my skin feel smooth when i put it on overnight
i did like this more than the luna night oil
or evening skin tone
tried it for 3 nights
the 1st night i put it on
applied it again a little bit the 2nd night
i went through it again the 3rd night
i left it on maybe 25 minutes
night for about a week
my t-zone was still oily by the end of the day
was so excited to get this cleanser in the play box this month
as for the smell, come on sunday.
this made my face look great after the first week of use
i only used it at night-- it's way too heavy for daytime
which i use morning
onward with my search for a solid night cream!
after about 4 days of wearing it morning
i used it before bed
especially for night time use
it definitely makes my skin look younger when i wake up in the morning
also after 2 hours i was still an oil slick
it appears reduce eye bags for 6-8 hrs.
i just got this yesterday
when i'd wake up in the morning
until the next day
on to the next one for me.
i did find that if i wore this morning
i felt like after a few hours my skin was shiny
however after the 4th-ish week it had stopped working
it takes a few nights to get some results
i now use tree tea oil i notice results after one night
i used it 3 times a day until it was empty.
tried it one night
when i first got this product in the winter
i tried this cream in the summer
i kept it on for 18 minutes.
i expected to fall off
basically you take a 15 minute nap!
i put it in the fridge overnight
used it the following morning as i wanted to look my best at an important meeting
next-morning or at the end of a long day tiredness situation
i spent many hours this particular day crying
i must use it at night
continue use at night only
only use it at night
i only apply before bedtime.
when i got home at night
the best way i found it worked was to apply it at night after cleansing
apply make-up in the morning without washing your face again
put this on at 7 in the morning
the first time i put it on
used it only at night
again when i was on day 10
the first night my face was red in the middle of the night when i got up
this product is good for the evening only.
i used it in the morning
i really only have dry skin late winter to early spring
my clothing even after an hour
will return the product on my next visit to sephora
on the dry patches at night
i wore it overnight
all night in bed it was driving me crazy
i left it on for 15 minutes
especially in the winter
i am going to return this product.
will use it until it's empty
this was when i tried it at the store on my h
at night time i washed my face
the first night i used it
on the second night
on the second night
warm water ready to go before applying the first time
it calms down after an hour or so
i am on my third tube of this stuff
i used this cream consistently everyday till the last drop
i used it every morning
and then i figure it's for morning and night.
at night my dark circles didn't go anywhere i am returning this as soon as possible
i finished the bottle this week
my dark circles appear the same as they did from the night i start using it
have since my late teens
i am in my early 30's
it's especially dry when i used it during the day
was getting breakouts in the morning
used this as my 2nd to last step in nighttime routine
skin even feels drier after wake up in the morning
i put this on at night before bed
my skin is dry by the morning
when i used it for the first time at night it felt very heavy
at the end of the day
then at around day 4 of nightly use i noticed that my t-zone had more blackheads than usual
i continued for one more week using it every other night
this made my skin feel great on the first night
personally used it overnight
they were a bit calmer the next day
after a full week of use as instructed
even when not used every day
my acne looks the exact same in the morning after doing the night treatment
even after you've slept in it overnight
i like that when i wake up in the morning my face is still moisturized
when i wake up in the morning
i simply cannot spend nearly $200 on a night cream
every morning i wake up to dry skin
i didn't go out into the sun during treatment.
i used the product every night
it irritated my skin during the first week
my face started to itch whenever i put this on after the 3rd week
sometimes i would develop one or two white heads the end of the day after this at night time
a nice wake-up scent for my morning routine.
it was a bad idea to try this during winter time
i will note that it is the middle of winter
have to go to bed right after i use this
off through out the day
wash it off because it kept me awake for 1/2 an hour
it seems that by noon
were sometimes red at the end of the day
after an hour on
i used this for 2 nights
it doesn't even brighten after 30 days
even in humid summer
oily throughout the day
i got more oily than usual during the day.
i will continue to use it as a spot treatment or at night
once in the morning
i used it during summer when my skin was less dry
i ordered during winter
i tried to use it at night instead of in the morning
i stopped using it during the day
tried using it as a night cream only
about an hour after i apply it my face looks
dry out at the same time
by the end of the day
will continue using this until the jar is empty
wakes you up in the morning
when i went to use it at the end of the third week low
it's going back to sephora tomorrow!!
it is still sitting on my night st
night as it is recommended
all-in-one night treatment for my skin
you're supposed to leave this on for ten minutes
no where near the same anti aging results as before
6 months later... i am not impress.
my time in the morning is too precious to waste waiting for this to dry
f i plan to go makeup-less for a day i have to skip this in the morning
no evening out of tone or brightening
a sticky feeling that lasts for hours
although they recommend using it morning
not when- is it a night cream?
i find it to heavy for day wear
it also soothed her skin after all day out in the sun
i used the product morning
when i apply it at night
the next morning there seems to be a film residue that comes off in the shower
when i apply it in the morning
i don't have the same experience when i wash my face before bed
maybe due to length of time on the skin?
am holding out until i have used the entire bottle
after i wash it off
maybe one day the fine lines
i am almost done with the cream
the next morning my under eye area felt smoother
until this one, of course.
spot test it first
i tried this all over my face last night.
figured i needed to stay on over night
m the night prior
then i am returning
have been using it as a night cream
it's on the lighter side when i apply it after cleansing before bed
s before the bed
love this for the nighttime
it broke me out the next morning
my face is still oily about mid-day
at night i am on the search for something thicker
i put it on in the morning
that i usually do a full face blot at least 4 times a day
this product worked to help control the shine for maybe an hour
although when i wore it during the day
i wash my face at night
get on with the day
when he applies it after he washes his face it keeps oil at bay for only a couple hours if that
to use in the morning just wish it worked all day long
i wanted to use it before my morning make up
but... i woke up the next day with pimples!
it feels heavy through the entire day
am still using it every night before bed
tacky even hours after application
next time i'll test the dispenser before leaving the store
i used the face cream before bed
woke up the next morning with a terrible allergic reaction all over my entire face
a couple night a week something a little heavier to hydrate overnight
began using it on january
which is a peak on wintertime
i stopped using it in the morning
only using it at night
there at the end of the day
the next morning my face felt dull and dry.
in the meantime i'll keep using this at night
just recently move somewhere that actually gets cold during winter
my skin is all oily in the afternoon around 3pm
i put it on around 9 or 10am
tried it out last night
on to the next one to try
while it was ok to use for the first time
if i put it on at night i wake up looking like i've been crying all night
i took a pic every monday for 6 weeks
if anything the morning after use
see pictures below- day one
i used this morning
night non-stop for over a month
used it once at night
the next morning i had three giant whiteheads in the area that i applied it
have to wait for 10 minutes before i put on my pants
i used every day for a leng time
if you use it in the morning you need atleast 30 minutes for the product to dry prior to make up
in the evenings you need the same amount of time to dry before continuing with lotion or trying to sleep
i noticed even with an hour of dry time the product would still stick to my pillow
because after about 2 nights i started to break out
probably only at night/makeup free days
uncomfortable throughout the day
i put in on my face last night.
when i woke up in the morning
applying it every other night
my skin was on fire the morning after
i am going to go back to every other night
i applied it nightly
especially in the winter
i may continue to use as a spot treatment of sorts on my chin at night
with day and night application.
i am only using once a day
or as a night cream
every time i used it
waiting 5-10 minutes to apply my foundation
i tried this last night
when i woke up
i'll try it overnight for the next few nights
after 2 weeks of daily am/pm use
the product will be returned very shortly
i am on the hunt this year for a great eye product
redness in the mornings so switched to every other day for a little while
i gave this a try for 30 day
i used this in the am
it kind of has a dry feeling about an hour after you put it on
so i'll keep using it till it's finish.
one at night- one during the day
within 24hrs each time it was the same thing.
i put this on every day in the morning
i used it in the morning and before bed.
e the change to this or the night cream i was using at the time
i think it was the night cream.
am about to finish the container
i found it worked better at night
at night after applying this eye cream
once in the morning
didn't use it until today
i brought this with me for my summer vacation to southern china where the temperature was around 30-34c
t's best used at night
just testing it on the back of your h
i wore this as an overnight treatment for dry h
when i used this eye cream overnight
i used it both day and night as instructed.
by the second day
it didn't go away until about a day later :(
today it's the one month i am using this eye cream every morning
i used this everyday for a week
it really does stay on top of the skin all night
if it didn't come in my 10 days of clinique set
i prefer origins night a mins as my night cream.
every night i wear this
i wake up next morning
on the nights that i do apply
oil the morning after use
the next morning my face felt exactly the same.
after 20 nights of continuous application i'm giving up on this product
i tried it overnight
the next morning my skin felt no different
supple my face would feel in the morning after applying this the night before
as i was smoothing it on my face after my normal nightly routine
the next morning i woke to find my skin slightly tighter
i go to the beach every summer
i did have late-onset acne starting at age 17 untill recently at about age 25
i put it on hours before bed
my skin was still sticky in the morning
i went straight to return this product the next day
i still felt greasy when i woke up after using this at night before bed
i put on before i went to bed
woke up maybe three hours later
wear this at night instead of this supercharge.
it lingered on my skin for hours
because it takes hours
when i tried it again the second night
this night cream feel nice upon application.
the same thing happened the next day
after about a week of daily use along with my normal moisturizer
i would still wake up the next day with oily t-zone
applied it the next morning within an hour i had an oil slick on my face
my skin still peeling off the next day morning
my face stayed sticky for hours after i applied it
in the morning under my primer
leave this at the store!
i tried this serum for 3 days & nights.
i only use it at night.
it's great as a morning wash
i tried wearing this in the daytime
it’s probably a good cream to wear at night time
a half in the evening
need to wash my face mid-day
i weekly use the rose face mask since i love the product so much
i occasionally use this product in the morning to cleanse my face
will remain in the day time
i apply this oil at night
when i wash my face at night
or if i sweat during the day
i also woke up with a pimple the first day after using it
i applied it about an hour before bed
where shall i start
even though i only applied it at night
s for the winter
only to be used at night.
by the 3rd night
i broke out again after a few nights
when you put it on at night
it's hard to even open your eyes in the morning
when you put it on during the day
i'll finish the bottle for night use
as it is so oily from the moment i put it on at night to when i wake up in the morning-- even though i use a very tiny amount of product on my eyes
i usually used it at night only
i notice a glow the day after input it on before bedtime
by the second night, i was orange.
as the day went on
it said day or night use
i put it on before bed
the smell when i wore it this morning
i decided to try it out again this evening--i've had it on for a few hours
told me all about it yesterday when we were at sephora
using it both morning
not help my makeup last through the day
while it did provide a satin finish for a few hours
by late afternoon i appeared to look shiney with no sign of any of my foundation
since i try not to spend much time on my morning routine
i don't have an extra 5 minutes in the morning to use something that should take 30 seconds
blotting a couple a times an hour
i woke up the same i always wake up.
i think i'll keep trying it for another 2 nights.
i will use it till the end
i wish i had purchased something a little more heavy duty for my night time regimen
would put it on before bed
i almost dread using it every night because the scent is so off putting
the day after i will break out
my face burns for the first 5 minutes every time
when i put this on at night i do not wake up with glowy
i do wake up with soft skin in the morning when i do use this
i woke up the next morning to red
at least on my skin
it continued until i decided to take this out of my routine
this was the only new thing to my night-time regime
even after a full week of skiing
my skin would be alright in the morning
i started using this in the winter at the suggestion of a sales person at the clarins counter
great for night before bed.
for your generous return policy this is going back tomorrow
i may try it again in the summer time
too heavy for me as a day/ night cream.
when i used it at night i woke up
tends to remain on the surface even in the morning after the application in the evening
woke up the next day with 4 new pimples.
i got very oily later in the day
humid part of the country
would irritate my eyes within an hour of application
i used it yesterday morning
this layer last from morning till afternoon
after a while, i shine through it.
maybe because i used it in my late 20s?
used every morning and night.
as for evening out skin tone
the effects wore off by the next day
when i woke up the morning after the last application of the mask
i applied it every other day
after about a week i started noticing my skin feeling really dry later in the day
i plan on returning it.
a little rough for every day
get on with my routine
i used it in the morning because it is really gentle
after using it last night a fab pad still had makeup on it
even 20 minutes after i put it on i can still smell it on me
le whether it be day or night that i'm using this
does not like the smell of it at all when i put it on before bed
after leaving it on for not even an hour
every time i used it
the next morning i woke up with under the surface bumps
the greasiness subsided by the time i woke up in the morning
i looked refresh and i only used it 3 times.
once i cover it up with a night renewal cream
refresh my eyes after working constant night shifts
i gave it a try for a full week.
it's good for mantaing a glow during the day.
i didn't expect resolution overnight
i used it at night before my night cream for a week
i apply right after i cleanse my face at night.
i used the last half of mine up tonight
7 oz over 3 months every night after cleansing
i put it on at night only for one week.
the first night i used it
my skin felt so great the next morning
firmness in the first week
after the 3rd week when i was doing my make up
during mid day, i feel dry on my cheeks.
weekly masks since like forever
night like it says on the directions
i keep using it till now
one morning i woke up with my eyes so red
i kept trying to use it every night
i used it for a couple of nights.
use the origins ginzing refreshing eye cream on the mornings where i didn't have much of a good nights rest
my eyes puffed up for the 48 hours following application
went back to sisley for night time
i believe i get best results when i take a hot shower at night
when i am considering the second one
i would put this on in the morning
then my dry skin would flake up again just a few hours later
put it on b4 bed with my night time routine
then i find that my face is a little on the dry side around 4 hours in
'd apply in the morning
then face would be dry around lunch
same results on the face
tried it out this morning in place of a moisturizer
'll just give it sometime until my face was almost full of blemishes
used the cream again last night
i will continue to use it as a refresher for trips or to keep in my purse after workouts
s i did before
i decided to try it again last night
it was at night
12 hours later you still feel it on your face
by the end of the day or when i wake up i'm feeling dry again
i would only recommend to use it at night
i put it on in the morning
2 hours later i found my eye area became very dry
i put it on before i go to bed
i noticed after a full week of using this that my fine lines
by noon i'm counting down the hours until i can leave work
there as i kept on using it day
my skin is dry by the end of the day.
i would have to blot within an hour of using this
am going to try just using the softening concentrate at night instead
this left my combo skin shiny by lunch time
it on for about 5 minutes before i had to wash it off
it kept me awake at night because that's i could smell
at the end of the day
i used this product every day
sting every time i use it
i woke up in the morning broken out
i don't know who has time to use this product on a weeknight
assuming this was a detox period or something
tomorrow morning i'm going to try the eve morning cleanser
nose within 6 days of nightly use
at the time it was
make sure you really massage it in for the two minutes before washing it off
i massage it in before my morning shower
i am a fan of eve lom night time cleansing balm
for me it was just too much first thing in the morning
i just used it in the morning
i took it on a 5 day trip
not for me i am returning this cream.
this night cream virtually did nothing at all for me
where do i begin
'll come back at the end of the month
then the night cream
i used this every night before bed.
i only used it at night for about a week
after that, i tried using it only at night.
this product balls up like there is no tomorrow
apply it first thing in the morning a while before applying makeup
decided to start using it in the am too
each time i'd run my h
the night i got it
i will say that when i woke up the next day i noticed softer smoother skin
i tried it 4 nights in a row
on the last night i hated it so much i wanted to wash it off
this night cream was the one i used the most.
this a heavier night cream than i am used to using on my face
it's too soon to confirm the worth of this night cream
use it as a last step before bed
i live in a very hot area in the inl
i even leave a light layer on overnight once in a while
as an overnight mask
which i do after my nighttime routine
left it on overnight once
can basically just spend my entire morning
i only use it at nighttime
end up greasy bc i am using more than two drops each time
i put it on at night
i put it on again this morning
i used this nightly for a month
don't like using this in the mornings
within 24 hrs i could tell i felt dryer than usual
used it that night
24 hours later my skin was peeling off my face
tried to use it every other day at night
that feeling wears off after about an hour
i put it at night
time on my skin care routine
great morning or night.
it last on me for about 5-6 hours which is okay.
even as a night cream
after an hour or so
it was still very oily on me hours after i applied it
this might be good to use at night as a sleeping mask
perfect for the cold season
this product made my skin very dry after using it for two nights
i've used this faithfully every night
my eyes tear for hours after application
after a week or so of torture i gave up
its going on my third week im using it twice a day
now just use it at night to get rid of it
the next morning the area around my eyes still feels dry
would clean it n when i went to use it again it had another clump the next morning
i dread using it again the next morning.
when i put it on during the day
unless it's late in the day
in fact shortly after starting the product
woke up with an oily face if i used it as a night cream
'd wake up oily every morning
i used this to take off my eye make up this morning
better for a morning wash than a night one
i applied a tiny amount on my face on the first night
i used it again on the second night
rritated on the next morning
then about an hour/hour
decided to try it on followed by regret in the morning
i didn't like the feel at night
it was sticky the entire night.
this is literally not an overnight mask
there is nothing remaining on my face in the morning
does dry quickly to stay on all night
one day i will find my match
i only use at night
break out just two nights of using it
use eye cream on a daily basis -- morning
the first day i used it
this is my 3rd time tonight i have it on
i used it once, yesterday.
about an hour after putting on foundation
the next day my skin was so dry
at the same time
didn't leave me with a weird residue in the morning which was great
i used it in the evening only
instead of applying every morning
i tried to reduce it to every other day at night
i first tried the 10 day trial
i am going to return this.
left it on for 20 minutes
i returned it the next day.
even the next morning my skin looked the same.
i am going to return
at the same time
left it on for 10 minutes
after an uncomfortable 40 minutes waiting for all of it to dry
my skin felt super soft for the first hour after washing my face with it
not so good at night
i can only use this cleanser at night because if i use it in the am
throughout the day my face was still oily
its came in time for the summer heat
used it again in the shower the next morning
after a few hours it starts to peel off bit by bit
gave it a day rest
my skin improved until i put it on the next night
try to apply it an hour or so before bed to avoid residue on the pillow
evening of skin tone is also not there
am going to pick up again in the spring/summer to see if it works better then
after wearing it every night for a week
every time i put it on
the results in the morning are fantastic.
i immediately stop using the mask at night
every time i put it on i have to st
i will continue to use twice a day
now i tried it for a week both in the morning
therefore tried this before bed one night
i typically read for a while before falling asleep
this was before i was supposed to leave for the day so my eyes burned at work
couldn't wear it during the day
applied it after cleansing my face at the end of the day
will be returning today.
even after washing my face well that night i woke up with more acne than i've seen on my face in years
my skin was soft the next day
make sure you wash your face very well at night or you'll break out in the morning
i put it on at night
luckily i had applied it at night as it was way too visible on me to have worn outside in the daytime
i tried this for the first time last night
my face was an oily mess for 2 hours before i just had to take it off
for a few weeks i used it at night instead of my regular moisturizer
i'll be returning it tomorrow.
when i looked in the mirror an hour after applying it
i used it as an overnight treatment
i used this overnight as per the instructions
used overnight as a hydrating mask on monday
particularly during the winter
i tried it out the night i received it
also my pores looked larger in the morning after using it every time
i tried it morning/night/after clarisonic/after scrub
once it's on the face for 5 minutes
flakes off about a minute after i put it on
i would have to scrub it off with a cleanser at the end of a day at the beach to get it off
after using it at home
i gave it a try a week
by my second day of use
i ended up returning it the next day.
only blurred them for the first hour it was on
ordered it the minute it was released on sephora's website
at least with my skin
wears off throughout my workday
and make my face look shiny after 6 or so hours.
by the end of the day
upon allowing blur to dry for the specified 1 minute i didnt notice any difference in results that my normal morning or evening facial routines provide
i applied in the morning after washing my face
after an hour of application
am still getting daily coverage
only use this in the night time
on the first day of use it barely kept my face moisturized 'til noon
i am constantly on the go
the tube was in my makup bag for one day
after wearing it all day
s or going to the gym
this went back the next day.
follow with the rest of my nightly face routine
leave it on all night
you wash it off the next morning
t's easy to sleep with it on
however the next morning
then my face was super itchy for the next hour or so
was excited to use it as a overnight mask
i leave it on about 15 minutes before rinsing off
then i began leaving it on overnight like the directions recommend
i will return this item tomorrow.
at night with my clarisonic
i tried it morning or night or in the shower
when i used this in the morning
i went about my morning around the house
by the end of the day i could not wait to wash it off
it will last through the day
am careful to wear it when i spend time outside
5 minutes after applying this i was red
it says "wake up call
it will wake you up
it took a few hours for my face to stop burning
gave me a terrible headache for 10 hrs.
i wake up in the morning very early
i usually wake up with a few dry patches depending on how much effort i place into my routine at night
every night i apply this oil instead of my josie maran
pray i won't wake up with a new pimple
every morning when i excitedly run to the mirror
also i got very oily during the day.
dry at the same time
it will sit on top of your skin for ages
really enjoyed using it as a night eye cream
as the day passes
i ended up washing it off in the middle of the night
i would recommend only using at night.
before on the trip it wasn't that bad or good
i used it at night
we've all had those nights where we're exhausted
applying on dark spots twice a day
i did the mask at night
immediately when you place the day cream underneath the eye it brightens it up almost immediately
i considered tossing the night cream in the trash after trying the day cream
i didnt at first realize it was night
i used the night cream pack first
by the time i woke up in the morning the skin under my eyes was dehydrated
applied the am portion one day
at night when washing my face
i started with the nighttime portion
the next morning i applied the daytime portion
it was strange because i had no reaction at all the night before
i am hooked on the night cream after a sample--wow
used it after cleansing at night
i brokeout like crazy the next day
decided to try it out last night
i woke up this morning
i broke out the next morning after use
i left the treatment on my face for 5 minutes
i accidentally left it open one night to find it dry the next morning
however when used overnight i notice less puff in the mornings
it's a game i like to play when i use this at night
would not recommend trying to put makeup over this in the morning
this was said to be used at night.
within an hour an especially in the morning the skin around your eyes are sticking together in spots
i put this on my eyes in the evening
when i woke up in the morning
i returned it after much anticipation
i ended up using it only by night.
my only problem with this was that when i would put it on at night it was sticky
when i woke up in the morning they seemed more noticeable
i only used it at night
when i wake up in the morning
i put this on before bed
when i wake up in the morning
this morning i've had to scrub at my under eyes to get it off
was peeling the next day
i returned mine the next day.
i am over 60 and maybe its just too late !!!
this won't work for the day
i will actually be returning this tomorrow.
i sleep 8 hrs and drink plenty of water.
i did it and am to try again tonight.
even after waking up in the morning
which say to apply morning
why wear it to bed when it gives an instant lift?
i think i started to see some evening out of my skin tone
i am in my early 30s
i apply it before going to bed.
i did like how my skin felt the next morning though
better as night cream
it stays all night
it is wayyyyyy too perfumed to be recommended for nighttime/before bed use
used it religiously morning
i used it basically every day
1 pump every morning for 1 month
i used this faithfully every morning
se how your skin reacts on the next two days
i brought the kit with me for a 5 day trip
i am back home now
puffy the next morning
i just use it at night before i sleep now.
when i use this in am
next morning i went to put on makeup
go out in the sun
gave it a try this evening
i used it just before bed
i used this everyday in my morning skin care routine
will be going back to the lancôme night cream i was using before
i used this every night until i was literally down to my last drop
i always go through a skincare routine before i go to bed
night after the brightening infusion
when i am going out
the next day i was amazed
it returned to dullness after a week
i took this with me during a trip
like on it's own or at different times of day
roll it all off before you begin
my skin felt fine throughout the day
when i got home at the end of the day
it made my skin look pretty the first few nights i used it
had to wash off about 3 hours later because the smell never goes away
going back to the store today.
it's an oil at the beginning
it's only on my face for a minute or so
however one morning after a week of putting this on day/night my mother asked if i was stoned -- baffled
im in the early stage of fine lines
i put it on each night
i put moisturizer on afterwards at night
i still had to use my normal face wash after.
that in the end all this does is just break up the make up in preparation for a cleanser
used it for the first time this morning to wash my face
one morning i woke up with a little rednees
at the end of the day
in a matter of hours, the gel aged me.
every morning and sometimes at night.
i am almost done with my second round of this serum
after the time i apply the product on my skin
next day after i watch my face
i used it for overnight in the beginning
guess for my skin type maybe just leave it on for at most 1 hour
'd do my normal night time skin care routine
the next morning i was extremely shiny
it remains sticky clear into the next morning after applying
does not feel hydrating at all when i put it on at night
i only like the fresh sensation at the beginning
after using some other overnight masks
especially during the winter
i put it on at night
i will be returning this cream.
i used this with my clarisonic at night
use it in my morning shower when i don't have eye makeup on
once in the morning
it felt like i was putting water on my face morning
i noticed a lengthy breakout session
normal again seconds after application
which is preferred in the morning before makeup
i used it every night for about 2 months until i finished the jar
especially in the winter time
i used it as a sleep in treatment
i noticed a lengthy breakout session
normal again seconds after application
which is preferred in the morning before makeup
i am almost all out
i live in a place that is fairly cool year round
i will update this as time goes by
i tried it at night
the next morning i woke up with 2 huge blemishes
does a temporary lift if you need it for around three hours
use that in the morning
putting this on at night didn't give me any results in the morning
putting this on in the morning i saw firmer skin for a couple of hours
reapply my night cream again
i am halfway through the bottle
substitute for face wash in the morning
not a good base for makeup in the morning.
tried them out applying once in the morning
have made sure to wash my face morning
in fact it felt worse in the morning then normal.
used it about 4 nights in a row
this time tried using it every other night which worked
this night cream every other night
to leaving a film on my face all night?
for me, this just sits on my skin overnight.
after the first night i was unimpressed
it sat on top of my skin without soaking in the entire night
i would woke up every morning withe the pores super big
will keep up as a nightly regime
when i woke up this morning
especially when i was sleeping
when i woke up in the morning
the first night i used it, it was fine.
in the morning i had dry patches.
i woke up in the morning looking refreshed
to the point where i didn't want to lay my face on my pillow at night
sometimes i looked alright in the morning
unfortunately the next morning i woke up with the biggest breakout i have ever experienced
skin felt tighter next morning
i too had a whitehead next day
messy when u put in on before bed
the first night, it seemed great.
the following nights, not so much.
still on the hunt to find the perfect night cream
i first heard about this product from the fresh rep at sephora one day
i need an overnight mask"
i also had a really hard time sleeping with it on
when i went to wash my face in the morning
about the 4th time i used this product
i've had the same reaction to another overnight mask
when i wake up
wash my face in the morning my face is drier than i've had it before
i switched back to my regular night cream for a bit to find out whether it was the mask or the winter season that was making my skin drier
used it day and night.
i used this around my eyes at night before bed
i used this twice a day for a good month before throwing in the towel
i am returning this purchase from late april.
i noticed that as i continued to use this each day
i keep it in the shower
i am in my early 20s
i didn't make a connection to the product use until the second day
my face was so dry within an hour of use
t's a good product for mornings
so two stars bc it did make my face feel amazing for the first two nights i used
it makes my face feels supper dry even in summer.
i also had just started a new bc pill at about the same time
the next morning i put this on under my benefit porefessional along with face makeup
i'll be skipping this one the next time i need an eye cream
burning for hours until i washed the creme off
i used it last night
then i remembered using this the night before
i am returning this for sure.
after cleansing at night
every time i used it
when i woke up the next morning i had little red pimples everywhere
made sure to double cleanse every night
when i use it at night
wake up then next morning it's still sitting on my face
i may try it as a moisturizer alone tomorrow night
each time i used this i woke up super oily
using it every night
the only upside is that my skin felt smoother in the morning after applying it before bedtime
there's almost no difference in my skin after using it religiously every night
i gave it 2 weeks of nightly use only to wake up every morning with a new breakout
i did not see any change in my skin when i woke up the next day
it's too late to return
instead of using this on a regular basis i'm going to give a semi-regular basis a whirl
immediately tested it out that night
i used for 2 nights
every time i used it
i tried the next day to wash my face with it
i'll continue to use it for de-puffing after sleepless nights of writing papers until i find an all-in-one cream that i like better
or for tired morning eyes
in the mornings and it did nothing.
all though i have not had a sleep-deprived night since i've purchased
i'd like to see how this item works after a long sleepless night
girls in there early 20's
i tried it for the first time this evening
so, i tried it again the next night.
i am going to finish the bottle
stopped applying it every night
after using this morning
always put my night cream over
i usually leave my mask on for 1hour or more.
i recommended leaving it on for less than an hour like i did
i would recommend this mask 2-3 times a week instead of every day use
i started using this mask exactly one month before my wedding hoping that it would give me that wedding day glow
smooth after sleeping in it
would have used it before a shower
made me breakout next day
i left it on for 30 minutes
after i use it
the redness was gone when i woke up the next day
face bright red for a couple hours after.
i sat there for about an hour
left it on for 10 minutes
after 5 minutes of it on my face
to leave this on my face for about 5 minutes
i used it every morning
am starting to get fine lines
woke up the next morning with my face bright pink
wish i hadn't bought the full bottle after only one night of use
on to the next cream
i plan on returning it tomorrow.
seriously the next day
must return it on the weekend
i apply every morning
i decided to only use it for nighttime instead of day
after a week of using this my face is flakey
on the 3rd day
i looked like i had had a good nights sleep!
used it the next morning
after using it at night i woke the next day with small bumps all over my face
i wouldn't spring for this one
this is the 4th day
after about an hour or two it starts to pill into little balls all on its own
until i use it up
used it only at night
what's worth is that the next morning my eyes were red
the same thing happens in the morning when i use this cream at night
i found this cream good for a week
started using this as a night moisturizer when i ran out of pm moisture
i tried to put on the milk without the oil tonight
i tried to apply it the second night
used once at night.
my face this morning was the exact definition of that condition
afternoon for about 2 days before my face was absolutely covered in acne
the next day was the worst
a hour later my face started to feel weird
i tried it again the next day, the same results.
the next morning i had the worst breakouts
at night i followed it with my usual origins night-a-mins night cream
i used this morning and night for 6 weeks.
a trip to the emergency room
i would still recommend it for oily skin types for at night just not during the day
use it only at night
plus suggested use saying its for day/night
the first day i used this
the second day i used it, it was awful.
scary feeling that i returned it on sunday after receiving it on friday
i wake up super early
need some brightening by mid week to help me look fake awake
can only be used at night
with the winter weather though
was surprised when every morning i would wake up with greasy skin
third, i swear i breath it in every time!!
since the directions say to use morning
i went back to my regular routine
drying at the same time
i ended up purchasing the ole henriksen invigorating night treatment
i saw the results the next day
i saw a difference in my skin the next morning
tried it during the day
tried it at night
i couldn't wait to wash it off at the end of the day
stays that way all day/night until it is washed off
if you put on lotion on in the morning like i do
help keep my foundation in place where it will normally break up after a few hours
my skin felt okay for the first hour or two
this will be returned.
when i rinse my face in the morning
i used this nightly until about half the jar was gone
i put some on on during the day
feel of the cream which i use nightly
i apply it before bed
when i do use it i wake up in the morning
when i use this for day
when i woke up after sleeping
every time i used it
i used it a night before going to bed.
the night oil just didn't perform
i grew tired of being patient with this product as i was waking every morning after having slept with this product on my face all night
i've used this oil every single night since november until now
but call it what it is...a night oil serum.
i moved on to using it every other day
letting it sit for 30 minutes before i apply the powder
used it immediately the first night
continued to use it for a few nights until one morning i woke up with a huge blemish
any day i wore this
i noticed breakouts in the evening after washing my face
it also caused my makeup to come off within 3-4 hours
this stuff kept my make-up on from 7am until 7pm.
i could still smell it while i was trying to fall asleep
it immediately begins to pill
i didnt like this at all when i put it on
by midday it is pilling up
i got oily after like only 2 hrs.
it only takes an hour after applying this cream for my face to be drenching in oil
when i wore this i was looking greasy at the end of the day
i can stay matte for an hour at most with this
after an hour, my t-zone was shiny.
doesn't reduce oil-just as oily by noon.
my face looks the same at the end of the day if i apply it
won't slide off as the day goes on
hours later you're oily again
it happens shortly after i use it
even at night on a clean face with no foundation over it
shiny after a couple of hours especially in the t-zone
after a day of work at my desk job
i still get very oily after about 5 hours.
apply it twice daily
pill up throughout the day
it lasts maybe one hour before i have to blot
i've used it in the day for not in the summer it's to heavy for that for me personally where i live summers are usual 89-101 degrees daily
in the winter i would use night
i would say to only use this every other day or once a week not nightly
even when i used it before bed.
once i started using it daily my skin sort of felt sticky for a couple hours after
i love it, but only as a night cream.
it would be best only at night.
winds up taking more effort than i want to at the end of the day
i found that i was more oily at the end of the day
by the end of the day
my skin was an oil slick after a couple hours
i didn't like the way this felt on my face during the day
however when i used it at night
my face felt really soft the next morning
by the end of the day
i wore it night
i didn't realize till i was home that it was a gel
i am in my mid-20s with good skin.
when i put on this product over night
i finished the whole bottle of this night cream
eyeshadow has no chance of staying put longer than an hour
i don't mind this at night
use it morning and night.
didn't notice a big difference in the dryness of my under eye once morning came when using it overnight
is ok for night use
after about half an hour my skin feels really irritated
with no spf i can't see using this during the day
i tried it one night
after about 3 days of using it am/pm it made my skin unbearably dry
used this one one night
i did this for several nights just to make sure
another time after i did my normal morning routine
after being in the sun
wearing this product every day
i tend to only put this on at night before bed or under my foundation
will keep using this till its gone
i used it for the first time yesterday morning
this morning i woke up with at least 4 of them!
i would day i'm normal
it itched for hours
after a week of using this every morning
i woke up this morning with tightness
i used this as my sunscreen during a week at the beach
it is definitely a go to for the beach or outdoor activities where i will be in the sun all day
for a good hour after applying
before buying it i checked at the reviews
its near impossible to let it sit on your skin for longer then a minute or two before it starts to drip
left on for 3 minutes
my skin would be glowing in the morning
will pill later in the day.
unfortunately i'm sticking to nights only
i am still using it at night
when i put this cream on after applying the treatment
when i woke up in the morning
it flakes like no tomorrow
it remains on your face for the rest of the day
decided to use it one day
i tried it three times as a leave on mask overnight
i returned it the next day.
tonight, i tried a double foundation.
that night was the perfect time to try this out
i could see myself using it on a relaxed morning
i am 48 with dry
you should wait 10-15 minutes for it to dry before putting on makeup
however i am nearly 3/4 of the way through
i felt like i had to wait for hours to even put on make up
i just used it in the shower
maybe i'll try it again in the summer?
the smell stuck around for at least an hour.
my face was sticky the entire day.
after about an hour my face
after i put it on my face at home
it was because i put this on in the morning
i used it today alone
perfect for morning to wake up
you didn't get a great nights sleep
i left it on my skin for about 45 minutes
for now i am returning this product
it makes my face red every time after i use it
this is my second time using the same pack
if i put it in the morning
i just use it at night now in addition to another eye cream
i didn't sleep in this mask
i took a small 20 minute nap with it on
gross that after an hour of trying to fall asleep not sticking to my pillow
when i woke up my skin did feel refreshed for the first few nights
also after following up with my regular morning routine of toning/makeup
which means no mess on my pillow at night
it was the holiday season
i don't need this year round
if i apply this in the morning
my t-zone got oily within a couple hours
i start to look shiny again only after 2 hours or so
i wear it for ong hours at a time
my eyes just gotten more puffy than before when i woke up each morning
the estee night repair eye serum in miles ahead of this product
i'll still use it once a week for a pick me up.
no long term evening of skin tone
it was a new routine
it was too thick for me good for a night time routine
it leaves me very red for the next 36-48 hours
i woke up this morning
the closest sephora store to me is an hour drive
this one is very good: i can use it either at night or in the morning
not the next morning
tried it at night
the first time i put it on
you can leave it on over night
i felt dry during the day
if i use it at night
i also got the night formula
i applied this product at night before bed because it bled so much into my eyes that i couldn't wear it during the day
s stayed sticky for hours after applying this stuff
unclean for hours afterwards
i used this product for 2 nights
i used this both morning and night.
at night, i would use this as my final step.
halfway through the day
when it was applied as directed at night
i started using it nightly
every time i go into sephora
around the eye all day long
super annoying when you notice it at work mid-morning
i finished the jar using it as a night cream
however must be daytime for non make up wearing ladies
by the end of afternoon
ever since i have started using this eye cream at night
i when back to using the serum at night
i am hoping i start to see results soon.
i am in my early 30s
wear make-up for up to 12 hours
i put it on as a night cream for two nights in a row
on the second night i woke up two three zits on my face
i tried it for two nights
both nights my hair around my face was oily when i woke up
will try it again in the shower sometime.
i used this hoping to find my skin flawless the next day
by the next morning
used the remainder on my eye area
even after an hour it is still sticky on my face.
after reading the reviews on this one
i used it twice daily and quickly saw results.
i first used it at night
i then tried it in the morning under my makeup
it was on the same day
when i wore it at night, i woke up a greaseball.
i am fifty and on dry side.
i'll keep using it til the very end of course
loved it up until the last time i ordered
i dreaded applying it every day
i wore this to bed last night
so while touching my skin a couple hours later to check its lasting hydrating benefits
with only 1 night of wearing it
i used it in the morning after rinsing my face.
i only use this as a last ditch effort if my skin feels dry in the morning
due to recent humid weather
i tried some of it before bedtime just to see how it worked
it didn't absorb into my skin at all after a couple of hours
use it only at night
the first two days i wore it i didn't wear
excitedly applied it the next day before my makeup
i am super oily before lunchtime even arrives.
used it before bed
i applied this cream before i went to bed
i woke up the next morning
using it before bedtime
still super sticky hours after use.
i am going to return it
in the beginning every other day
and plus too late and used up to return
then i didn't use for the weekend
use 1-2 drops and only during the day.
couldn't wait for it to arrive
hopefully it would arrive blue
returned it the same day
at the time it wasn't held at sephora
the next morning i was still broken out
i get a minimum of 7 hours of sleep
i've started to alternate using this with an eve lom eye product to address my fatigued eyes
i used it every night
while i like the day cream
used it every day
i am going to return.
i've put it on an hour before bed before
i'll use it until the mini runs out
by the end of the day
every time i used it
i'd try this in the morning
still use it in the morning under bb cream with sun protection
i used it morning
who wants to have to use a mask every night vs once or twice a week?
i am going to return this product!
i will keep using it until i finish it
adding a good five minutes to my face care routine
i protect my skin during the day
am rarely outside in the sun
woke up the next morning with red bumps all in the area i put it in
would irritate my eyes hours after application
the first time i put it on
i barely had any sun damage until last summer
i will finish the bottle then update this review
i am going to try returning it.
i tried it the next day
oily in summer/fall
i didn't think it was the cleanser at first until i used it again
once in the morning
the third day i went to go wash my face at night it felt rough
fast forward to the next morning
hoping my origins night balm will correct this soon
i used this in the morning
i tried it in the evening again
i've never had this before in my life so the next morning i went to the dermatologist
being in my late 20s
at least as of late
the first week i started to use it all it did was leave dry patches on my skin
i used before bed
i will try it again in the pm
after a couple of evenings of continuous use
waited a week until my skin went back to normal
after i use it
got this in the "sleep" box.
i got this in the sephora sleep kit
i would try to use this product on nights when i had a little more time
alternating every other night with another product
after an hour or two of just being in my house my t-zone started to get oily
let work for a minute or two before rinsing
