the price for this moisturizer is steep
just a typical lotion or primer
don't bother, other creams are better.
thjs has got to be the worst moisturizer i have used
so thought this lotion would be equally as divine
this moisturizer was too much for me
cream i went for this cream
i feel like exfoliating ones might be better
i find the serum too light for a night moisturizer
especially this serum once i apply moisturizer over it
this is more like a gel moisturizer -- nice
when i like lighter serums anyway
disappointing i didnt see any difference with using this with a moisturizer
this moisturizer may be good for people who have oily or combination skin
i used a sample as an overnight moisturizer
it is a good moisturizer
this used to be my go to eye cream
i believe they showed me a moisturizer.
you would be better off just using your regular moisturizer as an eye cream rather than buying this
this eye cream from clinique is okay.
i like this cream.
this product only moisturizers, not much else.
some eye creams the price makes you cry.
whenever i apply my tarte shapetape concealer after i apply the eye cream
seems to moisturize but not much else.
i felt like this moisturizer
helped my concealer go on smoother
i think it is a fairly good moisturizer though.
i always let it dry before i applied moisturizer
i like this thin consistency that works well under concealer
the best i can say is its a passable moisturizer for under my concealer
it saves me using up my $55 moisturizer
you might wni regularly use clinique eye cream
it is a decent eye cream for everyday use
this sunscreen was way toooo thick
it's not even high enough spf to keep it as a sunscreen
i appreciate other murad products like the oil-free sunscreen
'tis a shame since i was interested in this nourishing blend of sunscreen for winter-spring
it is the first ever moisturizer that made me break out
feels more likea lotion
i've used the perfecting day cream without spf
this sunscreen should come with a warning.
as a result i ended up layering this on top of other moisturizer
not too heavy with the added benefit of sunscreen
also wanted one with sunscreen
this moisturizer is very thick.
it also has the scent of sunscreen which i don't care for
basically, i've used better moisturizers.
i wanted something a little more emollient for winter
i also like that it has a little more sunscreen.
i love the night cream
this is the first time i've used the spf30 cream
this sunscreen is fine
i am contemplating buying a new moisturizer because of the smell
i found this moisturizer to be very greasy
a little bit richer than drugstore moisturizer
really wanted this to be the end of my search for a moisturizer
a little heavier than lotion
lighter than most night creams
my concealer is still creasing
it says to use it with the moisturizer a few mins after
does okay with light foundation/tinted moisturizer
t skincare products so was a little disappointed
what are you supposed to do about moisturizer?
what if i need a moisturizer?
get better results just using plain moisturizer.
i wasn't very impressed with this moisturizer.
i would not purchase this moisturizer.
as a moisturizer it's ok.
any daily moisturizer can help that if used vigantly enough
i originally wanted to try the 2 in 1 retinol night cream from this line
this falls short for me in regards to a retinol skincare product
i also don't see where this is exfoliating.
i think this is a great night time moisturizer
i love this moisturizer
it works better as a nighttime moisturizer.
for me, i'll stick to my usual moisturizer.
this moisturizer felt really nice on my skin
decided to try this instead of my usual josie maran moisturizer with spf
this is a nice, thick moisturizer.
the josie maran argan daily moisturizer spf 47
what the heck?back to first aid beauty ultra-hydration cream
like this moisturizer as it doesn't irritate my skin at all
'm slathering on a good moisturizer
it is a light moisturizer and i liked the feel.
maybe you can use it as a lotion
it is very expensive for being just a lotion
just rock my tan
my skin didn't look any more "glowy" than simply using moisturizer by itself
t might be a nice highlighter
i wanted to like this for the retinol
i love the old bare minerals skincare it honestly changed my skin
face cream for extra dry skin
don't rely on sunshine oil alone for moisturizing
it was an average moisturizer at best.
it's not a primer or a moisturizer.
it's like putting gel deodorant on your face
i could get the same amount of moisture from another moisturizer
it's not a moisturizer -- what is it?
if you need a moisturizer/hydrator there are far superior products out there
i loved this moisturizer when i first purchased
i will be looking elsewhere for a new day moisturizer
this was a great moisturizer til they changed the formula
this sunscreen is something that is supposed to be applied generously to the face
i wanted to love this moisturizer.
i want a moisturizer with sunscreen
i loved the feel of this moisturizer when applied
i started using the murad mattifying oil control moisturizer for my face instead
i hate that this moisturizer failed me.
the point is that i have much more affordable moisturizers with spf
oily skin so moisturizers have always scared me
when i saw they made lotion just for acne/oily skin i was sold
i didnt moisturize my or show any difference.
religiously used this lotion day
this moisturizer was ok.
it just wasn't the best moisturizer for me.
but i did like the texture of the lotion
it's just an average lotion.
the most i spent on lotion and was disappointed.
just a very light moisturizer.
i stopped using the lotion
i wouldn't say this is a miracle face lotion.
it is good if you want a lightweight moisturizer that moisturizes without making zits appear
only buy if you prefer using this as a night time moisturizer
this moisturizer is light
just average regular moisturizer!
i did like the sample of the moisturizing mask that came with it
tarte is now the baseline for all of my skincare needs
though it isn't quite a match for waterproof eyeliners or tubing mascaras
i wanted to love it because tarte's skincare is natural
i love their moisturizer
i fell in love with the moisturizer from this line
although it does work nicely as a cleanser i was hoping the scent would match the moisturizer
when i looked in the mirror to put moisturizer on
i only used the moisturizer under my eyes
the lightweight moisturizer makes it look oily so sad :
this moisturizer left my skin very sticky
this moisturizer left my face feeling sticky
like my daytime moisturizer to balance me out
this moisturizer is nice
the next day i used a different moisturizer altogether
i like my creams to be a little more runny
so this moisturizer works great under makeup.
tried this one because i enjoyed a moisturizer from this br
i even tried it under other moisturizer
concealer pills on top of it
the firming eye cream part is nice
i patted the product in then tapped my concealer
the product didn't work it just clumped the concealer
i tried it with 3 or 4 different concealers
if you wear concealer i wouldn't recommend
the box read it's a great moisturizer for 20-30 something skin
after 20 years of using the best moisturizer on the planet
this moisturizer is just ok.
which most moisturizers do
this is a good moisturizer it soaks right into the skin
the slap some tinted moisturizer on in the am
i recommend using this moisturizer at night only before bed
never had this issue with my foundation while using cream moisturizers
i want my moisturizer to actually moisturize me
this isn't good as a moisturizer
that it's a light weight moisturizer for the face
i love this moisturizer.
i don't think this is a bad moisturizer
it was definitely this moisturizer
i really wanted to love this moisturizer.
once i stopped using my previous moisturizer
wish i could love this moisturizer
it's the opposite of a moisturizer
gave this 1 star reason being that there are much better moisturizers with skin loving ingredients
moisturizer should be the least of my problems
this moisturizer is awful.
bad for removing mascara.
more than just a great moisturizer
i think this is a good moisturizer.
power essence is a decadent moisturizer that will leave your skin feeing dewy
the lotion does sting a little at first after application
this is definitely a good basic eye moisturizer.
works well as far as applying concealer over it
it's just a nice moisturizer
this is my first time using eye cream
i enjoy this eye cream.
doesn't allow concealer to apply or stay on in even consistency
no matter what concealer or setting powder i used :
this moisturizer is horrible under make-up.
this cream feels nice when applying
then applying concealer my concealer completely breaks up
this is okay for before putting on concealer because it feels light weight
just an everyday eye cream.
silky moisturizer that won't grease you up then this is a good choice
this product worked great as a moisturizer for me
it didn't make my skin feel moisturizer or rejuvenated
because i prefer lighter creams/serums during the day
or, you could try it with another moisturizer.
then layer moisturizers over it
this moisturizer is super thin.
with which i can get much more effective creams
i get more softness from my regular philosophy night cream or an argan product
the moisturizer itself is already very glittery
for people who would want to use tinted moisturizer to simplify their makeup routine
you cannot apply this as a moisturizing because it's too shiny
i actually skipped my bronzer
the cream highlighter was difficult to apply from the bottle directly
i used this as a highlighter along with contouring
i tried using a brush for the highlighter
i applied it one day as my moisturizer
i used this product as a moisturizer
despite this lotion being very sheer
only use a moisturizer with spf in the morning
i liked how it came with the lotion in the tube
i like mixing the lotion in with my foundation or bb cream
even though this moisturizer is advertised as lightweight
when i have a tan
aside from being a sunscreen
when i started to rub this moisturizer or put my makeup over it or a primer
this moisturizer is pretty thick
this moisturizer made me break out like crazy
great moisturizer over all i recommend to use this at night
this moisturizer is really nice
can't use it in the morning under sunscreen with my usual routine
there are a ton of available moisturizers that work amazingly
i would not call this cream "lightweight
it's an okay moisturizer
for a moisturizer this expensive
i tried this cream because i wanted a nice moisturizer for my face
very expensive for a moisturizer that is just ok.
it did not work under my laura mercier tinted moisturizer
i won't repurchase this moisturizer
i used other gel like moisturizer before
therefore i thought this moisturizer would be perfect for me
i still had to put a moisturizer over top of it
this would be a good light moisturizer for oily skin
you could get the same result from a $20 moisturizer
this is a really nice moisturizer
i like to use as an am moisturizer
applied twice a day before my moisturizer
this cream doesnt do much.
t is not the best moisturizer
not thrilled with this moisturizer.
i assumed this product was a moisturizer because of the name
ended up having to mix it in with my other moisturizer
then my daily moisturizer on top
it will not replace your daily moisturizer
this product doesn't do any moisturizing whatsoever
i try different moisturizers all of the time.
this moisturizer had a terrible effect on my skin
it was the perfect summer moisturizer for me
this moisturizer does the job for my combination skin
not because of the cream
will look into other daily moisturizers.
this seemed like the type of thing my skin should love -- moisturizing
i usually use jurlique night creams
it just seemed like any over-the-counter moisturizer
this moisturizer really did nothing for a skin.
it's not a bad moisturizer
really liked this moisturizer overall
you shouldn't be able to rub your own moisturizer off
wanted a gel-cream day time moisturizer
it was the only moisturizer that didn't make my skin break out
wide for a new moisturizer to love
this has been my holy grail moisturizer for the last 2 or 3 years
even with my normal moisturizer afterwards
use this over your concealer
which is the opposite of what you want in an eye cream/serum
my routine is to put on moisturizer
i've tried putting it on before my moisturizer
it doesn't matter if it's a moisturizer with or without a sunscreen
i did not put moisturizer on top as i am trying to find something to replace my moisturizer
followed by a new moisturizer
i can't tell if it's the serum or the moisturizer
you don't see it once you apply a moisturizer
i put a few drops on my beauty blender to blend out my concealer
the mascara...it was decent.
decided to buy it because i needed a moisturizer for my eyes
its maybe good for a moisturizer.
the mascara is subpar.
mascara was a throw in for about 50 cents
as for the mascara
the eyeliner is ok
it appears only waterproof liquid eyeliners work for me
the mascara is fantastic!
the mascara is what i was least excited about
it's easily one of the best mascara i've ever tried
no more so than any basic moisturizer
i do like this moisturizer
light moisturizer for my oily skin
this cream is not a water cream.
this moisturizer is great
product is a basic moisturizer with no special quality
this moisturizer is lackluster
i got this in a sephora skincare favorites box.
i feel like this moisturizer is just ok
honestly would be better as a primer than a moisturizer
my search for the perfect cream/gel moisturizer continues
except when i had just applied the moisturizer
this cream is a water based cream
middle of the road moisturizer.
moisturizer it doesn't do much for the skin.
i added a retinol to my nighttime routine which i love
still use the retinol i don't peel
the moisturizer itself is good, not great.
it just felt like a moisturizer
the moisturizer itself is not good at all
i usually buy the clarins gel moisturerizer for combination normal skin
it works well as a moisturizer
this moisturizer didn't work for me
the cream is very heavy
my skin does not appear or feel moisturized without using my usual moisturizers with it
i finally realized it was this moisturizer
i still feel my skin is super dry even by adding beauty oil into the moisturizer
it turned out to be just a regular moisturizer
this is a decent moisturizer but nothing special
i used as a moisturizer under my foundation.
as the day goes by my face gets oilier than when i use a regular moisturizer
my skin didn't feel moisturizer
this moisturizer leaves your skin feeling sticky
this is perhaps one of the worst moisturizers i have ever used
i will revisit this moisturizer come summer.
this moisturizer has set my skin back
this is the worst moisturizer.
prefer thick moisturizers so this didn't work out for me
i like this moisturizer very much
too much silicon feel for a moisturizer
it said use sparingly which i don't do with moisturizers
it didn't pack enough of a moisturizing punch for me
this would probably be great for someone with oily skin since it's a lightweight moisturizer
i find this moisturizer completely ineffective
it reminds me of a drink of water for the skin like a pre moisturizer or face mist
i need to put my other moisturizer on top
will use as a hand lotion at my desk.
felt dry as if i put no moisturizer?
then applied this moisturizer
i reapplied this moisturizer because my face felt like i hadn't applied a moisturizer at all
applied my usual moisturizer
moisturizer or origins than this
this moisturizer alone doesn't help at all on its own
there are better serums out there.
this is what i would call a "clear application" almost like a light moisturizer for your under eye
you can get a cheap drugstore moisturizer with jojoba if you wanted to for $8
setting spray don't seem to be doing anything when i wear this moisturizer
i never buy moisturizers
to use after my night time moisturizer
i even can't use this as a moisturizer
this moisturizer has a stronger fragrance than other algenist products i've used
you will need a moisturizer
this is in a container like lipstick/chap balm would be
don't expect miracles out of this because this little balm only slightly moisturizes
this moisturizer is just not doing the trick
it's not a good moisturizer.
it's definitely not a good moisturizer for very dry skin
the moisturizer isn't all that either.
just feels like im applying another moisturizer to my face
it might work as an occasional sunblock
it didn't moisturize my skin at all either
i put a separate moisturizer on top of it.
wanted to add an anti-aging moisturizer into my routine
always follow with moisturizer
i've tried layering with moisturizers on top
also tried with moisturizer underneath
i loved the concept of this all in one moisturizer
this seems like an okay choice for your skincare routine
it does help prime the face for my sunscreen/bb cream application
i tried it a few ways--blended with moisturizer
used it with my moisturizer
mixed with my moisturizer
mixing it with my moisturizer/foundation
pretty hefty price point for just a regular hydrating eye cream
my concealer doesn't sit well since the cream is moving around underneath
all it does it moisturize my under eyes
i am always on the lookout for a great moisturizer
it is a good moisturizer.
gave this moisturizer a try for 1 week
at first i didn't think it was this moisturizer
this moisturizer is mediocre and nothing special.
this moisturizer is definitely not worth the price
i just can't use creamy moisturizers like this- they all break me out
usually choose moisturizers very carefully
i also think it could be fine as a night moisturizer
had heard great things about this moisturizer
seems like a normal moisturizer to me
at first i thought this was a good moisturizer
the cream is a good, reliable moisturizer.
this moisturizer is too rich
once i switched moisturizers i didn't get those breakouts anymore
except for this moisturizer
the other from a moisturizer kit
i am still on the hunt for the perfect moisturizer
only had that greasy lotion feeling for about 30-45 seconds
i wanted to try out a moisturizer as i really like the pekee bar
which is so odd for a moisturizer
i won't purchase a moisturizer for $60.
this moisturizer didn't work for me.
it's a good moisturizer if you're not acne prone :
this moisturizer is just decent though.
i really did not like this lotion
this moisturizer feels amazing
this is just going to be a nighttime moisturizer
as much as i would like to rave about this moisturizer
it's back to finding a nearly non-existent moisturizer for me
i tried using it as a moisturizer/primer
it just feels like slathering a glittery bb cream on my face
or on top of a tan
this is a very glowy moisturizer that i could not wear alone
i prefer using highlighter to get there
is a very slightly highlighted moisturizer
i fell for the hype regarding glamglow illuminating moisturizer
when i think of a moisturizer
this moisturizer does give a nice glow
it really is an average moisturizer.
i would suggest getting the first aid beauty coconut priming moisturizer instead of this as 1: it is way cheaper 2: gives a nice glow 3: is way more moisturizing 4: also primes skin for makeup
i really love this moisturizer because i spray tan my body
i would say this is more of an esthetically pleasing moisturizer versus fixing dry skin
really doesn't substitute for a true facial "moisturizer" at least not for dry skin
this is different than other moisturizers
that it is a moisturizer
it did not moisturize my face at all.
couldn't apply any of my eye moisturizers nothing
this moisturizer doesn't work for me at all
this "moisturizer " made me feel like
as i am a big advocate of tinted moisturizer on the regular
i combined it with my bliss tinted moisturizer upon my second attempt
this moisturizer is jam-packed with glitter that instead emphasizes every nook
its also not that great of a moisturizer
layered it with my usual daily moisturizer
some undereye concealer my skin looked seriously glowy
it didn't have any spf which i like to have in an everyday moisturizer
each time i find myself reaching for another moisturizer
use it as a body moisturizer for a little glow
cons: the shimmer did not show through my concealer or setting powder
i just don't see a need for a moisturizer like this
the moisturizer isn't even that good.
putting this on as a moisturizer made my face look so shiny
i love the idea of a moisturizer/primer combo.
i still have to put another moisturizer on top
i can apply my concealer on with no problems
then i tried mixing it with moisturizer
you shouldn't exfoliate twice a day
you shouldn't even exfoliate everyday.
even the moisturizer does not help !!!!
the moisturizer feels beautiful on the skin
50 cheaper than the moisturizers i'm referring to
this is definitely not a lightweight moisturizer
probably best for dry skin or as a winter moisturizer
i don't mean spf in your foundation or tinted moisturizer
when i tried to place sunscreen on top of this moisturizer
not as a moisturizer if you have dry skin i recommend to use another cream
but i would not recommend this as a moisturizer.
i wouldn't recommend it more than other moisturizers
if i'm wearing a moisturizer during the day i only use spf
it was a very nice moisturizer
i like it as a morning moisturizer
you could probably get the same effect from a drug store moisturizer
i like the way the moisturizer feels on the skin.
good to put on after my moisturizer as a primer.
if i used another moisturizer with this
my makeup would look cakey
using it as both the moisturizer
you definitely need a moisturizer
definitely needs a moisturizer underneath
when i went to put on concealer with just this underneath
need moisturizer on top of this.
the moisturizer has a feel that's like silicone
not so good for a moisturizer
this moisturizer in particular does not work for my skin
the hydroblur moisturizer is not something i would recommend
this hydroblur moisturizer was a definite pass for me
mix it with another moisturizer
i feel like this is more of a primer than a moisturizer
i need to use my regular moisturizer with it.
it really fails as a moisturizer
it was too thick to use as a daytime moisturizer
this is just not the best moisturizer or the best primer so
wore it as a moisturizer with cc cream
it was as if i had not applied any moisturizer.
i like how soft my skin feels from the moisturizer
i love the way my skin feels after applying the creme
my skin pretty much rejected this moisturizer.
this cannot be called a moisturizer.
how they market this as a moisturizer
i'd been using it as my moisturizer after a serum
i like gel moisturizers for daytime use to prevent extra shine from breaking through my makeup
i love this as a morning moisturizer.
doesn't do anything my regular gel lotions do
not the best moisturizer for my skin
because it reads more like a moisturizer/toner to me
i would say this is a gimmick to get younger people to use moisturizers
i actually really love the way this moisturizer feels
i found the "perfect" moisturizer
this moisturizer made my skin very oily within a few hours
i always have to add another moisturizer to it.
the product itself feels like any other gel moisturizer
this product would be best as a primer as opposed to a moisturizer
i did like how this moisturizer made my skin feel
as most creams are too heavy for my skin
fell in love with the gold sheen of the moisturizer
this moisturizer is awful
this is the stickiest moisturizer i have ever used
i still applied a silicone primer before my foundation to make my skin look perfect
the moisturizer stays tacky far too long.
i like the concept of tatcha offering a water/ gel type of moisturizer
i'd always have to follow it with a second exfoliator
keep in mind i exfoliate my face twice a day
i felt dried out even after applying moisturizer.
i really loved this moisturizer
it really is just another sunscreen for the face
this has like a lotion feel
unfortunately, this isn't the moisturizer for me.
this eye cream is great!
nighttime moisturizer for over a month now
i mixed with a moisturizer
this is a nice lightweight moisturizer
i love how light the moisturizer is
it is a good moisturizer
i needed to lather on a different moisturizer to make up for its dryness
you get a good amount of moisturizer as well
took a break from this moisturizer
it did not take off mascara
mascara spread all over my face
i needed a day cream to mix with my foundation.
it seems more like an essence than a moisturizer
the price is just out of this world for a lightweight moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer that gives a dewy finish
i used it as serum with just a couple of drops underneath my moisturizer
it's too light of a moisturizer to use alone
i needed a moisturizer that wasnt so thick
this moisturizer just did nothing for me
i still had to use a moisturizer after this
my moisturizer already gives me a nice glow
this moisturizer was really the only thing that i had changed in my skincare routine
i like the feeling of this moisturizer
i enjoyed using this as a light moisturizer
light moisturizer to throw in my bag for travel
worked well as a nighttime moisturizer
unfortunately it doesn't work as a moisturizer.
there are way better moisturizers out there
i would never purchase a moisturizer with this much alcohol
i'd like to use this as a daily moisturizer
the formula contains no sunscreen
it literally died out my skin rather than moisturizing it
shouldn't even be called a moisturizer!
use it as a night moisturizer
i wanted to use this as a moisturizer under my foundation
i previously used murad's mattifying moisturizer
to say this product was my holy grail daily moisturizer would be an understatement
this moisturizer did not work for me at all !
i wish they brought back their sister product the sephora collection: acne fighting mattifying moisturizer
i love the normal sephora moisturizer
i hope sephora comes out with a different spf face moisturizer that isn't so drying
use this over my sephora instant moisturizer
the moisturizer itself is not that impressive
however i need a good moisturizer during wintertime or my skin dries
this moisturizer was highly recommended to me by one of the skincare specialists in the store
a better description of the product would be a mattifying primer with sunscreen
it doesn't work as a moisturizer either
sunscreen that was unfortunately discontinued
it is definitely mattifying
which i like as i find most sunscreens too oily
it tends to pill if you use a moisturizer underneath
then a water base lotion
moisturizer to complete my skin care routine
when i used this it made my skin super dry i even had to use another moisturizer on top of it
it is a slightly thicker consistency than my other moisturizers
heavy moisturizer that felt like a layer of product over my skin
i cannot see how a facial moisturizer with all that glitter can be of any benefit to me at all
this moisturizer feels so thick
it is the worst moisturizer i've ever tried
definitely not for an all over the face moisturizer
then in that same area my skin started peeling a little i tried moisturizing more
i am in love with the tidal moisturizer
even after using my strongest moisturizer to try to fix it
for the hefty price tag i thought this would be a miracle moisturizer as i have extremely oily skin
the cool feeling of this moisturizer
i used it since i used up my moisturizer
i like the rebuilding moisturizer way better
it was a decent moisturizer
have to add my own moisturizer to it
even with me adding a second moisturizer to it
it works so great as a highlighter
i did not feel it is a skin care product- more like a highlighter
all i can say is i did not feel any moisturizing effects from this cream
is this a highlighter or an eye cream?
this product just felt like a decent moisturizer
especially applying at bedtime
have a hard time finding a moisturizer that works for my whole face
this was a good daily moisturizer in the sense that it isn't heavy
my face didn't feel more moisturizer
it's just a lotion to me.
i think i would rather just use my normal face moisturizer
then my radiance primer as opposed to this slightly shimmery moisturizer
it leaves a white cast like a sunscreen would.
it's like putting a lotion on your face
can leave it feeling slightly moisturizer
i saw some reviews saying it's moisturizing
i could get these results by using a heavy moisturizer
no amount of moisturizer could save it.
followed up with their age prevention moisturizer
moisturizer from youth to the people
it's an okay moisturizer.
i find myself having to use this product at night after using a serum or with another moisturizer
it's a ok moisturizer, but that is it.
this moisturizer is not great for my combination skin
this moisturizer felt nice
it's the most drying moisturizer i've ever used
i actually have to moisturize with another moisturizer within 1/2 hour of applying this
it's perhaps the worst moisturizer i've tried
it is an okay moisturizer
i cannot wait to finish it and switch day creams.
your face doesn't even feel like you applied a moisturizer
i like to layer it under my day-time moisturizer with sunscreen or even under a heavier night cream
i found it dry and cakey.
after some research on the product i assumed this was a moisturizer cream type product
found it is a medium toned full coverage concealer
moisturizer in order to apply without having it cake up
i've tried it after moisturizer and primer.
great around eyes with concealer for smooth coverage
it doesn't get rid of all my waterproof mascara.
it wasn't waterproof mascara.
i don't really notice any moisturizing benefits after i use this
it doesn't take away waterproof mascara or liner.
it was a nice moisturizer but that was it.
it was just a good moisturizer.
at least a moisturizer that
i used it combined with the bye bye under eye concealer
i think all daytime creams should have spf already in them
we all know no cream is a miracle cream
i think it's a good moisturizer
this is a moisturizer and that's all.
in the morning use kiehl's avocado eye cream in the morning which is also so much more hydrating than this eye cream
i love the undereye concealer
it is a good cream for the winter
for an eye cream at sephora
not as bad as the concealer creme
made my eyes look worse under concealer
my concealer creased worse than ever before
then i put on the bye bye concealer
i like the feel of this lotion
it's literally moisturizer with glitter in it
all i use is moisturizer on my face
i realize that every skincare
this moisturizer is very thick
this is definitely the moisturizer for you
i know it's not my diet or makeup so the only thing i can point to is this moisturizer
this moisturizer is to thick
i still felt dry after applying a generous amount of moisturizer
if they ever make this unscented i'll have my hg cream
i like the cream
added it to my night routine as a moisturizer
went with the cream instead because it seemed more moisturizing
it didn't keep my face moisturizer for very long
i will say as a moisturizer it is thick
$50+ just for sunscreen is silly.
i tried to use a moisturizer to make it blend easier
it only sat on top of the moisturizer
although this does have a physical sunscreen
i do find that i only need to wear concealer
then use a foundation or tinted moisturizer or something to cover
i wanted something that would be like skincare
this product has a "sunscreen slip" feeling
i don't know why this is in the moisturizer category
it was a great moisturizer
should it be used before or after you moisturizer your face?
even if you've already applied super duper creams/moisturizers
wanted to add something to my regimen with spf
would not recommend alone as a moisturizer
the mineral sunscreen was also a plus.
although it's more expensive than my typical moisturizers/spfs
end my skin take well this moisturizer look matte all day
it does work well with waterproof mascara though
it can't even take off my eyeshadow.
it did do a good job of removing waterproof mascara
my mascara was not completely washed off
no frills primer or lotion
i made the mistake of treating it like a daytime moisturizer
i think it's fine as a non-comedogenic nighttime moisturizer
the soft cream does not absorb well over serum or a lighter lotion
i think i'll stick to using the serum along with another moisturizer cream
this is a nice, gentle moisturizer.
i really liked this as a moisturizer
i seriously look like i used a crisco moisturizer
feel of a heavy night cream
if i am paying over $70- for a moisturizer
any concealer i put on looks like a mess.
used face finishing moisturizer during the day
this product is a decent face moisturizer
mascara on a daily basis
very little foundation with a swipe of mascara
press a little under my eyes during the day if my concealer gets cakey
i couldn't blend this moisturizer.
i couldn't blend this moisturizer.
the smell of this moisturizer was not tolerable
i do not recommend this moisturizer.
gave me a white cast like sunblock
as if i had just put on white sunscreen
it has a matte dry feel to it which is kind of weird since it is a moisturizer
getting the clinique yellow moisturizer much better deal
the moisturizer is very thick and went on smooth.
back on the hunt for my holy grail moisturizer.
i think i was expecting rich creamy moisturizer
i spend a lot more money on moisturizer
for moisturizer, it does a fantastic job.
remove my waterproof mascara
once i put my moisturizer on my skin felt good though
i tried this eye cream hoping it would help moisturize my eye area as other reviews
this eye cream was just a glorified moisturizer to me
this is not a cream
the moisturizer gets patchy in certain spots of your face
this has never happened with any moisturizers
doesn't really do anything as a "moisturizer
when you apply this moisturizer you can see the glitter in the skin
if you want to look like edward cullen sparkling in the sunlight then this is the moisturizer for you
the moisturizer is not highlighting
works well as a moisturizer
this is a beautiful illuminating moisturizer
it's a great moisturizer to go under foundation.
it is a regular facial moisturizer with tons of glitter in it
maybe would be nice for a highlighter
not all over the face as a moisturizer
it is alright as a moisturizer
i loved the feeling of the moisturizer itself
i don't even put that much as eyeshadow!
it's too heavy for it to not moisturizer at all
it did moisturizer my skin
this is simply a glittery lotion for your face.
it gives you glitter in your moisturizer lol
it doesnt feel or work like a moisturizer
this felt more like a primer than a moisturizer
the moisturizer comes off no problem
this "moisturizer" just has glitter in it
i found the moisturizer to be quite drying
moisturizer with some microglitter in it
this moisturizer has so much shimmer highlight pigment in it- not in the good way you would think
you may as well mix in some shimmer pigment with your moisturizer
can't wear this moisturizer all over face.
really wish tarte would have eliminated the sparkles in this highlighting moisturizer
i think this moisturizer is nice.
shimmer to where it's applied so probably not to be used as an all over moisturizer
i really wanted to love this moisturizer.
i wanted to try a new illuminating moisturizer
this is microfine glitter in a lightweight moisturizer
it looks like i'm wearing a cheap glitter moisturizer meant for kids from claire's or something
i want people to know that this is a pink based moisturizer
bought their shimmer moisturizer
was a great base for eyeliner
it layers very nicely under concealer.
as far as a treatment or moisturizer- forget it
it was a good primer under my concealer though.
it held my concealer throughout the day
my concealer usually stays put well anyway
i do think that this cream works great as a primer for eyeshadow or your face in general
i really didnt like this eye cream.
i wear eye cream daily
i love eye creams
it's a good moisturizer for sure
i used this eye cream
my other eye creams i have work just as well
its a very thick cream similar in texture to a moisturizer something rich you would use at night
i still needed an additional moisturizer on top
i did not find this product moisturizing on its own
i would probably add it to my skincare routine
i don't feel like this is a good moisturizer or could even be considered a serum
this serum-lotion goes on nicely
this product isn't really a moisturizer.
i either needed a serum under it or a moisturizer over it to feel like i was getting enough hydration
on my skin i can only use the tiniest dab or it just balls up the moment i try to add other skincare or makeup over the serum
i layer my skincare
smells great, and applies like a moisturizer.
it is a good moisturizer
i don't like it as a moisturizer either
i do not like this as a moisturizer or primer.
it doesn't work as a primer or as a moisturizer for me
overall, i wanted to use this as a moisturizer.
it's just a very light moisturizer
a priming moisturizer sounds like a great idea
and my mascara traveled because of that.
the idea of a nice moisturizer that is also a primer
i want to point out that it's a priming moisturizer
a moisturizer are 2 different things
i still had to use my regular moisturizer first
then i applied this priming moisturizer instead of my usual moisturizer
after washing my face i applied my usual moisturizer
at first i thought it was the moisturizer i used before it
average moisturizer - could do with or without.
fab extra repaire cream is my holy grail moisturizer of all times
this moisturizer would not let my foundation stick to my nose for the life of me
i do love the luminosity this moisturizer gives
not any better than just using a lotion
i like to use this product as a primer after i have already applied my daily moisturizer
did not apply moisturizer as i usually do
i only wear sunscreen
this product did not remove my foundation or concealer
yes it's a lotion consistency
definitely don't get the exfoliating ones!
i love dior skincare
this product went on like a moisturizer instead of a mask
it felt more like a moisturizer to me than a mask
decided to purchase this moisturizer since it has great reviews
which i thought it was weird for being a gel moisturizer
keep skin moisturizer throughout the day
i liked it as moisturizer, felt good on the skin.
i liked the idea that it's a moisturizer
my makeup didn't pill.
this moisturizer is very uncomfortable
better suited as just a moisturizer.
my other moisturizer did not cause this
this moisturizer was the only thing i changed in my skincare routine
felt more like a primer than a moisturizer.
was excited to try a nice moisturizer
i tried it several times as my only moisturizer
i didn't mind using it in conjunction with another moisturizer
i guess i will have to stick to my heavy moisturizers for night
the gel cream formula does feel great when i apply it
t's obvious after one day if a product works as a sunscreen or not
the cream/lotion version in the silver tube
i usually use nars vanilla concealer as a reference
this moisturizer feels nice on the face
this product is so expensive for just an ok moisturizer
i went to sephora for good moisturizer
supposedly the murad moisturizer would do the same thing
just go buy a moisturizer
moisturizer i still get dry
it could also have been the serum or lotion
the eye lotion has been ok
this moisturizer is so heavy
it just feels like plain sunscreen on my face
low spf which smells strongly of sunscreen
bought this moisturizer because i needed something with an spf
this moisturizer feels much more like sunscreen --
not good for a day cream.
this product feels more like sunscreen
this product is a sunscreen first
i've used clinique's other spf moisturizers before
none of them had a noticeable sunscreen scent like this one
i loved the hydroblur clinique moisturizer
enjoy the blur moisturizer so much better
this eye cream is very light and gel like.
i really like the light gel consistency of this eye cream
eventually i decided to switch to another moisturizer
maybe it was just to deep of a moisturizer for me
next time i'll choose something more moisturizing
this cream would be great for combination skin.
she said this cream has a lot of synthetics
it seems like an interesting moisturizer because of the half gel/ half cream
i still dont find the moisturizing effect it claims after putting on the cream
cheaper moisturizers out there
also odd- the josie moisturizer with spf works like a dream for me
i can get more from the intensive lotion
i definitely spend a lot of money on skincare products
it isn't even a great moisturizer
spend the rest on a good retinol treatment or the argan milk
this moisturizer did not work for me
the moisturizer is good when its first applied
i didnt find any purpose of this moisturizer.
i probably would go with a different moisturizer
this moisturizer literally make my skin so nice
i wish it came in as a perfume or lotion.
this is a heavy moisturizer.
even in the summer i use a good moisturizer
i would expect a moisturizer to still have its place in a layered routine
better to just stick to a brightening serum a different moisturizer
i love how this moisturizer feels when combined with good genes in the morning
i barely got breakout before with any moisturizer
i love the packaging of this moisturizer.
this moisturizer is way too heavy
the moisturizer is very heavy
tidal is my favorite moisturizer
which i personally think is a better moisturizer
i tried using it as my facial moisturizer
the cream felt lightweight
works great under makeup/sunscreen
i only wear tinted moisturizer
em with the moisturizer
except for my stubborn waterproof mascara
heavy duty moisturizer in the few days i was using the face wash
this was my first ever splurge on a face cream
my favorite thing to splurge on is a great moisturizer
this is an alright moisturizer
've tried a lot of moisturizers
it was a nice night time moisturizer.
was really excited to try a high end moisturizer
also the fragrance is too strong for a moisturizer
it was the most disappointing moisturizer i've ever used
it's no better than any other average moisturizer
it's a regular moisturizer like any other br
it's just an average moisturizer
a lot of eye creams do that
just had better eye creams.
had to use another moisturizer
i've tried using it with a water-based moisturizer
the product is a lighy pink serum it reminds me of a very light moisturizer
when i wear foundation over top of this serum it tends to pill
does not mix well with concealer
it would still ball up under concealer regardless of the type of concealer or method of application
bought this product with high hopes that it'll be a good moisturizer for my combo skin
not the best moisturizer but also not the worst.
have to use concealer under my eyes despite using this product
it is the type of moisturizer that feels greasy after you apply it
this moisturizer in particular has done nothing special for me
i will continue my search for the perfect moisturizer for my oily skin
not sure if it's me or the lotion
i'd rather use a moisturizer that does not dry out my cheeks
perfect for morning skincare
this did look a little more matte than a regular moisturizer once i rubbed it in
felt like any old moisturizer to me.
the search for the perfect combo skin moisturizer continues
my old moisturizer got discontinued
it was the only moisturizer that didn't break me out
i liked the texture of the moisturizer
while normally i like to use up moisturizers i've purchased
so i finally decided to try this moisturizer.
this moisturizer was just okay for me.
staying matte on other people
i think this would be a good lightweight moisturizer for someone with normal to combo skin
i liked this moisturizer
a moisturizing face lotion because using this too many days in a row can lead to dry patches
this is a very light moisturizer suitable for very oily skin
i would say that it's definitely a lightweight moisturizer which was great
i found that the moisturizer was ok
this has not happened with other moisturizers
this moisturizer was just ok for me.
i will be sticking to the sheet transformation moisturizer for now
i thoroughly enjoyed that this lotion was very light
the texture is light weight like lotion
not my favorite moisturizer.
the moisturizer did it again
i spend a lot of money on my skincare regime
i can use my regular moisturizer for that
this cream gave me milia
great lotion for the face
i get that it's a lotion
i still don't fully believe that a tinted moisturizer product can be a tint
a moisturizer all in one
going back to my nars tinted moisturizer
i love tinted moisturizers as i hate wearing heavy makeup
it is a tinted moisturizer so there's not a whole lot of coverage
with the product description i expected a tinted moisturizer not a tinted sunscreen
i tried applying it in place of my normal moisturizer
it does prep the skin for moisturizer very well
lightweight that it almost felt like a lotion rather than an eye cream
provides a perfect canvas for concealer/any makeup application
the moisturizer just make my skin very dry.
you know absolutely nothing about skincare
it is too oily to be a moisturizer or primer.
i can only use it by moisturizing first then applying it
when i used this before applying my highlighter
mascara that i would go through a bottle in a week
it did not take off my mascara
will not remove eyeliner or mascara at all
this product seems to be the replacement for the oil-free daytime moisturizer
oil-free nighttime moisturizer that appear to be discontinued
wants a lightweight moisturizer that wears well under makeup
this is a lightweight moisturizer
this product helps people who feel greasy/oily when they apply moisturizer
this moisturizer is fine but not great.
this moisturizer is very light
it seems more like a night cream than a day cream
spf because i figured it was time to switch to a spf moisturizer
if i wanted to noticeably wear sunscreen on my face i'd just wear sunscreen
the moisturizer became very oily on my skin
now i'm trying to find another moisturizer.
other than that it was an ok sunscreen.
just can't be used as a daily moisturizer
feels too much like sunscreen than an everyday moisturizer
i also loved that the spf 25 moisturizer provided protection
didn't feel like sunscreen
"pore vanishing moisturizer"...not really.
this almost feels like a sleeping mask rather than a moisturizer
i would definitely keep looking if you are in the market for a great brightening/ exfoliating mask
t wasn't even waterproof mascara
so far i like this as much as i like the anti aging moisturizer
on nights when i don't use this i usually use a balm to oil moisturizer
other reviewers say it removes waterproof mascara
it doesn't moisturizer like i need it to
gross because i could still feel that layer from the moisturizer
it's recommended to apply this gel
this cream made me oily
will agree its a great moisturizer
the moisturizer is lightweight
i try to keep my moisturizers as lightweight as possible
the water cream is a new addition to my regimen.
it's a nice lightweight moisturizer
the water cream is an amazing moisturizer
this moisturizer was pretty average.
i'd recommend the clinique dramatically different moisturizer for oily skin
i wore only the moisturizer
i really wanted this to be my end all be all pre makeup moisturizer
the moisturizer felt great
also did not sit well under concealer.
the saving grace of this moisturizer was the baby-soft skin it gave me after using it
it just wasn't worth it as 'just' a moisturizer
it did not moisturize and i saw nothing.
the sunscreen starting beading up
ruins the concealer application
my moisturizer didnt sink into my skin as well
however, it left me running for the moisturizer.
this moisturizer smells great
i figured out that the moisturizer
my search for the perfect summer time moisturizer continues
i do an aha mask/peel once a week as part of my regimen
it doesn't touch my waterproof mascara except to smear it a bit
countered with some lotion and all is good.
leaves skin somewhat dry until you apply a moisturizer
i love their face mask an night mask esspecily in the blue or i believe light pink which ever is moisturizing
is peeling despite heavy moisturizer
this moisturizer didn't break me out or irritate me
it just felt like moisturizer
definitely not for daytime use either—it pills like crazy under sunscreen
i really didn't like this moisturizer.
i liked this moisturizer a lot
wanted to love this moisturizer as the packaging is beautiful
i really wanted to love this moisturizer.
the moisturizer was never absorbed
it's an interesting product that you apply at end of your skincare regimen
sometimes i use a heavier moisturizer on dryer patches
even for a night moisturizer
this moisturizer did not fit in that category.
ugh.... i hated this moisturizer.
there are better moisturizers out there
it's a moisturizer that's supposed to naturally bronze
it was too orange to be bronzing
there are better tinted moisturizers that offer better coverage
this moisturizer left a gray cast on my face
i think a fair price for this small tube of tinted moisturizer would be $18
there is no moisturizer that can boost your energy
i would need to use concealer
it's working just fine with a lighter concealer
my skin was already fairly glowy from vacation tan
it took a while to get my skin back to normal -- i love serums
it actually worked more like a good moisturizer than an expensive serum
i don't know why a strong fragrance would be added to a serum
this is a good moisturizer
her retinol eye cream is way way better!
i tried concealer with just this
this moisturizer wasn't too heavy
i felt like even though it was a moisturizer
i went to put my oils/moisturizer on
followed with my moisturizer as the product directed
many times i put this moisturizer on it stung my face
used to love this moisturizer now not so much
i tried this moisturizer thinking it'd be suitable for my combination sensitive skin prone to redness
my skin seems to drink up this cream
the cream comes in a jar.
no needd for toner or rarely moisturizer with boscia
non greasy this moisturizer is
i do not think this moisturizer is worth the money
on paper, this moisturizer sounds good.
this moisturizer came in the $25 mini kit.
it's the cheapest moisturizer i've gotten
i wish this moisturizer worked for me
nothing else changed in my routine except adding this moisturizer- zits came back
tried it as a night cream along with my usual serums
i found this moisturizer to be so greasy!
ive had a lot of moisturizers that have absorbed really well
the moisturizer came in great packaging
the best thing about this is that it is a light weight moisturizer
this is the second time i've tried this moisturizer
this moisturizer was not enough to combat my dry skin
1 hour after applying my mattifying primer
this moisturizer feels nice
if you like thin moisturizers
this is a very light moisturizer that dries almost immediately
alone moisturizer in the winter months because it doesn't adequately moisturize my very dry skin for the entire night or day
this moisturizer didn't do anything for it
ended up using another moisturizer over it
this moisturizer did nothing for me.
maybe this moisturizer works better for other skin types
layers well under moisturizer
after i put this on i use a good moisturizer.
every time i used it once i applied moisturizer
you'll need to put on moisturizer straight after.
apply a moisturizer/make up routine about 30 mins later
you can blend it out with a good moisturizer
biggest waste of money i've spent on a moisturizer that's supposed to mattify
i kept using this moisturizer
a good one i found is the belief oil control fresh moisturizer
overall, i like this moisturizer.
i heard nice things about this moisturizer
i used up this entire moisturizer within 2-3 months
this one though i think it was just an average moisturizer
i gave this moisturizer a full week of use to give it a shot
i tried this moisturizer as a suggestion from one of the sephora staff
i wanted to love this moisturizer.
i don't normally break out from a moisturizer
i switched to another moisturizer
decided to try this moisturizer because i had read it is good for oily skin
i very moisturizing however when i rub it all over my face
this moisturizer felt nice during initial application
i really like the eye cream
i even happily splurge on their body lotion.
any review that suggests using it as an under-makeup moisturizer
this is the worst moisturizer i have ever used.
i will say it is a great cream for those with dry or flaky skin from winter or retinol products
worth the splurge if you need that extra umph in your moisturizer
it is a great moisturizer
apply another strongly scented moisturizer
i don't like this moisturizer at all.
it does appear to be a good moisturizer though
now i have to look for a new moisturizer
i would love it as a night time moisturizer
this moisturizer is amazing on my dry skin
just your typical drug store moisturizer.
for that reason i will continue my search for the magical moisturizer
this is a nice moisturizer
this used to be my favorite moisturizer back in 2006
hope in a jar seemed to work no better than most of my moisturizers
i wanted to try a new moisturizer because the br
this is a good moisturizer if you can get use to the consultancy
my friend strongly recommended me this moisturizer
hope in a jar is a basic moisturizer
love the fact that my skin absorbs the moisturizer on contact
this is too light-weight for a moisturizer for me
not sure if it's me or the moisturizer
unfortunately i did not like this moisturizer at all
not the best moisturizer out there
it did not do a great job moisturizing for me
this lotion was the only new addition to my regimen
it's an ok moisturizer.
my eyes kept watering while i put on the moisturizer
i don't think it is s good moisturizer for the colder
many people recommended to use this moisturizer
given me gross dry patches that no amount of moisturizer or facial oils can seem to fix
i figured same brand, it's a retinol, why not?
nice product to be used as a night moisturizer
i don't think any eye creams actually change the color of your undereye
making concealer easier to put on
you could just as easily put your regular moisturizer
just a regular eye cream
buying the only thing that ever worked for me: murad vitamin c undereye cream with spf 15
i do like this eye cream
just an ok eye gel
works well under concealer during the day
one of the best moisturizers i've used
i really wanted to like this moisturizer
the strong fragrance of this cream does not go well with my skin type
this has never happened to me with any other moisturizer
this lotion is just that.
i tried this lotion for months
i've tried other moisturizers that do give you a glow
i chose this because i was out of moisturizer
this moisturizer gives me pimples.
i really liked this moisturizer.
think that is the best moisturizer i ever used
i don't think i'll buy the moisturizing cream again
i find that i still always have mascara in my eyelashes
you'll need something more exfoliating
like i was wiping a milky kids type lotion on my face
applying my normal moisturizer after
that's what moisturizer is for
may still use the lotion
this gel can't move my mascara off.
which is the bareminerals tinted moisturizer with a little bit of concealer for hyperpigmentation
will such for a better moisturizer first instead
i like how moisturizing it is however it hasn't done anything for my dark circles or wrinkles
i put three stars because i like how moisturizing it is which is great for my concealer
this under eye cream is ok.
my skin didn't like it as a daily moisturizer
this product is a great moisturizer
was in the market for a new moisturizer
smell reminded me of sunscreen
ended up returning it for another more light weight moisturizer
this moisturizer doesn't last for 24
it just wasn't moisturizing enough even for daytime use
it feels like a drugstore night cream
this cream was great at moisturizing my face by the smell is soooooooo strong
this moisturizer caused me to break out after one use
this moisturizer smells great
this is a great moisturizer
i love the smell of this moisturizer
this moisturizer is just okay for me.
the consistency of the moisturizer is really thin
great basic moisturizer for every day use
the feel of the cream
this moisturizer is ok... nothing special.
figured that the moisturizer would be much of the same
i do recommend the night cream
i think it's a good light moisturizer for spring/summer
moisturizer is a must after this
using different moisturizers that i have loved
all i wear is tinted moisturizer
he says its a light moisturizer
it feels more like a moisturizer
is seems more like a moisturizer then a pore minimizer
walked into sephora to buy a moisturizer that would fix my dry patches
the specialists suggested using this moisturizer as it would calm
i hate when a moisturizer makes my skin feel tight rather than dewy
need to use another moisturizer on top
this was an all around good lotion.
this is a really nice moisturizer.
i started using this moisturizer because a dermadoctor rep was at sephora that day
this is one really expensive moisturizer
i buy eye cream all the time
i used this in combination with the moisturizer
as for mascara, it definitely doesn't work.
it leaves mascara and eyeliner behind.
all i had been wearing was tinted moisturizer
i figured i would be amazed by a mattifying moisturizer this expensive
cheap sunscreen on my face
blend with this moisturizer on your face
this moisturizer unfortunately broke me out
like to use a moisturizer for that reason
i like to use this product as a nighttime moisturizer because it does work
this is okay as a nighttime moisturizer
it's not a mattifying moisturizer
use a gel moisturizer instead
invest in a nice gel moisturizer
this lotion made it very difficult for me to put on my tinted cc cream as it did not glide on my skin at all
i didn't like this moisturizer.
i prefer facial moisturizer without fragrance
tried this moisturizer out
as other reviewers have pointed out i dont really want a perfume in my moisturizer
normally i'm not oily with other light moisturizers until 5-6 hours
this moisturizer was way too heavy for me
i prefer gel-type moisturizers
this did great as a moisturizer
the texture of this moisturizer is pretty thick coming out of the pot
i would call this more of a solid perfume than a moisturizer
voila there it was: perfume in a moisturizer
i tried this moisturizer thinking it might help
more of a balm than a moisturizer, just fyi.
i do tend to use pricey skincare
as you would a moisturizer
i've used caudalie's vinoperfect moisturizer which worked out great for me
i needed to load on the moisturizer
it moisturizers, but no miracles take place.
although this eye cream is a good moisturizer
it did moisturize but that's about it.
does work well with concealer
i don't wear foundation or concealer on top of this
usually i use this after my final moisturizing step
i think you would be better served by putting your money into a really good overnight moisturizer like caudalie crème riche
it should not be listed as a moisturizer
using a moisturizer with an spf in the morning
the facewash cream is just not for me
contemplating returning it because it does moisturize my face
had to use another moisturizer
i can just use my regular moisturizer
this cream is quite heavy
this is a very heavy cream
my skin was so dry i had to pile on other moisturizers
followed it with a light moisturizer
i couldent put a moisturizer over it
i hate sticky after sun lotion
the lotion had an okay texture
i am sticking to good old aloe next time!
thought that this moisturizer would be perfect to help with keeping it moisturized
this face cream is greasy
i wanted a moisturizing night cream for the start of the winter months
so i tried l'occitance's utltra rich cream.
i wouldn't spend my money on this moisturizer
i found it sort of greasy like suntan lotion
this cream is way to rich
needed a moisturizer to make my skin normal again
found this to be just average compared to my previous moisturizers
really wanted to love this lotion based on all the reviews
really bummed to see that this lotion is made with parabens when their other products do not
not much better than drugstore moisturizer after one month of nightly use
not a bad moisturizer, but will not reorder.
the perfecting day lotion as my routine
it really is just a moisturizer.
i felt this moisturizer sitting on my face all day
this moisturizer is a great hydrator for nighttime use especially in the winter time
it is an average moisturizer for the price
is a good daily spf
i returned this for a different sunscreen moisturizer
i can get some cheap sunblock from the drugstore to do the same thing
i found myself reaching for my retouching powder before lunchtime
i really did love this moisturizer.
tend to not be harsh about moisturizers
this "moisturizer" is just not
this moisturizer is way too heavy
this moisturizer has water listed as one of the first few ingredients
i would think it's a great moisturizer for those with super dry skin
this moisturizer is not great for oily/combination skin
the moisturizer smells good
seemed like an ideal day moisturizer given its good spf coverage
this moisturizer just sort of sits on the surface of my skin
i'll be trying out other murad sunscreen options.
i noticed it had the consistency of heavy sunscreen
this moisturizer clearly broke me out
it was too much like a sunscreen
not enough like a moisturizer
sunblock causes my face to look like an oil slick
i enjoy using sephora's mattifying spf 20 moisturizer
this is a light weight moisturizer with vitamin-c
i can honestly say it's exactly like murad's regular skin perfecting face lotion
i don't see why this lotion costs more than twice what the other lotion costs
each time the lotion is way too heavy for my skin
it also smells strongly of sunscreen
to find lotion without it
back to the drawing board for something more moisturizing
finding a moisturizer with spf that works for me is difficult
this is a pretty good moisturizer.
the thought process of whoever decided it was a good idea for facial moisturizers to have a strong fragrance
i loved this moisturizer at first
the moisturizer absorbed into my skin fairly well
the lotion would probably be good if i was clean shaven
thought this moisturizer would help
now i gotta look for another moisturizer
i agreed to try this cream after asking an associate about a moisturizing
this is an eye cream.
as for the eye cream
it interfered with the concealer application
i never thought about splurging on creams like this
everyone's skin takes to certain creams better than others
it is a great light moisturizer for the skin around your eyes
this is an ok eye cream
not really sure that i fell in love with this moisturizer
which stings when i put on lotion
this is like putting aloe on your face
my experience with this moisturizer was just mediocre
it was a fine eye cream
i ordered this by accident- i meant to order the mega rich face cream which is a nice summer moisturizer for my dry skin
for an eye crème.
i used it with the retinol night ointment
not a fan for a day eye cream.
the cream is ok.
feels like i am putting drug store body lotion under eyes
i will keep trying more eye creams out
this could be a good preventative wrinkle cream
thought i'd try out a new moisturizer for dry winter skin
as it's more of a lotion
this moisturizer turned out to be grimey
this moisturizer was described as soothing however it sat on my skin
bought this moisturizer after having a wonderful experience with the korres yogurt night cream
when i switched to a different moisturizer
i like this moisturizer, but i don't love it.
moisturizer in the store
this moisturizer balls up
disappointed i spent this much for a moisturizer.
i already have a moisturizer that works great for me
at the end of my day just a decent moisturizer
this had been the only lotion/moisturizer that i have used that removes fine lines
ask about the moisturizers that i picked online
two ladies told me to buy this moisturizer
this moisturizer works wonder for her
this moisturizer barely lasts on me
i ended up choosing this facial moisturizer
time to look for another moisturizer...
this moisturizer didn't break me out
it's not a thick cream or lotion
night cream is better
this moisturizer offers instant
this product is where i would set the bar for my moisturizers
i found this moisturizer okay
it was not the best moisturizer for me
it's a good eye moisturizer
i usually use pure argan oil as my night time moisturizer
i would recommend it as an eye cream
i used this product as an eye contour cream twice a day
it reminds me of a sticky lipgloss
i am trying to find an eye cream
it's basically just an expensive moisturizer.
when i put concealer over it
it made the concealer crease
i do however like the hydrapure lotion a lot
go with the lotion
i recently bought his maximum moisture treatment lotion
a little extra moisturizer helped
my plan is to get the moisturizer from this line
with the hope that he would stop using my dramatically different moisturizing gel
it is a great moisturizer
with other creams its goes away with more sleep
this was basically lotion for under my eyes
the wrinkle eye cream
at best, it's a great moisturizer.
it's moisturizing, so i gave it an average.
i guess i need to read the fine print 'cause when i read the name "scruffing lotion" i was thinking it would exfoliate to remove the dead flakes
my makeup routine is just tinted moisturizer
the application was nice and it lathered well.
i would still have mascara smears under my eyes
moisturizer directly after is a must.
i think drug store eye creams do more work than this one
if you just want a not too pricey eye cream that does basic moisturizing
it is very good to moisturizer
that is all this cream does
i can use cheaper cream to moisturizer my eye's skin
it did nothing other than moisturize my undereye area every night
does moisturizer the area well
this eye cream is ok
i want benefits i'm not getting with my facial moisturizer
helps protect my skin from a lot of tugging when i put on concealer/foundation
i do find when i apply eyeshadow later on
the gel cream goes on nicely
it does seem to do a decent job of holding concealer in place
so it's not my power house wrinkle cream.
this one is just a really basic eye cream.
it is definitely more of a cream than a gel now.
although its a thicker consistency than the gel lotion
it feels like the same lotion they have for women
this lotion will not work too well
on the hunt once again for a good oily skin moisturizer
i usually like to switch out my moisturizer to something more lightweight
i used this moisturizer before
switched back to my old moisturizer
this is truly the worst moisturizer.
i never had this issue with a moisturizer.
this is a good moisturizer
i believe the lotion is better for dryer skin styles
there are many other matte moisturizers that work better
it didn't help moisturize my face anymore than the cheap face moisturizer from trader joe's
i liked this moisturizer
i prefer the lotion
i've used this moisturizer for combination skin since i was a teenager
the moisturizer doesn't seem to be completely effective
sometimes i can feel the layer of moisturizer on top of my skin
i've found a better moisturizer for my skin
this moisturizer is terrible
i didn't hate this moisturizer
yeah this moisturizer was good for my oily skin like it stayed matte for a long time
purchased this lotion twice with the entire line
my face is still dry even with moisturizer.
i really like the bienfait moisturizer
the lotion is really not for me
skin was still dry, was not a good moisturizer.
i tend to have a problem with the ingredients used in physical sunscreen
my skin did not get any benefit from this lotion
this spf lotion was not compatiable with my skin.
i used an spf 40 sunscreen protection over this moisturizer being that i live in sunny california
still in search of a better moisturizer
this moisturizer smells great
it's hard to find moisturizers with anything higher than spf 15
it is a nice, light lotion though.
i needed a moisturizer that was light
i've read some reviews saying it was great for a daily moisturizer
had high expectations for this lotion
" this moisturizer did not meet my expectations
i'll probably return this lotion for the bienfait day cream
though it takes mascara off my lashes
it also wasn't very effective in taking off my waterproof eyeliner
especially my waterproof eyeliner
my waterproof eyeliner was still on
eyeshadow wasn't completely removed by this balm
you also have to rub to get waterproof mascara off
the search for perfect spf eye cream continues
i like using my mineral powder based sunscreen made exclusively for the eye area because i can reapply throughout the day
even over my undereye concealer
you need a smaller amount than other eye creams
i like this eye cream.
it really is a fine eye cream.
this is a so-so moisturizer
i like my daytime eye cream to contain spf
am careful about using sunblock in everything
attention all skincare lines: stop putting spfs in eye cream
it's better than some creams i've tried
my guess is be i over exfoliate
but if you use moisturizer, that will cover it.
pounds of moisturizer just to get it back to normal
it did not remove my non-waterproof mascara
one of the best moisturizers i've ever used in my life
i need to apply moisturizer immediately after washing my face with this cleanser or else my face starts to feel tight
finally i tried a different moisturizer
also good for you because it's also skincare"
has the consistency of a light tinted moisturizer
i do exfoliating my face once a week
balls up with certain moisturizers
so moisturizers are hard for me.
the moisturizer does it's job
this is a very light moisturizer.
this is a very basic moisturizer with very basic ingredients
this is a good moisturizer
it was not the perfect moisturizer
this moisturizer was very lightweight-
this is a basic light moisturizer with no scent
i find i have better moisturizers that cost alot less
i usually just use a tinted moisturizer
i like the overnight rose sleep facial cream better
feels more like a day cream.
i will say however that it does a nice job of moisturizing in the summer
or if i use it with the moisturizer or not
it feels like sunscreen 2
many other moisturizers with spf that are better than this one
it has a very strong sunscreen smell.
it smell like sunscreen lotion
i wore this moisturizer so excitedly hoping my skin would benefit from it
this wasn't the best moisturizer out there
this is definitely mattifying
made my tinted moisturizer go on funny
does not dry skin like other creams.
additional moisturizer just sits on top of it
this is an okay cream
this cream is so greasy
it is the worst moisturizer i have ever tried.
this moisturizer balls up
this sunscreen was a little too greasey for my face
this eye cream is good
but the cream and soft cream are incredible!
i always wear waterproof mascara
had little to no effect on my mascaras
mascara this didn't take off
usually just some under eye concealer
this didn't come close to even taking off the concealer
let alone the non-waterproof mascara
much prefer the balm to this
waterproof mascara doesn't come off that easily
mascara all over my face
it doesn't do well taking off mascara
as far as eyeshadow
mascara/waterproof mascara go
does not take off mascara-
their eye creme is great.
this moisturizer is nice
i feel like its more of an spf instead of a moisturizer
this product is really more of a sunscreen.
lightweight moisturizer/sunscreen that would be great for someone under 40
this moisturizer did not absorb.
don't like thick creams
this moisturizer felt very greasy on my skin.
i really liked the texture of the lotion
what i really wanted was shiseido nutri-perfect night cream
it was the only moisturizer that she used because it was so rich
that moisturizer has been discontinued
please stop insisting i need sunscreen
this product may be a very good moisturizer
this lotion was too heavy for me
it's so creamy that i can't wear it under my make up because it would cause my eyeliner/mascara to run
too moisturizing to use in the day under concealer
to me this eye moisturizer is to be used at night only
it's more of a balm than a moisturizer.
i really like this cream
i am new to using eye creams
sensitive skin where i applied the cream
mascara will not hold
as little as i use my concealer runs
s down one of the best eye creams i've ever used
concealer looks greasy on those creases
i don't really like this moisturizer
i figured this moisturizer would be wonderful as well
the most disappointing part is that it doesn't moisturize at all
it's not the worst moisturizer
every face moisturize i have ever used includes sunblock
this lotion doesn't make my skin feel moisturized when i apply it
for the simple fact that i have a drug store moisturizer that works very well
i am definitely changing my moisturizer
this moisturizer never mattes my face.
s of mattefying lotion will feel cakey or pill up if i wipe my face
this moisturizer is good
i like the feel on this moisturizer
continue the search for a good moisturizer.
i cannot seem to dub this as a moisturizer as it simply does not moisturize
this moisturizer is light weight
it is a good moisturizer with a decent scent.
i kind of using it as a toner not a moisturizer
this is no better than drug store moisturizer
the moisturizer itself is great.
definitely not good enough to use as a moisturizer
as a regular moisturizer it is good
its a nice moisturizer, but not for me.
hunt down some ddf matte moisturizer
i really had high hopes for this moisturizer.
this moisturizer did nothing to help with matifying my skin
it is a nice lightweight moisturizer
i originally use murad moisturizer that helps mattify
i applied this moisturizer.
i recommend caudalie daily perfecting fluid if you want a moisturizer that helps with shine
i loved how this moisturizer mattified my skin.
this moisturizer is good.
just need a moisturizer that isn't my nicer moisturizers
purchased this for a light, summer moisturizer.
this moisturizer is nice
i mix this cream with my arcona sunscreen.
i wanted a lightweight moisturizer for summer.
i own the spy 18 brightening lotion for face
this cream was too
i used this as a daytime moisturizer instead because it just wasn't moisturizing enough for nighttime
i would not repurchase this moisturizer
i would consider this product as a good moisturizer
after a while i feel like it's not doing much work on hydrating nor working as a moisturizer
with the so little 15spf it's almost like wearing no sunblock either
i rather just bought a moisturizer
i do like this lotion
this moisturizer doesn't absorb well.
my foundation looks cakey with this moisturizer.
now i just use it as a mild day moisturizer.
don't recomend any of the sunscreen lines
the lotion is not to greasy for my skin
this moisturizer is more like makeup.
it gives you result like make up not a moisturizer
not for a daily moisturizer
you need to use moisturizer before it
it doesn't work well as a moisturizer
how can a moisturizer fail more?
wants to see if it's a better summer moisturizer
i mix it with another moisturizing lotion then apply it since it has spf 16
it's like putting on a tinted moisturizer.
sephora stopped carrying the non-spf white lucent moisturizer
their moisturizer is somewhat sticky
this one has a touch of sunscreen product
i give it 3 stars because it is a good moisturizer regardless
i usually like thick moisturizers
i like the cream
this is not the cream for you
i especially noticed this when i applied concealer after using this product
helped my concealer go on smoother
it's more of a moisturizer for under your eyes
just moisturizers, but that's it.
not a very good quality for morning skincare
this eye cream is ok
i only wear powder foundation
concealer on a few red spots
the gel was okay
i wear a non-waterproof mascara
it really feels like you're washing with a moisturizer
like to use tinted moisturizers as a foundations or a light coverage foundation
she told me this eye cream is light
especially since i wear waterproof eyeliner
this cream is nice
i like heavier creams under eyes like ysl.
this eye gel is not worth the $45.
the moisturisers in particular
it definitely does not moisturize the same
i'll have to go with a moisturizer in a jar where i can be sure to get all the cream i paid for
this is a nice moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer
plus it's almost impossible to actually use the last of the lotion in the bottle
it feels like a lotion
no matter how much moisturizer i used
every single time i put my moisturizer on it flakes
the product flakes right off when i apply lotion
the bottle says you can use makeup or lotion over
this product also peels whenever you try to apply a moisturizer
it tends to "pill" if you try to wear it under foundation or with lotion
didn't play well with my moisturizer
the exfoliation i got from this product was alright
this was the best exfoliate i had ever found
take a deep breath moisturizer
it's just a simple moisturizer
when a facial lotion gets to this price range
it appeared to not moisturize my skin almost at all
this moisturizer left my skin feeling a little on the dry side
wanted to try a moisturizer with antioxidants after reading about how it might help my breakouts
i stopped using the moisturizer for a few nights
i chose this particular moisturizer because clinique is supposed to be fragance free
plus i liked ththat this moisturizer does not comes in jar packaging
i chose this particular moisturizer because clinique is supposed to be fragance free
plus i liked ththat this moisturizer does not comes in jar packaging
i would use this as a moisturizer in combination with "active" serums if i thought it warranted the price tag
this cream is very heavy
i did not care for this moisturizer at all.
my hunt for for good winter moisturizer continues
this is the second time i have bought a moisturizer or product from them
this is great if you do not wear any under eye concealer
this will make you concealer st
i wanted something lightweight that would still moisturize my skin
this moisturizer was recommended to me to use along with the fresh clay toner
it is the worst moisturizer i have used in terms of causing my foundation to "pill"
this moisturizer was a headache to use on a daily basis
still searching for that moisturizer for oily skin :
this lotion made me even more oily than i already am
i really liked the lightweight feeling of the fresh umbrian clay lotion
oil-free moisturizer for you normal to oily skin i would recommend trying it
this moisturizer really did nothing special for my skin
if i'm spending that much money on a moisturizer
now i'm on the hunt for that perfect moisturizer for combination oily
it's one of the worst moisturizers i've ever used
bought this instead of my usual soy moisturizer
that being said this moisturizer goes on fine
the lotion itself was fine on my skin
this moisturizer started out well enough
trying to find my skins perfect moisturizer
so thought fresh moisturizer would do the trick to combat shine
i really enjoyed the scent of this moisturizer
i love the feeling of this moisturizer.
had to try this moisturizer
odd since this is supposed to be a calming moisturizer
when i tried this lotion all over my face
better than the day cream with spf30
will finish the container mixed with another moisturizer
the dramatically different moisturizing cream in hopes that my problem would go away
while it was great to put on under or over moisturizer in terms of texture
it is more lotion than gel- feels like a face moisturizer
it seems like the lotion-y "gel" just moisturizes the skin instead of actually doing anything
all it seems to be is a thick lotion
i recommend you read about hydroquinone before you buy this product
normally if i use a moisturizer like this
it's a good night moisturizer
why do beauty companies need to scent moisturizers?
this lotion did nothing all that amazing
it didn't do anything other than moisturize.
otherwise it's not a bad moisturizer
it's not any more potent than any other moisturizer i've used
my search for a good moisturizer for night use will continue
truly i prefer the "radiance serum" to the night correcting cream
this cream is not for me.
i take vitamins, dont smoke and use sunscreen.
this is a nice night time moisturizer.
the only positive is that i do think it was slightly moisturizing
except act as a moisturizer
ptr's un-wrinkle night is an average preventative moisturizer
don't let conditioner get on my back
if you want a lightweight gel moisturizer for oily skin you have found it
while it was a really nice moisturizer
then use redness solution moisturizer after
this was like rubbing body lotion on your face
mascara was still on
definitely didn't take off my mascara
feels like straight up lotion on your face.
it feels like i'm just smearing a moisturizer on my face
it seems to be more of a wipe off moisturizer
i like to switch up my moisturizers every so often
i'd give it 5 stars if it were just a moisturizer
i would not recommend this moisturizer for redness correction
i didn't really see a change in the redness on my face after switching from a much cheaper cerave moisturizer
this lotion is pretty thick
it doesn't really work great as a moisturizer either
clinique redness solutions is a decent moisturizer
plus this cream is not greasy
try to use it up as a moisturizer
this product is fine as a moisturizer
i ended up purchasing a heavy duty moisturizer that worked better
i think this eye cream is ok as a moisturizer for the eye area
i love that u can add the powder to any moisturizers
s when you mix it with your serum or moisturizer though is horrible
idk if it might be the moisturizer that i am mixing it with
sunscreen of foundation with spf
i tried it with my moisturizer
my moisturizer is expensive
mixed this with my moisturizer for about a month in a half
it makes my moisturizer sticky
it didn't mix we'll with my moisturizer.
i added this to my am moisturizer
it starts repelling my sunscreen （i have used the same sunscreen product for years
if i use this product with my sunscreen with this powder
moisturizer i use requires a very small amount
into my serum or moisturizer
bought mostly for eye moisturizer
the flaking makes applying concealer difficult
pull out my concealer when i need coverage
skincare can only do so much
i do like the cream
concealer goes on smoother
my concealer would get into my fine lines more
atleast i could hide my dark circles with concealer
this was not enough moisturizer for me
if i wanted a moisturizer for my under eyes id opt for something less pricey
there is really nothing amazing about this product just an average slightly moisturizing cream
this cream is neither very moisturizing nor does it brighten at all
this cream is not it
this cream is not for me
my skin doesn't seem to be getting along with this moisturizer
had re-purchased this product twice thinking it was an amazing moisturizer
didn't realize until i tried out another moisturizer that this barely hydrates the skin
when i tried the new product my skin felt 1000x better than this moisturizer ever did
this is the worst moisturizer ever!
it's not really a good moisturizer if you have very dry skin
this lotion made my skin feel sticky
the moisturizer is very light weight
the only way this product works for me is if i use it as a 5 minute moisturizing mask
a more moisturizing effect could be obtained with drugstore moisturizers
this moisturizer was a bit too light for me
the gel-cream feels great during application
it still would pile on my skin because of this moisturizer
this moisturizer left me dryer than ever
onto the next moisturizer :(
now i look for moisturizer without dimethicone
this would probably work for me as a daytime summer moisturizer
i now just use aloe gel on my face.
while this is a good moisturizer
it was the perfect moisturizer for my skin
this is not the moisturizer for me.
this is a great nighttime moisturizer
this moisturizer is fine
so keep that in mind before using this moisturizer
it is definitely this moisturizer
anti-aging moisturizer i could use during the day with or without makeup
it does not mix well with my bb creams/foundations
i got a sample of this moisturizer during the winter months
this is a great moisturizer if you have problems with dry skin
this moisturizer was fine for a few days
i've never had that problem with any other moisturizer
i ordered this moisturizer online
there are a million moisturizers out there
while this moisturizer is rich
anyway, this lotion is okay?
silky-would be a great daytime moisturizer
this moisturizer does not absorb into my skin at all
i love the texture of the moisturizer
this moisturizer leaves a film
i will probably not use this moisturizer again.
i needed a good nighttime moisturizer that would work in the day too
it is a decent moisturizer
am using a different moisturizer now
i like the face finishing cream
the texture is too oily to really be a useful under eye moisturizer
most eye cream do that
will just stick with a cheaper under-eye moisturizer
it was a great moisturizer and that is about it.
do like his cleaner and moisturizer.
the "cream-lotion" takes quite a while to absorb.
not any more than other moisturizers
the benefits from this moisturizer did not justify spending this much on a moisturizer
i swear this cream does nothing for my skin.
use face finishing moisturizer instead
i wanted a more luxurious skincare line since i'm approaching my mid 30's
the feel of this moisturizer instantly
i swear this cream made my skin worse
i love the way this moisturizer makes my skin feel
asked for a moisturizer that is organic for super dry skin
i'd prefer using one with spf for a day cream
i will try the night cream, same brand.
i didn't feel any great benefit to my skin from this moisturizer
in contrast with using hope in a jar or other high-performance moisturizers which would leave my skin plumped
this cream made my skin more oily
i really wanted to love this moisturizer.
just wasn't the daily moisturizer i was seeking
this moisturizer is okay.
it is a very heavy moisturizer
it is a thicker moisturizer.
go for mattifying cream.
i need an oil-free moisturizer for daytime use.
there are many amazing moisturizers out there
it has no sunscreen which is the #1 protectant you need for your skin
you could layer spf on top of this cream
heavy to be a morning moisturizer for me
i got a smaller size of this moisturizer in a sephora favorites
wish this cream had spf
overall, just an ok moisturizer.
this moisturizer left a film on my face
even though i'm oily i still feel like this does nothing to moisturise me
this moisturizer has shea
this moisturizer should suit you just fine
i spent a long time in sephora recently weighing options for natural moisturizer that was free of salicylic acid
this is a good moisturizer
i got the facial moisturizer from first aid beauty instead
it's a much better sunscreen than most drug store br
this gel cream moisturizer is decent
it seems to work just as a good moisturizer
it felt like lotion
since it's double the price of my old moisturizer
this cream kept my skin matte for about 30 minutes
i tried this as a daytime moisturizer
i would not use this as my only method of moisturizer
i still wear moisturizer
which is not what most moisturizers do
this moisturizer was just okay
this cream left my skin really dry
it is a great creamy moisturizer that feels sooo good
it's like putting moisturizer on your face
moisturizers at the same time
secondly i do not ever wear waterproof mascara
it didn't even touch my mascara
i used it under my moisturizer it works
i moisturize before i do my makeup
i've tried it at night and under my moisturizer .
got a sample of a really great moisturizer
the next morning i used this new moisturizer over the serum
flakey even after exfoliating every few days
i tried layering different moisturizers on different occasions
i used it with the moisturizer from the same line
with other moisturizers on top
perfect under night cream
following immediately with my moisturizer
my skin was still dry after application followed by moisturizer
usually i have no problem spending money on skincare
non "sunscreen feeling" moisturizer which was what i was going for
it smells like sunscreen
looks like sunscreen both in the container
this is one moisturizer i hate
i am now on the hunt for a new moisturizer
clinique has changed the formula of the moisturizer i have used for years
the new formula smells like sunscreen
found it to be the first moisturizer for my mature combination skin that didn't cause my skin to breakout
cannot use this moisturizer with it
it smells like sunscreen when you put it on
not a huge fan of the sunscreen smell
or i would just wear sunscreen each day
none of my previous moisturizers smelled that strongly of sunscreen
while the lotion is light
it definitely leaves the smell of sunblock behind
this is a very nice moisturizer
after i apply this moisturizer
figured i'd look for a lightweight clinique moisturizer with spf
that sheen that an actual sunscreen gives
i like the lotion overall
otherwise it's a good lotion.
it's much better than most creams with spf
i don't have this problem with other moisturizers
while the moisturizer hasn't broken out my skin
for something that is suppose to be super moisturizing i'm disappointed
if you read about this product it says this moisturizer helps neutralize uva
i still need to buy something to put on top of this moisturizer to help me to protect my skin
this eye cream was okay.
this moisturizer is strange
needed to replace my moisturizer
i also agree that it time to upgrade to a moisturizer for oily skin
the youth surge moisturizer
this was the best face cream ever
definitely test this moisturizer on a small patch of skin first
at the counter i was amazed at how moisturizing
this was the first moisturizer i tried
i decided to try this moisturizer
it would be a great light weight or summer moisturizer for women under 30
looks like i haven't put any moisturizer on
i did not like this moisturizer.
would be a good moisturizer during the summer
first of all, it stinks like a sunscreen.
i've used this moisturizer for about a year now
i wanted a moisturizer with a higher spf
that i'm going to have to use two moisturizers or something
don't care for the sunscreen smell
i've never use an anti-age moisturizer before
the smell of sunscreen is something i cannot get used to
i would give it 4 stars for its ability to moisturize
this moisturizer wasn't for me.
horrible results with concealer
this product is more of a moisturizer
this one feels like i'm paying for a regular lotion that is super expensive
this is one of the worst eye creams i ever tried
this "mattifying moisturizer " had made me look line a greasy clown
it is not mattifying at all
it is the consistency of thick sunblock
over the summer i had purchased this moisturizer
i'd apply this before my makeup as an everyday moisturizer
first off, i hate how liquidy this lotion is.
this moisturizer did help with my oiliness.
the moisturizer is quite thick
i found that either this moisturizer or the acne face cleanser from murad made my skin texture like s
still in search for a good oil control moisturizer
it felt like i was putting sunscreen on.
-alone moisturizer as i don't like to have an spf in my moisturizer as it decreases the other benefits
i don't really like moisturizer.
my makeup stuck to this lotion
but, i needed a true anti- wrinkle cream.
it is a good moisturizer
while this is a decent product i have used better night creams
am very interested in finding good anti-wrinkle creams
i've noticed that it doesn't seem to plump out my wrinkles if i am using under eye concealer
i try all of these eye creams
this product has made it so that whatever moisturizing cream i try to causes my skin in the eye area to burn
the lotion is harsh on my skin.
feels like alcohol on raw skin when i apply my usual lotion
first time i used this cream my skin started to peel
putting on plenty of moisturizer
this is one of those light weight moisturizer that doesn't leave your face greasy
this moisturizer made my t-zone even more oily.
though i like her retin-a cream
as a versatile use moisturizer
so all good there- perfect weight moisturizer.
i'll pay for good moisturizers
asked for a moisturizer for sensitive
this is great for my night time routine because i like to use a lot of moisturizer
when i started using this moisturizer
the moisturizer itself is great.
this is such a beautiful moisturizer
went back to my kiehls moisturizer
i heard such wonderful things about this moisturizer
it smells much better than almost all moisturizers i have tried
my skin just isn't getting the moisture is needs from this lotion
kate somerville's nourish daily moisturizer is definitely not for me
one woman brought this nourish daily moisturizer along with kate somerville's quench
rarely have a problem with any moisturizer
just not enough moisture in this moisturizer
i didn't think this moisturizer was lightweight at all
i'll use it as a nightime moisturizer until i use it up
attempted to use this as a daily face moisturizer
moisturizer for what seems like an eternity
grabbing the moisturizer my skin was tight
which means that i need more moisturizer
an oil free moisturizer
what kind of skincare line is this!
my favorite part of this moisturizer is the packaging
so at first touch i was in love with this moisturizer
this is one of the few moisturizers that doesn't break me out
it didn't moisturizer my face either
as many moisturizers are just too heavy for me
for such a pricey moisturizer
this moisturizer leaves my skin very dry
i decided to switch the other moisturizer for this one hoping to get more moisture
i enjoyed this moisturizer.
this moisturizer was advertised for oily skin.
this moisturizer kept my oily skin at bay.
i like this moisturizer
there are other moisturizers that are also good
if the price of this moisturizer was
wish i could love this moisturizer!!
this doesn't even feel like lotion
i think there are better moisturizers out on the market
go with another moisturizer
if i put powder on my face after the moisturizer
i'll go back to using a gel moisturizer which i would recommend for combo/oily skin
my skin does better with gel
this moisturizer is not one of them.
this moisturizer provided no moisture for my skin
had to wear another moisturizer on top of this to calm my skin
this product did the complete opposite of moisturizer my face
this is a lightweight moisturizer that goes on smoothly
all i wanted was a gentle oil-free moisturizer
was constantly looking around for new moisturizers
i like how it dispenses the moisturizer in a contained fashion
this lotion is too intense
i did use a moisturizer on top of this product
this lotion is something else.
is that anything that touches this lotion
this lotion did nothing for my skin.
back to proactiv lotion it is!
while the moisturizer did not upset my sensitive skin
the moisturizer was very thin
i love this moisturizer.
it felt as if a layer of moisturizer was just sitting on top of my skin
a perfect amount of lotion comes out
this lotion is nice
this lotion felt nice going on
this is an average moisturizer.
is just a average moisturizer, nothing special.
i actually received this moisturizer as a gift
it might be a great moisturizer for some
didn't really moisturize my face all that well
this moisturizer was really disappointing
it makes traveling with it ridiculous considering it's only 1oz of moisturizer
go back to my origins make a different plus moisturizer
this moisturizer made me break out
i love kate's tan pads for the face
i know with new moisturizer
used it as a serum before ole moisturizer after clenser
i say go with a lower priced, basic moisturizer
do you really want to pay that much for scented lotion?
i eventually tried a new moisturizer for $60 for 1
decided to try her eye creams
there are better serums out there actually with potent vitamins
especially with a formula that doesn't make my skin breakout due to the oils in the lotion nor make my face look like i just fut a coat of urethane on it
although this removed my sunscreen
bb cream well it did not remove my water proof mascara
i only had on a bit of concealer
it's a great moisturizer if you can get past the smell
if you want a very light moisturizer
i'd recommend this moisturizer for those with dry skin
*sad face* i will stick with my effective $6 moisturizer
i love the feel of this gel formula.
this is a good oil free moisturizer for those of us with with oily skin
for some reason i thought this was going to be more of a moisturizing serum
it gets very dry even with moisturizer
making it look less smooth when i apply concealer
applied this product followed by the moisturizer from this line
as i'm assuming retinol is just too strong for my skin
when i try to put moisturizer on for the flakiness
otherwise it's a fair moisturizer
have to put moisturizer on top
i think its best for oily skin for mattifying the skin purposes
i think i'll just stick with the exfoliating scrub when i need a bit of a boost
terrible breakouts everytime i go back to this moisturizer trying to finish this expensive bottle
this cream made my skin break out
i used this as my moisturizer for 3 months
i think my biggest mistake with this moisturizer is that i trusted it to be my every need moisturizer
doesn't do anything for antiaging
needing to get a moisturizer quickly
i much prefer nude's advanced renewal moisturizer
will not be added to my daily beauty regimen
it feels thick like suntan lotion
caudalie's premier cru is a fantastic moisturizer
this moisturizer is too pricey not to live up to its claims
i definitely prefer to use just the finishing moisturizer
i absolutely love this moisturizer !!
another failed spf moisturizer for me.
like every other spf moisturizer i've tried
i didn't find this moisturizer evened out my skin tone at all
i made sure that the serum had plenty of time to be absorbed before adding the moisturizer
i went back to using the yellow moisturizer after the serum
i think my main purpose is best to just keep my skin moisturizer
i don't like the greasy feeling of the sunscreen
it is a great moisturizer, but gets oily quickly.
way too expensive for just a moisturizer.
this moisturizer is too heavy and greasy.
i can only use it as a night moisturizer
it is great as a daily moisturizer with spf
finally a moisturizer that has no "shininess"
most lotions/moisturizers are way too heavy
it wasent this moisturizer made me break out
it's a great moisturizer though.
as a moisturizer it is rich
in the morning if i end up using concealer
provide smooth canvas for applying concealer
also leaves a tacky-peely kind of residue that is impossible to apply concealer over
i like that this eye cream is a cream gel
i've had better luck with eye creams from the drugstore
try the nude skincare eye cream.
worked on my tarte waterproof mascara
i love the fab moisturizer
from the eyeliner/mascara
especially mascara which i always have trouble with
as far as eye creams go
easy to use under moisturizer
so this moisturizer has to go
that's the only time i'll use this lotion
this moisturizer is very thick
i love the fact that it's unscented because i hate moisturizers with strong fragrances
this moisturizer clings to it
a sephora sales girl recommended this to me as a face moisturizer
when the sales person put this anti-redness serum/lotion on my h
thta's what i want for a summer lotion
is overall an okay moisturizer
i won't be buying this again as a facial moisturizer
it was more like a lotion than a serum
i went back to using the regular serum/moisturizer
still searching for a lightweight serum to use daily under sunscreen in the morning
this is much more of a lotion than a cream.
while this worked ok as just a moisturizer in general
returned it because i already have plenty of moisturizers
its just a white lotion.
started applying this before moisturizer
i can't use moisturizer when i use this because it basically replaces it
unfortunately i haven't noticed any benefits to adding this serum to my skincare regimen
this serum did not work for my skin
it does feel more like a moisturizer rather than serum
and it feels more like a moisturizer.
it acts like a very light moisturizer.
the consistency puts it more in the moisturizer category for me
i would say it's only an "ok" moisturizer at best
works well with my moisturizer and my foundation.
it is a thin lotion.
goes on like a moisturizer
this has a consistency like a lotion.
it is a good moisturizer
i really like this product as a moisturizer.
without my night moisturizer
i saw no mattifying from this lotion at all.
there is no mattifying
but overall, it was ok- moisturizer.
i recommend using a regular sun-block lotion
it does a good job cleansing the sunscreen off.
i wear waterproof mascara
it didn't really control my oily skin any more than the twelve dollar mattifying moisturizer i buy from the drug store
this is a great moisturizer for ladies with oily skin
i don't like this lotion at all.
i agree that adding a light moisturizer over this makes skin feel better
i tried this moisturizer
for the price i was very disappointed in this moisturizer
this lotion is probably effective for those with moderately oily skin
this lotion is a great moisturizer however my face still gets very oily
bought this lotion thinking all br
continuing with the search for a great moisturizer
felt sticky for quite after applying the moisturizer
stick with my perricone face finishing moisturizer
after applying this moisturizer
non greasy day moisturizer that will work with my combination skin for a while now
i would prefer to use the lotus moisturizer over this one
for the price of this moisturizer
this moisturizer made my skin look horrible.
this moisturizer made my skin look horrible.
if i'm paying a little extra for a moisturizer
i would like this moisturizer - if it was summer.
i don't feel its enough moisturizer for winter dry skin
it left my eyeliner
i don't use waterproof mascara
i do wear a good layer of foundation powder bronzer blush everyday
non-waterproof mascara on a daily basis
seemed to break up my mascara
does not remove my waterproof mascara
second, when i used concealer, the serum flaked.
the consistency is that of a lotion
i like the lotion itself.
for my oily ladies who like a little weight to their daytime moisturizer
whenever i use a lightweight moisturizer like this one before i start my day
this moisturizer was recommended to me at my home location as an oily skin remedy
even though this moisturizer is for sensitive skin
i love the moisturizer
i wish i would've bought a more intense hydrating one
i think so far it does a good job at moisturizing my skin
i prefer a much richer feel to moisturizer
seemed like a perfect daytime moisturizer.
great night moisturizer just not great for oily skin
this moisturizer was recommended to me after loving the daily face moisturizer
purchased my daily face moisturizer instead
my skin wouldnt absorb the lotion
i love this moisturizer.
the only thing that helps is concealer
i still wanted an on-the-go eye moisturizer
my previous favorite eye gel
i'd always use a eye moisturizer after this.
it didn't seem to moisturise at all, either.
it's more like a lotion.
maybe you need that toner lotion type stuff for it to show any results of value
thick enough that i don't need another moisturizer at times
it's not a bad moisturizer
this cream is not greasy
just average moisturizer in a heavy glass jar.
this creme made my skin feel kind of gross
not only did this cream not moisturize my skin at all
this is a nice light moisturizer that absorbs well
concealer applies over the top of it with only minimal creasing
i ended up using a concealer brush to apply this.
i found that after applying the eye creme
it ruins my concealer
dior worked their magic by plumping up those wrinkles
less expensive eye creams
if you want a light eye moisturizer
it does not pill up under my concealer
this cream has it
eye creams in general are very expensiveso when i found dior
i can use my face moisturizer for that
i don't believe all the hype about eye creams
i love this eye cream
best bet is to find creams without the alcohol.
or just want to mix a few cover fx drops in for a tinted moisturizer only look
this moisturizer falls flat
but this moisturizer amped up the oil.
i needed a moisturizer with an spf since acne cleansers are a bit harsher on the skin
it's always suggested to walk outside with a sunscreen
better off buying a gentile drugstore moisturizer with spf
it is a nice moisturizer besides that though
this would be a great day moisturizer for dry skin types
i'd been wearing fab's body lotion on my face
i really wanted to like this moisturizer
switched back to my previous moisturizer
r might just be the greaaasiest moisturizer i have ever used
this moisturizer claims to do a lot!
i much prefer the paulas choice spf 30 moisturizer
asked for an anti-aging moisturizer
other first aid products were awesome just not the moisturizer
ran out of my moisturizer
it felt like a layer of sunblock over my skin
use a lighter moisturizer before putting on makeup
picked up a different daily moisturizer from another br
i mean everything from eyebrow pencil to eyeliner to mascara
this lotion is too greasy for me.
i am allergic to the sunscreen in the product
bought this for the sunscreen
as a sunscreen this works fine
i prefer a lotion that absorbs and is matte.
a good moisturizer for dry skin with an spf protection
this moisturizer is just ok.
overall if you want a lightweight moisturizer for nighttime this will work just fine
spending so much money on a moisturizer
i tried to like this moisturizer
i really liked this lotion at first
there's much better moisturizers out there
i really wanted to like this moisturizer
moisturizer it just made my face dry
it can not be called a moisturizer 2
this moisturizer is ok.
thought this moisturizer would be perfect for me
i find that pure vitamin e oil is a better moisturizer than this mess
i like everything but this moisturizer.
i didn't love this moisturizer.
the moisturizer just don't work
the oil-free moisturizer with spf15 broke me out.
this moisturizer smells like bad cheap plastic.
with the matching moisturizer
if you don't have acne prone skin this would probably be a good creamy cleanser for you
suggest a moisturizer that is not so light
it's a really nice moisturizer
i prefer lighter feeling moisturizers
this lotion felt nice
this works fine as a moisturizer
this is a good moisturizer
this was a nice moisturizer.
this moisturizer did help with my acne the first few days
meaning i have to use moisturizer with it
this seemed like a great addition to my skincare routine
i love the moisturizer that comes in the blue labeled bottle though
i even need put another layer moisturizer on my face
i blend it with my moisturizer before applying
in reality, it's just a good moisturizer.
i put on moisturizer after
was really excited about this moisturizer
for combo or oily complexions there are other day creams that are much better
i wanted a day cream with spf
i didn't get much of a "sunscreen smell" from it
i'll keep using my spf 15 makeup over my moisturizer
i wouldn't mind a sunscreen smell
i dislike this moisturizer.
has the consistency of sunscreen
this was just not the right moisturizer for me.
i like the sheer transformation moisturizer much better
this moisturizer is pretty rich
it gives a strong sunscreen feel to the skin
wouldn't feel like a sunscreen
smells like sunscreen on face
maybe it is the sunscreen...
i found this cream very heavy
i prefer a much lighter day cream
the sunscreen gets in my eyes
this is one of the very best skin creams i have ever used
my main concern when choosing a moisturizer is that it is moisturizing enough for my dry skin
while i love the idea of spf in my moisturizer
the presence of sunscreen makes this feel really heavy
think old-school sunscreen
good for a heavier winter creme.
maybe because of the sunscreen
this particular creme made my face greasy
i love this moisturizer
cheap sunblock on your face
i applied this serum in the mornings before applying makeup
i now use this as a eye cream
use a good sunscreen every day
then my concealer settled in the lines
it glides on like a primer providing a good base for my sunscreen
switched back to my regular moisturizer
this moisturizer is amazing!
this moisturizer was very harsh on my skin.
the cream did go on like silk
did a mediocre/average job of moisturizing
it's an average face cream.
liked it as a moisturizer though.
it is a nice moisturizer
i don't feel that my face is as dewy as it is with other creams
cream on my face
this has the consistency of lotion
this cream is light
thought i'd give the moisturizer a try
however i love bb's extra rich moisturizer.
using my regular moisturizer
it is no substitute for a proper moisturizer in the winter for my skin
while it did a great job of moisturizing my skin it also left me with little pimples in the morning
feels like putting regular drugstore lotion on your face
i prefer it as a night time moisturizer.
just a real expensive moisturizer.
it was just an ok moisturizer
they recommended this cream to me
it's ok as a moisturizer.
this is an alright moisturizer
this product does it's job as a moisturizer.
this was a good moisturizer.
a bobbi brown mua recommended this moisturizer as a must-have for use under foundation
it definitely doesn't lay very well under concealer
the only thing this product does is moisturize under your eyes
“can an eye lotion only have a few ingredients”?
no different than if i used a regular moisturizer
my facial moisturizer could provide the same
concealer line with this eye cream
it is a good base for concealer
i like creams that are easy to apply
did not find this product any more hydrating than my usual under makeup eye or facial moisturizer
that you apply an eye cream before eye concealer
i like this eye cream
it's just a regular moisturizer capitalizing on the bobbi brown name
made my concealer look even worse
i tried this hoping it was a good sunscreen for my face
by mid day it was burning as most sunscreens do for me
i love their non sunscreen products
the lotion was not protective for me
the protective face lotion used to have sunscreen in it
was eager to try this protective face lotion as all sunblocks seem to break me out
i love it as a moisturizer
ing of this is it's a moisturizer/primer
i love this for a day moisturizer right now
i think you can even use it as a daily moisturizer
the product feels great as a moisturizer
as you all know this is a moisturizer
to me it is your average primer/moisturizer
does not have sunscreen for undereye area
lamer's eye creams are great
may have to try the extra moisturizer eye cream instead of this one
i wish i had just stayed with bb's original hydrating eye cream
the concealer glides on just fine
this cream seems to help my concealer stay on a bit longer before it starts to crease
the slightest touch made the product/moisturizer ball up
mix in with moisturizer
i put moisturizer on top of the gel
absolutely no chance that this would work with any concealer or moisturizer
don't put moisturizer on afterwards
why put this in a moisturizer meant to soothe??
i prefer lighter weight moisturizers.
it seemed to work just like any other moisturizer i've used
feels like the cheap moisturizer you get a hotels
for reference i use clinique’s gel moisturizer
needed a light moisturizer for the summer
this moisturizer broke me out
i loved the way the moisturizer felt on my skin
the moisturizer for the birthday gift
it works as a moisturizer
on it's own the moisturizer is ok
i mix this moisturizer with another one i have
this is a fine moisturizer
it felt like any other moisturizer
which is why i wanted to purchase this moisturizer
not only this moisturizer does not moisturize at all
i tried it one night instead of my regular moisturizer
doesn't sting which i find most of these "gel like" moisturizers to do
this just isn't the moisturizer for me
this is definitely a lightweight moisturizer
the lotion was lightweight
you get the moisturizing feel when you first apply it
a sunscreen & anti-aging product in one.
it also smell a bit like sunscreen
did this lotion help protect me against the sun or moisturize my skin?
many sunscreens make me break out
it does look, feel, and smell like sunscreen.
feels like yucky sunscreen
i didn't see any results other than moisturizing
i didn't see any results from this other than a moisturizing sunscreen
i can't say whether this sunscreen has any antiaging action
much more so than other sunscreens
what i will say is that it did moisturize
workong my way through each eye cream/gel to find the best one
using this product made my under eye concealer very sticky
it makes it almost impossible to use under eye concealer effectively
it works as a day moisturizer
this moisturizer sure does give me that "instant" hydration
this moisturizer works well on my dry h
feels nice as a moisturizer
this moisturizer was great for making my skin soft
this is a wonderful moisturizer especially for fall
this just like any typical sephora skincare product in my opinion
when i put makeup over the moisturizer
this replaced a water based moisturizer that was amazing
this moisturizer made my skin much more dry than it was before
i used this moisturizer for years
after bare minerals raised the price on their daily moisturizer
this moisturizer was a disappointment.
i hate this eye cream
this eye cream is the worst cream in my eye cream history
i love this eye cream
you're better to buy something with retinol in it
the concealer had worn off
pretty much just a really expensive eye moisturizer
it's basically a thin moisturizer.
my concealer creases a lot over it
after a month of use i felt that it wasn't working specially for moisturizer
concealer hasn't creased once
the product is a wonderful moisturizer
all in all this is just a lightweight moisturizer wouldn't waste $99 on it
another reviewer stated this product isn't moisturizing as an eye cream is expected to be
this moisturizer is horrible on my skin it's super heavy
just a typical daily moisturizer with spf
it doesn't have that sticky feeling most moisturizers have
this moisturizer starts out thick
it makes my concealer crease
i've bought myself a very expensive moisturizer.
the 24 night lotion is wonderful.
maybe it's the sunscreen that caused that
i've read that you don't need eye cream/gel
just use the moisturizer you have
i'd rather spend the money on serum to use under the moisturizer
bought this eye cream because i loved their moisture bound moisturizer
i would not repurchase again unless i only want a great gel eye moisturizer
it does moisturize my eye area, but this is it.
this is a fabulous eye cream.
the texture is more like a lotion
not really a gel or cream
although this moisturizer is expensive
i'd say this is not a moisturizer
i need to put another moisturizer over top of it
it was my favourite moisturizer
i do not like moisturizers to be perfumed
actually really mad at this product because i have never found a face moisturizer with a great texture it is like a creme gel formula really lightweight i used some samples i got from sephora
on the list it does not say no synthetic fragrances so yeahh you do get a great moisturizer
le i hope to find another moisturizer that helps my skin like this did without the perfume
it is like a thin lotion
if you want a good moisturizer
the only thing i did about it was exfoliate
i used this product under take a deep breath moisturizer
im assuming good moisturizers
is this a cream or a lotion???
forget the expensive wrinkle creams
it was more like a $175 moisturizer.
the moisturizer works well.
it was a different moisturizer
i returned this pricey moisturizer.
it has the benefits of an anti-moisturizer as well
algenist anti-aging moisturizer i do not recommend
my skin definitely didn't like this moisturizer
i am very careful with my use of moisturizers.
which moisturizer would be better for me to use?
i really do not like this moisturizer at all
is it possible for a moisturizer to make fine lines
while its a good moisturizer
i gave it two stars because it is a good moisturizer
seems to be a decent moisturizer
this one does not moisturize enough at all.
the scent was stronger than my normal go-to moisturizer
i am still on the hunt for the right moisturizer.
it feels as if sunscreen is in my eyes!
i needed the algenist moisturizer
the saleswoman told me i should use the new moisturizer with the spf
he says this algenist anti-aging moisturizer spf 20 is too greasy
doesnt cause makeup to get cakey
i returned it because i personally don't want to spend $80 for a concealer primer
you should definitely add another hydrating cream for the under eye area after using this
this eye cream definitely moisturizes your under eye
it was okay under concealer.
it's a good primer for my concealer
this is a nice moisturizer
this was a decent moisturizer at best.
eye creams are expensive
this cream is nice
this is a fine eye cream
not the best eye cream i've ever used
you could get an eye cream from the drugstore if all you want is average moisturization
i even tried blending with moisturizer
with moisturizer doesn't do as well
i did not have any issues applying concealer
when you add moisturizer
concealer or any kind of makeup on
you have to use it in conjunction with a moisturizer
this is nothing more that a bad concealer.
the white residue could not be hidden with moisturizer or concealer
i decided to try it again underneath my tinted moisturizer
if you add eye cream or put your concealer
if i put concealer over it
makes my concealer look bad
so while this products actually gets rid of the bags i can't use it with concealer
once you put o moisturizer 7 minutes later it is not effective
this is really mattifying
in fact it just made my mascara stick to my eyelashes by creating a gloopy mascara residue
i needed a day time moisturizer that goes on after toner
"i don't eat my moisturizer"
i used this solely as a moisturizer.
i wanted a moisturizer with spf since i have very fair skin
i don't eat my moisturizer
wanted to try a daytime lotion with spf
my face looks greasier with this lotion on
around the same time i started using this lotion
going bare with this moisturizer makes it oily looking
much rather try out other moisturizers than splurge $30 for this whatevers moisturizer
this lotion actually made me breakout all over my face
just use it as a sunblock when i don't need heavy protection
i don't agree with those who think that this lotion is lightweight
it is supposed to be a oil free lotion
no wow factor about this moisturizer at all.
which i don't like for morning moisturizers
t soft as other moisturizers do [like clinique for example]
you could get a better moisturizer with spf in it
i only keep using it for the sunscreen
the lotion felt thick
pretty thick moisturizer that goes on nicely
it is a good moisturizer for maybe younger people or if you have a nice serum with antioxidants/ anti-aging this would go well
wish they made the moisturizer as a body lotion instead
greasiest moisturizer i have ever had the misfortune of using
you'll get all the positive benefits from this moisturizer
i couldn't get past the strong fragrance to decide if i liked the formula of the moisturizer itself
i love how this moisturizer works
really really wanted to like this moisturizer
this moisturizer did absolutely nothing for my skin
s of night moisturizers that are equally nice
i wanted a basic cream for my face
i found nothing really special about this facial cream
it is an amazing thickness for a night cream
it really is a great moisturizer
this facial cream got great reviews
it reminded me of a very cheap body lotion.
it did moisturizer skin around my eyes
skin had to be supplemented with another moisturizer because it was drying
can buy a better eye cream
it is a good moisturizer for dryer skins
although i will say this stuff is great for moisturizing
do not use this eye cream
this cream also doesn't have any spf
it did not firm, brighten, or moisturize.
especially right after i applied the cream
this eye cream is okay.
sometimes this eye crème makes my eyes water
besides that its good for nighttime as a moisturizer under the eyes
i got this eye cream
didn't smudge my eyeliner or mascara
this is an okay moisturizer
i need a much heavier moisturizer
this moisturizer isn't heavy
it feels like a matte moisturizer
finding the right moisturizer for 50 year old skin isn't easy
this moisturizer will be nice for the warmer weather
not even two coats of moisturizer
it feels like an expensive moisturizer on my skin
rolls off when i apply concealer
wish kate could fix this product so that it would stay put under concealer
then applied concealer with concealer brush
it didn't even seem to moisturize the area i applied it
i would say it is on par with using a regular ole henriksen face moisturizer as an eye cream
all this one does is moisturize the eye area
it would make my concealer look dull
this eye cream is just okay
i feel i look good for my age plus wear sunscreen
it doesn't do much aside from moisturize
i gave it two stars cause it does sorta moisturize
i wouldn't recommend this cream
went back to the jojoba exfoliator which i've always loved
guess i'll use it as body serum/lotion
you can definitely smell the spf in this eye cream
best thing about it is that it does have sunscreen protection
i did like that the eye cream had spf
it was the eye cream
it makes my under eye concealer crease
i would love to find a good eye cream that has spf
i figured this would be similar except more moisturizing
the sunblock used really irritates my eyes
went in thinking this would be a great moisturizer for under my eyes
i like the idea of spf in my eye cream
this creme is almost hard
the sunscreen in this is unstable
more about the sunscreen ingredients-- octinoxate isn't very stable on it's own
didn't do anything but moisturize!
this is a great moisturizer
really wanted a sunscreen in my eye cream
the eyeliner doesn't stick
it continued to make my eyeliner
it might be better used as a nighttime eye moisturizer
i couldn't wait to get moisturizer on my face.
unfortunately the perricone moisturizer didn't help
i both used this eye cream
helps my concealer to go on very smooth.
i am in search of a good eye cream
00 for a product that only adds moisturizer to your skin
any lotion can do this.
it is a great moisturizer wish i could continue to use it
i did not find this eye cream moisturizing at all
i do let the cream soak in for awhile before i put the concealer on
this is a good moisturising eye creme.
there are times i use a moisturizer
my very dry skin feels as if i hadn't just applied a $75 moisturizer
this moisturizer is good
i wear sunscreen every single day
i would put it on under my sunscreen
no need for moisturizer
maybe a mask or intense moisturizer?
the only exfoliating i got was when i was trying to rub this stuff off
if using long wearing make up or sunblock you will definitely need another cleanser
when i finish my moisturizer
think i'll go back to retinol.
as i buy another moisturizer
the only problem i had with this moisturizer was that it was over moisturizing
putting a different moisturizer on top
lots of hype about this moisturizer
a bit more moisturizer than i need
is a little pricey when i can buy a great moisturizer from other br
there are better moisturizers for the price.
i usually use bliss' youth as you know it moisturizer
although cream is light
the firming cream is much better.
i switched by to my ole henriksen moisturizer
its like a regular moisturizer
this moisturizer quenched my skin overnight
use everything from their moisturizer to mascara
i like this night cream
this is a great moisturizer, don't get me wrong.
however i returned it since it didn't moisturize at all
for my super oily skin i still need to have a good moisturizer
fine moisturizer but ended up returning.
i don't like the fact the this cream has petrolatum in it
not a good ingredient to have in a cream
i feel extremely guilty for spending almost 50 bucks on a moisturizer
(not certain waterproof mascara).
thought it would do the same for the mascara
a chance against waterproof eyeliner or mascara
however it barely touches my waterproof mascara or even not waterproof eyeliner
such as waterproof mascara
although i would not recommend for waterproof mascara
especially for waterproof make up or when i wear multiple layers of mascara
i do not like it under my current concealer though
the radiance from the eye cream doesn't mix well with my concealer
feel like it is just a moisturizer that looks brightening
my face does feel a tad more moisturizers
yes i do use an origins moisturizer after i wash
even that moisturizer is pretty bad
i couldn't wait to get my moisturizer on
i find if i don't moisturize right away
it also doesn't do a great job at taking of mascara
when you put moisturizer on top it just peels right off
no amount of moisturizer would help.
it's hard juggling skin that gets dry without good quality moisturizer
got this to replace my origins ginzing moisturizer
this is just a heavier moisturizer that doesn't even moisturize that well
my acne got worse using this lotion probably because of the oils
this moisturizer was too heavy
used ginzing energy booster moisturizer before
it's back to ginzing energy booster moisturizer for me
was an ok moisturizer.
my skin was flaking after i used it even after i put moisturizer on
it's a nice moisturizer for the price
this felt like a good moisturizer
this product feels like regular moisturizer until applied
if i don't add a moisturizer in my day
i prefer my first-aid cream.
other moisturizer was making my face greasy
it felt like a layer of oil/tackiness sitting on top of your skin without moisturizing it at all
apply my usual morning moisturizer
where i applied this cream
use with a great moisturizer
even after using my normal daily moisturizer
this moisturizer does not sink into my skin
i initially chose this to wear under my concealer
this is a nice eye cream
this cream is fine
beyond than my regular face moisturizer for my eyes
while i don't have eye wrinkles i do like to moisturize with eye cream instead of facial lotion
this is a great eye moisturizer
this eye cream made my skin break out
i feel like i need to apply moisturizer immediately after washing my face
it doesn't add any moisturizer into my skin
the consistency of it is somewhat like a moisturizer
this product is more like a heavy moisturizer when put on the face
it's more like a medium to heavy lotion
i would tell myself to get a bottle of aloe gel rather than getting this product
i bet you can buy some better moisturizers
used it for a while as my nighttime moisturizer
this moisturizer makes my face really shiny.
i got a new moisturizer to helps moisturize my skin when i use this cleanser
the ingredients are recommended by my dermatologist which is why i want to pair it up with a really hydrating moisturizer
thick moisturizer for my dry spots
have to reapply or put the heavy duty moisturizer on those spots
felt heavier than other moisturizers which i can't st
while i realize this is a oil-free moisturizer
this moisturizer made it worse
on to the next moisturizer
i personally love lightweight creams.
so this lotion absolutely does it for me.
t's pretty much impossible to find a good moisturizer
sephora recently stopped selling the moisturizer i was using
i got even oilier than i was before i started using this moisturizer
i really wanted to love this moisturizer.
it seems that i bounce between moisturizers a lot
i wanted to like this moisturizer
typically use a moisturizer with clarifying properties
consistency of lotion very good
i didn't feel that it helped to moisturize my skin much
this moisturizer was awful for my skin.
it did not moisturize enough to justify the price tag
'll continue the search for a great moisturizer
this gel moisturizer was just okay.
normally i use a moisturizer for 3+ months
when i would apply this gel
because i really like the lotion
i love this moisturizer
this gel moisturizer didn't give me that feeling.
a better option is boscia's gel moisturizer.
i would use another moisturizer
i think this would be a great summer moisturizer.
the moisturizer is very black
if you rub your skin once the moisturizer dries
the only thing i found it did was moisturize
the packaging is similar to kate somerville moisturizers
still have to use concealer as
just about any eye cream/lotion will be light
i find that using a "serum" does more for my skin than eye creams
i think this lotion works okay.
my routine is undereye cream
now i have to add another layer of moisturizer to avoid my face looking
helps moisturizer sink into my skin better
this moisturizer is great for dry skin
for some reason gel moisturizers do not sink in for me
i just don't do well with gel moisturizers
this moisturizer is great for daytime.
decided to try out this moisturizer
tried it as an overnight moisturizer
i prefer the yellow moisturizer.
i need another moisturizer for the winter
this product has more of a gel consistency over a cream
i originally bought this after the clinique moisturizing gel wasn't doing enough for me in the winters
t dries out my skin despite being a moisturizer
it's pretty annoying to still have to buy my $50 clinique moisturizer in addition to this
i'll try poetry in lotion next after this is gone
great serums actually leave your face shiny
i finished the whole bottle i noticed that this product does not feel moisturize
i already have a strong regimen using retinol around my eyes
i still have to put on a mega moisturizer at night
wanted to add a serum to wear under my daytime moisturizer
even days when i only wore a tinted moisturizer or bb cream
the gel charcoal moisturizer from boscia is pretty good
i needed to layer on another moisturizer
i've bought alot of expensive creams
more of a cream that works on top of your skincare routine
it works pretty good as a moisturizer
too pricy for just a moisturizer
it is a really great moisturizer
it works great as a moisturizer
it is a great non-greasy moisturizer though.
i've only just started using this cream in my quest for a new moisturizer with an anti-aging kick
this is a good cream
other creams have done a better job.
expected a little more than just a moisturizer
most other cheaper moisturizers have a nice texture
my concealer would bunch up
it's just like applying moisturizer under the eye
it also goes on very smooth to prep for under eye concealer
love the lifting cream
moisturizers most of my face
was very excited to try this moisturizer
this moisturizer is light-weight
it also doesn't absorb like normal moisturizers.
i used this moisturizer for about a month before switching to a different moisturizer for better oil control
i found this moisturizer to be very lightweight
i prefer it over my yes to moisturizer
wanted to try a cream/gel situation for the summer
i liked this moisturizer at first
it is disappointing as a moisturizer.
kind of weird to experience from a moisturizer
i actually bought this moisturizer because it didn't make my face seem a flat matte
it took me a while to realize that the oiliness was due to this moisturizer
my mission is to find the perfect moisturizer for me
this moisturizer felt so good on my skin
i do not recommend this moisturizer for sensitive skin or combination dry skin
this moisturizer felt like a lotion
started to peel like crazy- no amount of exfoliating/moisturizer would fix it
this cream is nice
this cream works wonders
this is a good moisturizer
i really wanted to love this moisturizer
it gives me a little moisturizer
i like this moisturizer a lot
would only recommend using this on top of a moisturizer
very dry formula mascara
my bronzer came up on it too
if it can't even get bronzer off
how can it remove waterproof mascara??
i solve that issue with moisturizer
i expected it to be a serum or lotion
if prefer daytime because i use retinol every other night
it feels light, yet is a decent moisturizer.
nice cream, more like a balm.
which i would hardly say this moisturizer is
cream is as advertised
no better than any other moisturizer
i believe this is a good moisturizer
this is a decent moisturizer it i don't like the smell
a great moisturizer but i expected more.
because i wanted to try the moisturizer with a brightening effect
then when i realized it was my moisturizer
in my opinion this cream is not as good as the ole henriksen vitamin plus cream
just not the right moisturizer for me
my journey to find my holy grail moisturizer continues
this cream made my skin dry
this is a great moisturizer
but it did seem to be an effective moisturizer.
i will continue to use it as an under eye moisturizer though
the only downside to this moisturizer is the smell
i put on tons of moisturizer
i tried it as an alternative to biotherme's aqua source gel moisturizer
do well with a gel-based moisturizer
the concept of this moisturizer is nice
this moisturizer does temporarily brighten your skin
it is even nice dabbed over under eye concealer through the day
good moisturizer but is it a good wrinkle cream?
i find this to be a nice daily moisturizer
the search for the perfect moisturizer continues.
i find that omorovicza's rejuvenating night cream proved to be a worthy hydrator during the day for me
splurged on this eye cream
this cream is greasy
it didn't remove my sunscreen
i spend my skincare
the sunscreen does kind of help
greasy 24/7 after putting on this lotion
once i switched to this being my daily moisturizer
i much prefer the dramatically different lotion
having half a bottle of lotion that i can't use is unacceptable
ive used the clinique even better skin tone correcting moisturizer for years now with great success
it had the feel of old fashioned beach sunblock.
even when mixed with a moisturizer
in the cold months i think i need to stick with a rich moisturizer
i feel like i've been slathering on a gross smelling $100 placebo lotion
i only used a little before applying moisturizer.
even though i topped this off with a generous amount of moisturizer
put on moisturizer/spf
stung when i applied moisturizer with spf in it
moisturizer i could still smell it
i found this moisturizer inadvertently on sephora website
if you don't mind the price tag this reminds me of pond's combination skin moisturizer that was discontinued in 2002
it was a nice moisturizer just not worth the price
the combo of the heavy lotion
was going to follow this serum with the moisturizer included in the pack
i've applied this cream diligently
i prefer the algenist moisturizer
over-priced moisturizer that also didn't do much to help my breakouts
had already gotten the moisturizer
this moisturizer is so nothing.
this moisturizer did not help
i got this hoping it would be a good lightweight moisturizer that would keep breakouts in check
it would be an okay moisturizer for someone not sensitive to silicone
i noticed if i didn't use the clear days ahead moisturizer
there is something in this moisturizer my skin did not like
but a moisturizer it was not!
this moisturizer was okay
i do feel like it helped moisturize my skin
the moisturizer itself is very good it really helped with my dry skin
i felt the moisturizer in this product wasn't enough to balance out the salicylic acid
i found this to be very similar to the moisturizer
the lotion made me breakout even more.
this is a fine lotion
i feel like this moisturizer was just alright.
the regular moisturizer are the same both don't work
i would like this moisturizer a lot better if it had less fragrance
i found this product made my skin dryer which is weird because it's a moisturizer
this is probably the best facial moisturizer i've ever used
the moisturizer does an ok job.
then apply my moisturizer
must pair it with the glycolic moisturizer otherwise it is ineffective
this is a decent moisturizer.
this moisturizer is sorry!
i felt that this lotion was too thick
this is a very simple moisturizer
the moisturizer is excellent
it was an overall ok moisturizer in that it felt lightweight
i used this as a night moisturizer
this is great for oily/combo skin that needs a heavier moisturizer
the product does the job as a moisturizer
i certainly do not recommend this moisturizer
i used this under my makeup as an extra moisturizer
it will be going back because my drugstore mattifying lotion is just as good
i went with the murad mattifying moisturizer that has a sunscreen
if you utilize a c gel under your moisturizer or sunscreen
now i know that serums don't work overnight
it could honestly be labeled as a light-weight moisturizer
moisturizer which is great
this is a great product to use for moisturizing all over if you don't mind the heavy scent that is included
i don't think the price is worth it as a skin moisturizer
goes on like a really thin lotion with oatmeal
i really love the ultra repair moisturizer
i think there are a lot of mattifying lotions out there that is half the price
i like the mattifying quality of the lotion.
i feel like i need to put on more lotion
had to switch to another lotion for nighttime
this product was not moisturizing at all whatsoever for me
i guess i'll mix it with another moisturizer.
this way too light of a moisturizer to use in the winter
it's heavier than most creams i've tried
this is a great everyday moisturizer for night
just seemed like a regular moisturizer to me
it's a heavier moisturizer for sure
i felt like the moisturizer just sat on top of my skin
this was recommended to me as a night moisturizer
this always leaves a light film on my skin – i definitely couldn't use it as a day moisturizer
also helps concealer go on smoothly
needed two eye creams or to use my moisturizer
can use it as a moisturizer
made my concealer blend even better
use your money for a good concealer.
it did moisturize my underage area well
made applying concealer go on much more smoothly
not a bad light moisturizer
made my under eye concealer crease more than usual
this is a great eye cream
it looked more like a concealer than a cream.
it's reakky bad under concealers too.
instead just get a really good concealer.
found it to be an undereye concealer that did not blend well with my skin
it made my mascara
this product is not really an undereye cream at all
not enough to serve as a real concealer
had to put my other concealer on top of it if i wanted to cover my dark circles
the tint in the cream is not enough to act as a concealer either
it's more of a concealer than brightening dark circles
i tried to mix with my moisturizer
i don't think it gives my skin any more help than my moisturizer
only use it at night as a moisturizer
maybe i'm too used to serums that i can feel working
this stuff claims it has retinol in it
this retinol is not for me
isn't that what retinol is prescribed for at dermatologists?
i tried this cream as part of the luxe skincare promo
as someone who wears sunscreen everyday
there are better spf creams out there.
i am now using the rest as a décolletage moisturizer
i like using this as a nighttime face moisturizer
this moisturizer was recommended by vib rouge concierge
this moisturizer is not suitable for highly sensitive skin as the fragrance in it is so heavy
i can't believe i paid that much for a moisturizer
for the price of this dior moisturizer
good night cream is essential
required a moisturizer to follow immediately
this one is not so much a gel-like serum
moisturizer which are way too expensive for the results
thought my sunscreen had run in my eyes
f you don't want another scent on top of whatever the rest of your skincare regimen already has
don't expect it to be anything more than an undereye moisturizer
i'd be better off with moisturizer and concealer.
this brightener didn't dry very well
does make concealer easier to smooth on
if you don't mind/like silicone feeling moisturizers
the consistency was perfect for a daytime moisturizer
i found that this moisturizer is too oily for me
this is a nice basic moisturizer.
i used it daily under my tinted moisturizer for 2 weeks
no spf protection is a miss for me on this moisturizer
this moisturizer should get more stars because it's decent
i like this moisturizer because i have oily skin
this lightweight moisturizer gets the job done
at times i wanted something a bit more moisturizing
this is a rather small container if you moisturize morning
this face moisturizer did not help with moisturizing my face at all
have to use another lightweight moisturizer in addition to this
i loved the packaging of this moisturizer
had to discontinue using this moisturizer
the search for the right moisturizer continues...
this was a great day moisturizer for my combination
i feel i am on an eternal quest for the perfect moisturizer
i do not feel it helped moisturize my skin at all
this moisturizer didn't help at all.
this moisturizer was recommended to me in store for my sensitive skin
got this moisturizer recently
i suggest finding another moisturizer with no alcohol
it's a good basic moisturizer
this lotion was good.
i will continue the search for a good moisturizer
i wanted to love this moisturizer
i really wanted to like this moisturizer because i really love their cc cream
still like the cream
there's a lot to love about this moisturizer.
buy some other better moisturizer out there
i used this moisturizer to complete my routine
i started using the moisturizer as part of the kit with the camu camu serum
this moisturizer was a miss for me
this moisturizer seems really great at first.
this is definitely a good moisturizer
it is a good moisturizer
this moisturizer was too greasy for me.
i got this moisturizer to help with slight dryness
i can not go without this moisturizer
it really doesn't fit in well to my skincare routine at all
i don't think it's moisturizing enough for my under eye area
as it came with the new lancome gel moisturizer
i used it under my eye cream
it is a gel like formula that left my skin looking greasy
if you plan on using this product as a daily moisturizer after your a
i used this product as my primary moisturizer
it's an ok moisturizer.
it was just an average moisturizer
i only use at night because i prefer a lighter moisturizer during the day
is it a day cream?
this moisturizer is pretty heavy
for my under makeup moisturizer
so the moisturizing effects are working however for the high retail price i will likely stick to my regular moisturizer
this product is a great moisturizer
choose a more moisturizing cream that's cheaper like loccitane
i would recommend this cream as a moisturizer to protect skin
primer that brightens the complexion that u don't need much concealer or foundation after this
i do fell like it moisturizers
the only difference i've notice is that my under eye area feels moisturized when i use this in the morning before applying concealer
while it feels comforting just like most eye moisturizers do
it really is more cream than lotion
i each purchased this eye cream
i liked this moisturizer.
just not the moisturizer for me unfortunately.
it's definitely not as moisturizing as i would have liked
cream for my dry
even for a nighttime moisturizer
i ordered this moisturizer blindly
the benefit moisturizer is more suited for winter
the last time a lotion tingled on my face was a tanning lotion
lightweight moisturizer that just didn't do much for my skin
get rid of the original "make a difference" moisturizer
i used this as a nighttime moisturizer
this moisturizer seemed great on paper
it's definitely moisturizer so would be good for people with dry skin or as a night cream
i don't wear any foundation or concealer.
if you are careful while applying the concealer
love to rub it on after my moisturizer to give my skin an extra boost of hydration
i mix it with my moisturizer
i like that the cream is spf 15
like all eye creams
this eye cream does nothing.
this is nothing more than expensive moisturizer in a very small bottle
my concealer glides on a bit more easily
this looked like a cream but applied like a gel.
overall i like this cream
it was a good temporary moisturizer
this lotion left a film on my skin plus made my skin oily
every time i applied this moisturizer
i think overall it's a solid moisturizer.
this moisturizer is definitely a miss.
i think this is a good moisturizer
i think that's mostly bc my skin just doesn't need heavy cream moisturizers
i wanted this moisturizer to work out because the texture is so nice
this is an amazing cream for dry
i decided to invest in a quality moisturizer
not worth the price for a "just ok" moisturizer.
i found that this stuff only works well for me as a night time moisturizer
i loved this moisturizer at first
i would not choose this moisturizer
don't moisturize or help with brown spots
was using a moisturizer afterwards
this is an okay eye cream.
since i put concealer on my dark circles everyday i feel like i need a cream to firm
it also acts as a primer to keep my foundation/concealer in place
it's not a cream, more like a gel?
i like this cream.
it was hard to apply concealer after applying
i don't recommend using this product under your makeup as it made my foundation/eye concealer separate on my skin
maybe it was the retinol
i never really expect eye creams to work miracles
moisturizers that i would of liked to use on top
then put on my moisturizer
i decided to get a sample of day/night anti-wrinkle retinol cream
i would advise everyone to be careful with retinol
when i first used this cream
it is a decent moisturizer
for the amount of money for this moisturizer.
this moisturizer really is great for oily skin.
moisturizer all over after i apply
it's a very nice moisturizer
like it as a moisturizer though
it didn't even moisturizer properly
in the morning with sunscreen
this moisturizer absorbs quickly just like it says
i find this moisturizer to be more irritating to my skin versus "perfecting"
i've noticed every time i pair it with a bb cream or tinted moisturizer things start to ball up
i switched up the moisturizer
however as much as i like it as a moisturizer
idate for this type of moisturizer
this moisturizer is terrible
as i am applying my makeup it starts peeling off with the moisturizer
ordering the algenist moisturizer i had been using
i used this in combination with the matching moisturizer
if you use a retinol gel or cream like i do
i think the extra retinol from this eye serum is too much
with concealer on top of it
before i started using undereye concealer
it needs a moisturizing cream on top which is a little ridiculous with the price of the bottle
i know retinol is great for my skin
this serum just felt like putting gel under my eyes
this product made the full coverage concealer appear sheer
the only thing it really does is moisturize
when i used it in the morning it would roll off when i applied concealer
i'll admit that i apply eye cream liberally
it rolled with my moisturizer
i like my moisturizer
decent stuff not particular to any type of enhancement good moisturizer around eyes
i'd put your money to good quality concealer
i love this eye cream!!
had a similar experience with the amazonian clay mascara
t makes my concealer crease
it dose moisturize but i didn't see any brighten
cheaper eye creams that work just as well
use the daily moisturizer
it is a quite good moisturizer.
it feels more like a heavy moisturizer as opposed to a true mask
got this moisturizer as a gift.
the moisturizer is lucious
use it frequently in my moisturizer rotation
i tried using this cream
i started applying my dramatically different moisturizer over it
i need an under eye moisturizer before putting on under eye concealer so that it doesn't settle into my fine lines
i also like to moisturize my eyes overnight.
maybe this cream is just for older women.
works no better than any drugstore eye cream
so much so that my concealer felt like it was just floating on a layer of moisturizer all day
having tried the moisture surge moisturizer a couple of times
night moisturizers work great for me
with many other moisturizers i have put on overnight
it did do a good job of moisturizing my face
it felt more like a regular moisturizer.
i loved it at first it did a great job at moisturizing
i really wanted to love this moisturizer.
this cream is very thick and heavy duty.
more of a lotion than a cream
i went back to my other face moisturizer
this moisturizer made me breakout all over my face
a lightweight sunscreen on the thinner side.
i only bought this because it seems like they've discontinued my usual 15 spf daily hydration face lotion
i need a moisturizer with a tad more richness to it
there are some moisturizers that make my skin look
it feels like nothing more than a sunscreen
i found myself having to mix the night time moisturizer with the day time in order to have a little more moisturizer
everything i've tried up to this moisturizer has been great
i tried this as a recommendation for a lightweight moisturizer with spf protection
i don't think it's as moisturizing as some others i've tried
this moisturizer is alright
sadly this moisturizer was not one of them.
smells more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer
as i started applying the moisturizer on my face i had an overwhelming smell of e
i really wanted to love this moisturizer
using only this moisturizer i was seeking more moisture
i wanted to like this moisturizer
i wish it left my skin matte after application
this product is definitely a heavy moisturizer.
definitely a night time only moisturizer for me.
not my favorite moisturizer overall
it moisturized better than any moisturizer i've ever had
had to switch it to my night time moisturizer
the moisturizer seem to just stay on top of my skin
still craving for a good moisturizer
i originally wanted to use it as my main moisturizer
so my go to night moisturizer has been sesame seed oil
i mixed it with my day cream
mixed with my moisturizer
even my best moisturizer didn't help.
am still on the quest for a great moisturizer
i absolutely loved this moisturizer
it didn't moisturize my face all day
t is better as a night time moisturizer
the gel cream is fine
while this moisturizer goes on smooth
i liked this moisturizer a lot
i've never experienced this with a moisturizer before
feels more like a serum before a real moisturizer
when i think of you moisturizer
this moisturizer sits on top of my skin
i found that the moisturizer was very sticky on my face
first thing this is not a cream at all its a gel type moisturizer with no creamy feel at all
the umbrian oil free lotion is so much better
i really like the moisturizer
it did moisturizer my skin
it sat well with my concealer and makeup.
i used this eye cream
not sure my eyes need as much moisturizer as this provides
i usually love shiseido eye creams
the moisturizer feels a bit greasy in my opinion as well
this creme is good to give a bit of a refresh to your skin
i also alternate a moisturizer
otherwise it seems to be an ok moisturizer
this was sold to me as a daily moisturizer.
i wanted a self-tanning face moisturizer.
figured that it was just a regular moisturizer
i gave this product 1 star because it sort of moisturizes
i love this as a summer moisturizer
the smell of this moisturizer is phenomenal
i think i will stick with my gel moisturizer with hylaronic acid
the origins ginzing moisturizer is reported to be a gel moisturizer although it's a white cream when you look at it
for an energizing moisturizer meant to be used in the morning
i've had to switch back to my other moisturizer
this is definitely a nice lightweight moisturizer
this moisturizer is definitely nice and light.
great for a day time moisturizer!
moisturizer for my skin type
i like a more lightweight moisturizer for my eye cream
this moisturizer felt light
it's a lightweight moisturizer that will probably work better for oily skin
i wish it had sunscreen in it.
if i am going to add steps to my beauty regimen
the pore refining moisturizer
i really like this cream.
i applied the cream
feels like a greasy moisturizer
the cream is ok
i would not consider this a night time moisturizer
i could use this as a daytime moisturizer
this is a good moisturizer for some
it felt like any other moisturizer
i do notice a difference when i use a moisturizer at night
i would be better off getting a moisturizer instead
i guess a drugstore creme would do the same
this moisturizer made my face greasy
as a moisturizer its good
i like the texture of this moisturizer
only use moisturizers it left my face looking like a ghost
this was just an ok moisturizer for me.
the rep at the store could not recommend a moisturizer that was both mattifying
i wanted to like this moisturizer since it has helped the dryness of my combination skin's winter dry areas
this lotion leaves a tacky finish that makes applying mineral makeup difficult
even though i only gave this moisturizer 3 stars
one of the more expensive moisturizers i've tried from sephora
it is too expensive for the purpose of moisturizing when it just doesn't work
this moisturizer is spf 30
this moisturizer is okay but great or bad.
heavy to be used as a daytime moisturizer
which tends to happen with face creams with spf
not for a moisturizer as i use the finishing moisturizer which i love
i really wanted to like this moisturizer
this moisturizer lasts long and goes on smooth.
i needed a good moisturizer for my combo skin
its like any other moisturizer with spf in it.
this moisturizer did a great job of replenishing my skin
i find it a little hard to evenly spread my foundation after using this moisturizer
i will say a big plus is that it is pretty moisturizing
although i still used moisturizer
it did make my eyeshadow last all day
i don't feel it really helped moisturize my skin all that well
the repairative moisturizer from this line
along with this specific moisturizer
this facial moisturizer is nothing special.
felt like a mask even though it's just a moisturizer
it's not a thick moisturizer
moisturizer throughout the day
it's not pleasant for a face moisturizer
it's an average moisturizer at best
i wanted to like this moisturizer
it's a very run-of-the-mill moisturizer
i did not like this moisturizer at all.
my skin feels dry after i apply this lotion
this moisturizer is a good weight to wear at night in the colder months
this lotion just did not hold up
i usually have to put another moisturizer on top.
this moisturizer has just caused my skin to be nothing
i think my biggest issue with this is the exfoliating beads
/or sunscreen in the evening
this serum is a good weight to layer under moisturizer in the winter
flakes under makeup ruining concealer
this was an ok moisturizer
didn't do anything in terms of moisturizing my skin
i like the light lotion like texture
i like the smell of this moisturizer
this moisturizer made my skin very dry.
i wanted to love this moisturizer
i didn't love or hate this moisturizer.
i love the genius moisturizer
this serum was the only new item in my skincare regimen
serum moisturizer eye cream=$38
i'll throw this on in the mornings underneath lotion
doesn't do much else besides moisturize.
despite what the directions say i actually prefer it over the moisturizer because the silicones lock in the moisture
not enough spf for a daytime moisturizer so additional sunscreen is needed
i prefer gels over creams simply because they aren't as heavy
don't need sunscreen was mistake number one
i only wear it during the day because of the sunscreen
this is the first week of using this moisturizer.
this cream is too greasy.
i cannot wait to switch to a different moisturizer
i just hate everything about this moisturizer!!
i hate how there is spf in the moisturizer
i dont find this moisturizing at all -- it just sits on my face
next day had allergy to moisturizer with sunscreen
i will look for another eye cream.
since i also use a moisturizer
serum moisturizer eye cream=$38
it does make putting concealer on my undereye smoother
the only thing i can say is that my concealer goes on nicer with this cream
serum moisturizer eye cream=$38
i need a new moisturizer
this felt amazing when i mixed it with my moisturizer
i like thicker moisturizers at night
until now i'm searching for a really good retinol cream that's effective since i'm on my 30's
using too many serums or moisturizers on top can get sticky
ok for removing mascara.
i just wear a nickle sized amount of a lightweight tinted sunscreen
did do a formidable job removing my matte eyeshadow
good for after washing your face for extra hydration under lotion
does not remove my waterproof mascara
this is a great moisturizer
or if it's just the moisturizer
while it is a nice moisturizer it makes my face extremely greasy within hours
after using this moisturizer it leaves a shiny film over my skin that highlights any blemishes i may have
i need to switch moisturizers because the lotion is so thick that it leaves your skin shiny for hours after application
it does what it says it does - moisturizer.
i don't know, it's not my favorite moisturizer.
felt like i was putting on sunscreen
the lotion leaves my skin really oily
decided to buy this moisturizer
it didn't keep me moisturizer all day
this is a great basic moisturizer
an oldie basic moisturizer.
this lotion makes my face oily
it didn't moisturize my skin enough or at all
however whenever i would use this moisturizer i would get pimples on my forhead
i tend to adore all of clinique's moisturizers
the lotion gives a bit of a greasy feeling
this moisturizer is great
i started using this moisturizer because i ran out of my usual moisturizer
on top of which it wasnt even a great moisturizer
i would rather use any old drug store moisturizer
it made my concealer look ugly
this eye cream is not as good as other shiserdo eye creams
found this moisturizer very light to wear
i don't recommend buying this since it not moisturizing at all
like that this moisturizer is light and silky.
it is a great moisturizer for people with combination skin for the summer
i do feel like i get a shiny sheen to my face when using this moisturizer
not the worst moisturizer out there
one of the makeup artists "highly recommended" this moisturizer for oily skin
that it was a lightweight moisturizer
the night time moisturizer
good that it has spf for sun protection.
turns out it was this moisturizer
this moisturizer was way too watery
i am currently using the first aid beauty ultra repair cream as a day moisturizer
figured i could probably benefit from some sun protection in my moisturizer
i find this moisturizer ok.
i just wanted a facial moisturizer
i wanted something more natural that was a good quality moisturizer with sunscreen without worrying that the artificial scent stuff was going to clog pores
wasnt a big fan of the moisturizer
when i used the moisturizer it leaves behind a light oily film on my face
it feels like a sunscreen lotion when you have it on
when i put any foundation or concealer on my dry patches
i feel like it did an average job of moisturizing
this moisturizer probably contri
i used it consistently as a moisturizer
this is also not a cream
this moisturizer has some great qualities
this lotion made great claims
when i apply this moisturizer at night
the consistency of this moisturizer is nice.
like every other moisturizer i've tried
i think its a great moisturizer for normal skin
i also really dislike the greasiness of this moisturizer
i think i'll stick with my regular face moisturizer
believing that this light-weighted moisturizer would be perfect for my combination/oily skin
the this moisturizer is the only thing i've tried on recently
i got this moisturizer to use during the summer because i needed something lightweight
just like their refining moisturizer
the smell of this moisturizer is so strong you think this is a perfume
i felt like this particular moisturizer from this br
the fragrance in this lotion is too strong for my h
this moisturizer was no good for me
i am so disappointed in this moisturizer.
was hoping to find the same attachment to this moisturizer
i really liked the skincare line
didn't find it did a goid job at taking off waterproof mascara
this balm is ok
need to use a heavy duty moisturizer after removing this mask
if this was a $40 moisturizer i would totally buy
so first impressions: it smells a bit like old sunscreen
because of this i have to use under eye concealer every day
too expensive for a cream.
i struggle to find appropriate daytime eye creams
it can pill up a bit
my eyeshadow was very hard to blend
under/over any eye cream/face cream/sunscreen
it is a nice moisturizer
i'll admit i didn't use any sunscreen when using this product
this does not work at all without sunscreen
it's not exfoliating my skin: it's the product that i can rub off on my h
i really loved this as a moisturizer in general
i used this under three different moisturizers
this cream made my skin burn
this night cream s not as moisturizing as the sheer day cream
day cream with spf is fantastic
this night cream is amazing
this is a heavier cream
the first time i used it i actually had to moisturize after
am currently on "belif true cream moisturizing bomb
i feel like a good moisturizer does a better job than this mask
the directions also say that you can use this as a light layer over moisturizer
because i love a moisturizer from the same br
i am a strong believe in using an oil treatment as a moisturizer
this moisturizer kept the dry skin away for sure
i love this cream.
face with lots of moisturizer
i used this cream together with the ceramidin lotion
i am just going to use it as a lotion for my body
moisturizer other than the consistency of this product is a little thick
got this as a light moisturizer
it is just a very gentle light moisturizer before applying heavier cream
i'll definitely continue to use the cream
invest in a different moisturizer
if you are hoping to purchase a moisturizer that will offer you visible improvements in your skin
if your gonna spend $90 on a moisturizer
i will continue using their regular daily moisturizer though
even with my origins moisturizer
i need extra cream to smooth it.
i really wanted to love this moisturizer.
so had high hopes for this moisturizer
this moisturizer did not work for my skin at all
this moisturizer is very good for those who have dry to very dry skin
the lotion was great this summer
when i removed this moisturizer from my routine
i definitely found it to be more moisturizing than fresh youth preserve
other moisturizers i have tried
i think the is a ok moisturizer
the moisturizer in this package
especially considering that the other ibuki moisturizer was fine for my skin
wanted a "light-weight" moisturizer
would be fine as a night moisturizer
this moisturizer does go on heavy
i will continue to use it as a moisturizer
this cream is light
the lotion was ok.
i really wanted to like this moisturizer.
going back to my old moisturizer
which is great when using under concealer
unlike the coordinating face moisturizer
doesn't take off even non-waterproof mascara
even waterproof aqua eyeshadow
but my mascara is waterproof.
i don't wear waterproof mascara
it didn't get any of my gel eyeliner nor any of my waterproof makeup
didn't take off all my mascara
this product is ineffective at removing waterproof gel-eyeliner
cheaper moisturizers since purchasing this
it is a night time moisturizer
works well as a moisturizer
cream just to use it up
applies thin like a moisturizer not like a face mask
works exactly like a heavy moisturizer.
not a mask either a oily moisturizer.
just a thicker tackier moisturizer.
it just works like a normal moisturizer
not even a good moisturizer
it's not that much better than other overnight moisturizers
this stuff is the same as a bunch of 'glow' type tinted moisturizers
serum moisturizer eye cream=$38
it's a nice moisturizer if nothing else
just a regular effective eye cream
the beauty advisor highly recommended this cream over another cream
this is admittedly not a wrinkle cream
when i apply concealer
there are certainly other hydrating eye creams for a lot less money
concealer my under eye area looked cakey
creams can be too heavy
it is a good moisturizer, but that's about it.
i really wanted to love this product since i wanted to incorporate retinol in my skin care regimen
it's like a gel-lotion formula
retinol anti-aging moisturizer might do the trick
it is a good moisturizer
i soon realized that this moisturizer is simply not moisturizing enough for me
not what i look for in a moisturizer.
after this moisturizer had been on my face
even the ceo moisturizer is way better than this
i would never think of putting this algenist moisturizer under makeup
after about 2 month daily use i found that it is not moisturizing at all
i tried different kind of algenist moisturizer
this moisturizer is thicker
i'll be going back to the nude advanced renewal moisturizer
nothing a good quality moisturizer doesn't fix
it's basically an expensive moisturizer
it feels like moisturizer
this works fine as a nighttime moisturizer
i am 29 with pretty good skin thanks to rigorous skincare
this is an expensive bottle of mediocre moisturizer
this is a nice lotion
it is not too expensive for a brightening serum
this eye cream is ok.
it's a great moisturizer for the eye area.
go back to the rose gel cream
i'd keep buying this moisturizer for the smell
i gave this product a "fair" rating since it was a nice under-eye moisturizer
i didn't have much wrinkle before i used this cream
this cream didn't do anything for me besides moisturizing
it's a light weight lotion
this is a very intense moisturizer.
my skin feels like i put sunblock on
feels like sunblock that won't absorb.
i can't stand when moisturizers don't soak in.
using my regular moisturizer
this moisturizer was way too thin
it goes moisturize really well if you use it day
if you don't mind the smell or price it is a nice moisturizer
while it's a decent moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer however
this moisturizer goes on very smooth
i saw nothing different with my skin as i did with other moisturizers
you can find just as good of a moisturizer with a cheaper cost
cream is definitely rich
in my opinion clarins anti- age sunscreen works much better
i tried to put this sunscreen under my eyes
the acne solutions clarifying lotion picked up way more on the cotton ball
second it doesn't even take off all my non waterproof mascara
does not take off mascara and i'm blind.
it doesn't do much in taking off waterproof mascara
balms that definitely do a better job than this
it doesn't do a very good job with waterproof mascara
cons: does not break down mascara
ive tried wearing my fave nars creamy concealer with
i typically use an eyeshadow primer in that area with much success
my concealer creased using this product the way it does when i don't prime that area at all
when i apply concealer under my eyes i have 1 fine line that all of the concealer settles into
keep concealer from creasing
felt no difference using this- it still made my concealer crease
it's too much like moisturizer than a primer.
if you're just looking a moisturizer is good
i love this moisturizer!
not a good as the cream
the lotion goes on smotthly
the moisturizer is really
this moisturizer was way too light to do any great service to my skin
i like this lotion but it doesn't have a spf.
the lotion pilled when applying my makeup
i be fair i tried with three different sunscreens
i really like the black tea moisturizer
lightweight moisturizer that didn't irritate my skin
i will stick with the lotus moisturizer from fresh
thought this lotion would have a more cream-like texture
this moisturizer is simply average
it was like putting a drugstore moisturizer on except that is is pricey
this is an ok moisturizer
lightweight moisturizer for daytime use
i never have been able to use eye creams or serums
high spf daily moisturizer for my oily/very acne prone skin
i wanted to love this moisturizer because it seemed to check every box
the spf 30 is amazing
my skin was not brightener
it worked really well as an under eye moisturizer
it's basically a glorified concealer
going back to my previous sunscreen
this moisturizer feels heavy
i dislike this moisturizer quite a bit
i switched from the origins spf 25 perfect world moisturizer
way better serums out there....
tinted moisturizer for eyes
this goes well with mascara
the sephora person put this under my eyes before concealer
works well when applied for extra coverage on your concealer
i find that i still have to use a concealer on top
the triple remedy helps to moisturize my under eyes so that the concealer goes on a lot more smoothly
concealer in one is ingenious
don't want/need a heavy concealer on a day to day basis
with my extremely dry skin i felt like my concealer caked on top of this like no other
with a good moisturizer first
i can just use a concealer for that then!
dry skin still feels dry after apply sunscreen
would create a barrier to boost my moisturizer
i definitely need to apply a moisturizer over this
this cream is a fantastic day moisturizer except it has no element of sun protection
it was fine i guess for a lightweight moisturizer
there are much better creams available
making any mascara or eyeliner difficult to remove
some normal moisturizer can't do
every time i use this gel
i blamed it to a bad reaction to a bronzer.
a moisturizer is definitely needed.
i hope that they make a cream or lotion type version soon
am using the bronzer
it goes on smoothly on my skin that i prep with a moisturizer
i found another tinted moisturizer that is far superior
it's great with all added in skincare benefits
just in case my moisturizer made it change color
it is the furthest thing from hydrating
didn't realize this lotion contained caffeine
this moisturizer feels good initially
the lotion had too much of a fragrance
they recommend this oil along with the moisturizer
i returned this along with the moisturizer.
i read a skincare expert's review of this eye cream
this is a fine eye creme
this eye cream is okay.
was encouraged to buy this eye cream by a sephora employee simple because at age 24 eye cream was not a part of my skincare routine
i find a lot of eye creams/gels/gel creams i have used are kind of greasy
on a daily basis the only thing i put on my skin is moisturizer
i applied the eye cream
i love verso's day cream
i'll give it 2 stars because the moisturizing strip did feel nice
if you are sensitive to sunscreen
i tried the day cream
i can't use the day cream with the sunscreen ingredients
though any great facial moisturizer would do the same
bought this in a set with the eye creme
spend it on a better eye gel
this product felt like hairspray on my under eye.
it is hard to apply my under-eye concealer after.
i am new to eye cream
i noticed that my concealer goes on a little better the next morning
so later my concealer would react with it
purchased hoping that this moisturizer would help to brighten my skin
it's a great light moisturizer for oily skin
for the price i expect much more in a moisturizer
ok for a very expensive/heavily perfumed moisturizer appropriate for dry/normal skin
-to be used in conjunction with moisturizer
it feels like more of a gel-cream lotion
it is a great moisturizer
no more than any other decent moisturizing product
especially when you are then supposed to use another moisturizer/spf on top of it
it also flakes a bit when putting concealer on top of it
will stick with dramatically different moisturizer
it does take off mascara great with a cotton ball
i don't find relief until i put on moisturizer
then i get a bunch of mascara
eyeliner in my eyes
i wear eye cream religiously for preventative reasons
bought the day cream as well as the eye cream
was tremendously surprised that this cream did not moisturize my skin enough
so maybe it's a great option as an exfoliator for sensitive skin?
i will stick to my murad aha exfoliator
i wanted to love this moisturizer.
this is marketed as a booster to your moisturizer
i would prefer to spend money on a really good treatment or moisturizer over this product
i've used their moisturizers for years.
if you buy quality serums
you can put your moisturizer on just a minute later
it seems like shiseido skincare line is not for me
love my shiseido tinted moisturizer
then layer it with one or two serums for day
it was just like a regular moisturizer
i do think it's an okay moisturizer
i don't think this lotion is good for sensitive skin
this is one of those cream sleeping type masks
i only use non-waterproof mascara
it does not remove my sunscreen
i still find that i have left over mascara
it did not create a good canvas for my concealer
i noticed my concealer was cakey
i tried this cream
for the price of the eye cream
this is nothing short of a moisturizer at best
just starting to try eye creams
it is a pretty good moisturizer
when paired with another moisturizer
i noticed this doesn't get all my mascara off
it's not waterproof mascara
did not take off waterproof eyeliner or even a regular mascara
once you rub to get your lipstick/stain
does nothing to break down mascara
i don't even wear waterproof mascara
it had a hard time with my waterproof eyeliner
you are risking getting dark spots because it is a retinol cream
must use eye concealer
perfect as a prep step for concealer
maybe w/ a moisturizer it would have been better.
it is so dry that i can't apply any concealer
it's more like a matte cream.
i prefer the ginzing eyecream as a daytime eye cream
this could a great moisturizer for a girl with normal skin
don't need a heavy moisturizer
worse than using a moisturizer.
i don't have to use as much concealer.
my daily moisturizer couldn't even get rid of it
use every morning before moisturizer
all your left with is a very expensive moisturizer
i used face lotion after
i still had to use a moisturizer afterwards
once before bed just like i would any other moisturizer
it's a pretty good moisturizer for dry skin
for the high price i expected more than just moisturizing
i've used the face cream
i am certainly expecting something more moisturizing as overnight mask
use moisturizer with sunscreen daily from an early age to minimize how many wrinkles you get when you are older
lightly moisturizer face in the morning
have used sunscreen daily for 31 years
then applying this lotion-type product
i love the moisturizer
i coupled with the moisturizer
it's okay once i apply a moisturizer
this moisturizer felt very heavy
it is a great moisturizer
find myself reapplying this moisturizer
i feel like it was on-par with a typical drugstore moisturizer
this is a great moisturizer
it also didn't agree with the sunscreen i use
stuck with my usual moisturizer
renewed hope in a jar is too thick of a moisturizer for me
if you're thinking about this moisturizer
after putting on some sunscreen a few minutes after this moisturizer
i started getting little flakes of the moisturizer
i love the smell of this moisturizer
this moisturizer is ok
was excited to cash in some of my points for this moisturizing
this moisturizer made my skin feel soft at first
there are better moisturizers out there
first aid beauty face moisturizer is so much better in my opinion
it is essentially a moisturizer
concealer doesn't go on smoothly
this is an ok eye cream
the cream worked well on my skin
i put it on as an overnight moisturizer
f you discover that this oil is too emollient for your skin
applying my usual moisturizer was not enough
i think the exfoliating beads may be a little much
wish that they would make a more moisturizing bar
it made my moisturizer less effective
i didn't like this eye cream.
leaves a feeling of applied moisturizer
i suppose this might work for people who wear just skincare or tinted moisturizer
i don't wear waterproof liner or mascara
not even waterproof mascara
that's true of most eye creams
mostly because it's a moisturizer
it does provide a smooth surface for concealer
my concealer worked way better with this product on
i still have to use a lot of concealer
made my concealer crease more than usual as well
this product was put on me during a concealer consult
its always a hassle because concealer
i noticed more creasing of my concealer with this
for me it does not work when using concealer
throughout the day my concealer would flake off
i've used the same concealer for about 2 years
the tarte eye cream is so much better.
like most eye creams
it gives me a great base under my moisturizer
i got this moisturizer as a gift
this eye concentrate works well as a moisturizer.
any time i would layer this under any other cream or moisturizer
i am really lazy when it comes to skincare
it was also causing my moisturizer
it just felt like i was putting a gel moisturizer on
if i want a nice moisturizer i'll use a heavy cream or an oil
this lotion is really amazing
i already have great moisturizers
you definitely need to use a good moisturizer after using this product
with the liberal use of my regular moisturizer
causes me problems when i try to apply my concealer for the day
just recently i've noticed that after i apply my concealer
cannot apply undereye concealer when using this produce because it flakes off
cannot be used with concealer
you can get plain vanilla moisturizer for a lot less
the creams go's on really nice & cool.
save your money for a good concealer.
i decided to go with this one since it is marketed as exfoliating
you can damage your skin if you over exfoliate.
try to invest in a good moisturizer
even after applying moisturizer
once i use a moisturizer
get a new eye cream
it doesn't blend well with concealer or foundation
i feel as if it was more of a moisturizer rather than a youth preserve eye cream
i guarantee you can find an eye cream that just moisturizes for way cheaper than $43
nice daytime eye cream
made putting concealer on a nightmare.
very nice as a basic eye moisturizer
then i use a thin regular moisturizer all over my face the next day with sunscreen as undereye moisturizer melts my off
it is an amazing moisturizer
i prefer my serums to have a little bit more substance to them
because the oil does not cleanse mascara or eyeshadow off well enough
really bad experience with this moisturizer!
recommended it as a great daily moisturizer
it looked like i was rubbing bronzer on my face
i want to love this product because it's a moisturizer
the face finishing moisturizer tint looks grey'ish
0% humidity -- was so excited to find an spf + bronzer in one
i really wanted to like this moisturizer.
instead what i got was a moisturizer that made my face greasy with breakouts
i really need to start using sunblock
it is pretty-much the same as their face-finishing moisturizer
be aware that it is a bronzer or self tanner
i think the product works well under moisturizer
compared to other serums i have used this really didn't feel any different that a regular moisturizer
even after i use moisturizer
so that every time i followed it with moisturizer or bb cream
i follow this with astara brightening moisturizer
even after applying moisturizer on top of it
jawline so a rep at the store suggested this gel for it
just like another layer of moisturizer
as the consistency is most like a thicker gel-based lotion
the regular lucent moisturizer is much better!
this seems more like a tinted sunscreen.
turns out it's just like a tinted moisturizer
i love shiseido skincare but this?
i honestly really like this exfoliator.
layering sunscreen etc on top means your skin feels like it has a film on it
i decided on this eye cream
feels like just a basic moisturizer
i let the lotion soak in for quite a while beforeh
it goes on like a cream
basically it's really expensive lotion in a small bottle
just did an all around perfect job moisturizing my skin for the day
the only moisturizer i found to work
this new formula is simply not as moisturizing as the old one
it's the only lotion that works for me
was excited to try this moisturizer
it was my moisturizer for many years
i'll have to find a different moisturizer.
pill under my tinted moisturizer
it's heavier than the original light moisturizer
for the price i paid i hope it did more for my skin other than just moisturizing
this is a solid daily moisturizer.
whenever i wear this moisturizer during the day my skin ends up looking
i am in search of a moisturizer with spf
then i looked at the sunscreen ingredients
personally for me i try to stay away from such sunscreens
hope philosophy changes up their sunscreen ingredients
it's a balm not a cream or a gel
i needed a new eye cream
while it is very moisturizing i haven't seen a difference in my fine lines
my first try on eye creme was this product.
messed up my concealer
i much prefer my shiseido eye cream.
this is a perfectly fine moisturizer
need to change up my skin regimen
it did moisturize i guess.
in conjunction with the good genes moisturizer as recommended
wrinkles that i was hoping this cream would help
just use this as my moisturizer
i know i"m supposed to wear sunscreen
it works super great as my sunscreen for my h
what was my moisturizer of choice
murad's skincare lines are awesome
i need to apply over moisturizer
when i apply any concealer or foundation on top
a better way to get a good amount of spf on your skin is with a moisturizer
i won't be returning the sunscreen
when you put lotion or sunscreen on top
this sunscreen is great in theory
its an ok moisturizer but its not mattifying.
it just feels like a regular lotion just more jelly
u can not use this as a moisturizer even if you have oily skin
would be a excellent luxury in between moisturizer
this moisturizer still leaves a heavy layer on my skin
noticed bits of the moisturizer coming off
the moisturizer is literally coming off my skin.
could use regular face lotion
it's a really nice feeling moisturizer
rescue me from this moisturizer!
this moisturizer gave me huge under the skin pimples
it also didn't live up to the title of a 'mattifying' moisturizer
ok moisturizer, but nothing special.
was thinking that i do need to moisturize my skin more-
all it really did for me was moisturize.
i love the feel of this moisturizer
was using it every couple days instead of my normal moisturizer
i adore this moisturizer.
this moisturizer did very little for my dry patches
this is a very heavy cream
wanted to try a new moisturizer
t is very important for me that my moisturizer is not only effective
i did not like this moisturizer
the cream is to heavy
the sunscreen left my face with white spots
this is a good light weight moisturizer for morning time use
this moisturizer isn't so great.
this didn't moisturize enough to make it worth it
this moisturizer did not agree with my skin personally
i like how lightweight this moisturizer is
i've tried many moisturizers because my skin is so dry
was hoping this would be a lot more moisturizing
it would be a good lightweight moisturizer for summer
this moisturizer was decent
this moisturizer makes me super oily
this moisturizer makes you look extremely glowy
i would use this as a night moisturizer
this moisturizer would be getting at least 4 stars if it weren't for the overwhelming use of fragrance
this is not a night cream nor a day moisturizer.
i prefer the moisturizing bomb by belif to this.
i am changing to a different moisturizer now.
i love the belif cream
i tried the aqua bomb moisturizer
unfortunately other than a great moisturizer
thought i should try this plantscription eye cream to go along with my skincare routine
it moisturizes like any other cream out there
then i used undereye concealer with it the next day
it wasn't the concealer bc i've used it with other eye creams before
it is an ok eye cream
was not even an effective moisturizer :
i feel like eye creams are just gimicks
i wish this was just a basic everyday moisturizer that helped turnaround skin cells
other than that it's nice for a day moisturizer for my dry skin
moisturizer because my face just wasn't happy with it
this is basically a shimmery moisturizer
i wanted to ignore the glitter part because the moisturizing part of it is amazing
i will definitely stick to the clinique dramatically different moisturizers
for the most part this is a decent moisturizer.
what kind of daytime moisturizer has no spf???
i really like this lotion
this moisturizer is light weight
i tried it by itself and under moisturizer.
nothing a good moisturizer couldn't fix
this is a great as a sunscreen
this cream made my face really matte
i did not find it to be a good moisturizer
have used the genius moisturizer
i just couldn't spend that much on a moisturizer
the cream was great
this product really acts more like a sunscreen then a moisturizer that happens to have spf
is almost mattifying when applied
i like that this moisturizer has spf 30.
my dermatologists say to use spf 30 every day.
the best sunscreens are in a tube or bottle.
i love this moisturizer
this was the first time i put a moisturizer on
more like applying sunscreen
it feels a bit like you're just wearing sunscreen
presumably due to the sunscreen
it's weird because i actually like the normal fab ultra repair moisturizer a lot for my evening moisturizer
the sunscreen in this is great
this moisturizer is super thick, omg.
in a weird way i feel like this sunscreen moisturizer has been improving my skin
it does have the "sunscreen smell"
used this sunscreen over it
it felt like old school thick 80s sunscreen.
i love all of the first aide beauty moisturizers
i don't see how this would work as a daily sunscreen
i really wanted to like this sunscreen
it's more a heavy duty sunscreen than a moisturiser for sure
i absolutely adore my firstaid ultra repair lotion
this acts like a sunscreen, not a moisturizer.
i wanted a moisturizer with a sunscreen in it
not a sunscreen with a moisturizer in it
this is a very nice moisturizer
this feels like sunscreen
it seems just like typical sunscreen
a mineral sunscreen moisturizer with an spf that wasn't too high or too low
this sunscreen is very good to leave you skin ready for makeup
i wanted to give this sunscreen a shot because i love fab
i can only wear mineral sunscreens so when i saw fab had released a moisturizer/mineral sunscreen combo i was sold
this works fine as a sunscreen
really doesn't do much for me as a moisturizer
i will say that most sunscreens make my eyes water a bit if i sweat
this sunscreen makes it look chalky
i am pretty obsessed with sunscreen
this cream is very heavy
a fine sunscreen that is easy to blend.
but it is not a moisturizer.
just feels like a regular sunscreen
i appreciate that it's a zinc sunscreen because a lot of people
need more physical sunscreen options
this is a straight up white zinc heavy sunscreen that can only be used on the beach
this is a decent moisturizer.
it didn't even take off all of my non-waterproof mascara
i liked it paired with the matching lotion
it was almost as if i hadn't put moisturizer on at all after my acne product
i kept my normal skincare routine
didn't think it hydrated any more than my typical clinique moisturizer
i wanted a solid balm for travel
i don't know what kind of waterproof mascara other people are using
i love the erborian double lotion
like i have lotion on my face
it's an eye cream
this is the worst lotion i've ever purchased.
i didn't like how the lotion came out of the bottle
switched my moisturizer to this
it takes so much of this stuff to actually moisturize
a sephora employee told this is an exfoliator.
i tried this moisturizer on my t-zone skin.
the cream is good.
i think it's a basic light, gel cream.
i find that was more the essence then the moisturizer
i made the mistake of using this as an all day moisturizer
even after putting my moisturizer on
70's who knew about sunscreen?
i love that this product is a moisturizer
as far as sunscreen + moisturizers go
it's actually got little beads for exfoliating in it
the consistency is of a gel-moisturizer
they work perfect without the creme
if i use it underneath concealer
it makes the concealer flake
i'd recommend clinique eye repair cream with spf 20
the skin perfecting lotion works much better for me
this moisturizer is okay
it felt just like sunscreen to me.
leaves that sunscreen feel and smell.
my search for a good moisturizer with spf continues
don't like the strong sunscreen smell that it has
i've always been funny about moisturizers cause i have oily skin
never with a moisturizer that contained sunscreen
switched back to the sephora 8 hr mattifying moisturizer sunscreen
i only put moisturizer on my cheeks
decided to give this matifying lotion a try
this texture of this "eye concentrate" reminds me of a light weight lotion
it is a rich eye cream
it didn't interfere with my concealer at all
i shouldn't have expected much since it is an inexpensive moisturizer
the + version just doesn't moisturize my skin in the same way
my sephora didn't have any other travel size moisturizers from clinique
this moisturizing cream in hopes that my horrible break outs would clear up
moisturizer residues stay on your face
bought this lotion for my dry skin
i am a diehard fan of clinique's dramatically different moisturizing lotion
pill up--not a good look
do not curl up like other gel moisturizers
it's a good daily moisturizer
i picked up this moisturizer because a ptr rep at sephora told me it would be great for combo skin
i wanted to love this moisturizer
my night moisturizer is much better
was excited when i found their anti-aging moisturizer with spf
i've used the miracle worker moisturizer for a few years
i'd hoped this would be a great sunscreen
the sunscreen ingredients are unstable
i prefer a thicker moisturizer that i know will really soak into my skin
this has the most unique texture to any moisturizer i've ever tried
wish that it was a regular moisturizer
it's a lightweight moisturizer that won't make your face feel greasy during the day
this ended being just a simple moisturizer for me
a bit too expensive for an average moisturizer.
this moisturizer was highly recommended by a sephora associate
any drugstore moisturizer probably would have worked the same or better
if you are going to spend $48 on a moisturizer
i wanted to love this gel cream.
did not love this or the overnight moisturizer
i went into sephora wanting a better moisturizer than my old clinique one
this moisturizer did not agree with my skin
this moisturizer is also good for brightening
i would see my eyeliner or mascara-not sure which one-raccooning under my eyes
this is a good balm
this moisturizer is good, but not life changing.
works as an ok moisturizer,
i enjoy this moisturizer for my everyday needs
it didn't moisturize as much as i expected
that's exactly what happened with this moisturizer
the sheer transformation moisturizer is a better option than this moisturizer
tight like i need to add another night moisturizer over it
concealers that i have used forever
i felt like this didn't really moisturize all that well
i do not recommend this creme
not the best eye cream
such as foundation or concealer
i never have a problem with my mascara
i also noticed that my concealer was flaking
i could see the concealer
even my eye cream
-' it didn't moisturize the skin under my eyes really well
this is a nice eye cream
the cream is soft
decided to try the eye balm
not the best eye cream
i wanted to love this moisturizer since i use the immortelle night cream
i decided to try their cheaper moisturizer- precious cream
it didn't do any better than my drugstore moisturizer buys
this cream is ok.
this is s great moisturizer
sigh~~ where can i find my perfect moisturizer.
i think i will try new first aid rich moisturizer
to the point it was flaking even with moisturizer
i am very disappointed in tatcha serums.
it is much thicker and tackier than most serums.
i just ordered the combo package with the new power moisturizer
slightly moisturizing if you can get it out of the bottle
have to mix this product with face crème in order to actually moisturize my face
this moisturizer leaves a sticky film on my face that is terrible for applying makeup or trying to sleep
it would pill up
just a typical face lotion or primer.
overall the moisturizer works pretty good
you need a ton of it to truly moisturizer your face
there is no sunscreen in this blend
i needed a new eye cream
the cream/serum did not deliver what it promised
first off this moisturizer has an extremely strong smell
i don't really care much about the dark circles because i have a nice concealer
i don't think it worked better than lower priced moisturizers i've used
the moisturizer was great
this moisturizer was average.
my skin can only tolerate this moisturizer only at night
i expected this cream to perform better than creams half the price
today after wearing it layered with my other serums
had been excited to try the gel cream
this moisturizer is super light weight
t was definitely the gel cream
since i don't like to wear moisturizer under my makeup
this moisturizer was terrible.
used it when i ran out of my regular moisturizer
decided to use it one morning as the moisturizer underneath my foundation
will never purchase this moisturizer again
my skin was never able to absorb this moisturizer
this is my least favorite day moisturizer that i have tried
this is a horrible moisturizer
if i need a moisturizer on the fly
never seen anything quite like it from a moisturizer
i really wanted to like this product because i need a new moisturizer
was personally in the market for a new moisturizer
i really like the way this cream moisturizers
find an all natural day time moisturizer
i do not recommend this moisturizer
this seemed like a good moisturizer--natural
i guess it would be a good moisturizer if it's compatible with your primer
i used it up as a nighttime moisturizer to avoid the daytime issue
was surprised when this "light" moisturizer didn't absorb into my skin
have yet to find a day moisturizer that works for me
assumed i would love this moisturizer
i might be able to use it as a night moisturizer
under my lipstick or balm
when i used it as a morning moisturizer it didn't absorb
what better time to whip out my sample bag of hydrating skin lotions
just as i was running out of my perricone point perk moisturizer
even then it peeled off my skin when i applied my concealer over it
this moisturizer is not good at all.
while using this moisturizer
look for another day moisturizer
i did not like this moisturizer.
i much prefer other moisturizers to this one
i wanted to love this lotion
this moisturizer didn't do anything to my skin.
product was okay to use for daily moisturizer
however it does work as a daily radiance booster under moisturizer
moisturizer are doing more than this in evening out my skin
makes my concealer dry up under my eyes
you know those moisturizers or oils or lotions that will sit on the surface of your skin
it surprised my skin with the skincare routine change
i do recommend the aloe after sun spray from them though
i love this eye cream.
works nicely layered under a moisturizer.
this lotion was just okay for me.
it was sticky and made my concealer separate.
my concealer was patchy when mixed with it
noticed that it was making the concealer under my eyes look awful
if it didn't make the concealer crease
if you want something that moisturizes
i usually use my rosehip oil with this eye cream for night time skincare
this is really more for undereye bags
my makeup seems to pill when i use this in the mornings
really have to make an effort rubbing in my moisturizer or sun screen
figured i would switch up my day time moisturizer with this serum
sunscreen an boy was i glowing naturally
day moisturizer from drunk elephant
you have to either use a moisturizer or makeup over it to reduce the stickiness
even with my sunscreen on top
followed with my daily moisturizer
used this for about a week as a daytime moisturizer
it reminds me more of a primer than a moisturizer
it's a nice average skin cream
isn't it supposed to be a moisturizer?
texture if you want to massage your face
does not have sun protection for a day cream
i wanted to try a new moisturizer
tried lathering more cream on thinking it would do the trick
it feels like mens shaving cream!
like you're applying shaving cream to your face
it is like rubbing shaving cream all over your face
it comes out just like shaving cream
i wear a lot of waterproof mascara
it feels like shaving cream
works great as a shaving cream on legs
i followed with my moisturizer
i got the regular size along with the nighttime moisturizer
it is almost like a gel.
concealer didn't slide off it or get cakey
it is an okay eye cream
it also made my under eye concealer
my eyeshadow crease so bad
this is a great eye cream.
it moisturizers, so i have it 3 stars.
make sure to apply over a light moisturizer
i wore 80 spf sunscreen.
used sunscreen as recommended.
have used sunblock since my late teens
i made sure that i used adequate amount of sunblock
night along with spf 30 lotion
however i am always left with eyeliner
mascara residue no matter what
i used it to remove my eyeshadow
would recommend you use this cleanser with a moisturizer if you dry skin
moisturizer it would counteract the effects
no moisturizer would help
this is a really nice moisturizer
i would prefer physical sunscreens that last longer
not what i like in facial moisturizer
oh well, i prefer mineral sunscreens anyway.
as soon as i started putting this moisturizer on
it has the texture of sunscreen
i do exfoliate once every morning too.
i decided to try this after seeing tati's skincare review
eyeliner around my eyes
