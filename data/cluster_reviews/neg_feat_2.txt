i switched to this product from the detox sets as my skin was getting very oily
it's about a little three inch square glycerin bar with no soap dish
hoped with the oatmeal ingredients that it would be soaking
before spending the $ i suggest trying cheaper facial oils
not for a rigid skincare routine
however it did zero exfoliation on my skin over multiple treatments
a skin care specialist at sephora told me that polyvinyl alcohol
one of the first ingredients
this is unlike most serums
i like my skincare to sink in more
i like to put on toners
irritated last month due to over exfoliation
more hydrating to use a cream-type cleanser from a pump bottle
i love the 2in1 cleanser from this clinique line
all over-the-counter sunscreens i've tried sting my sensitive skin
it also pills under powders
after cleaning, my serum, and heavy night cream.
get some botox or fillers instead
i'll stick to fillers and botox from now on.
this cleanser completely dried out my skin.
it's an average cleanser
this cleanser didn't do anything for my skin
while this product was cleansing
i kept using the cleanser
it's just a basic foaming cleanser that you could get at the drugstore
it's good for a cleanser
this is a standard foaming face wash.
it's just a foaming face wash.
i switched from african black soap to this exfolikate cleanser
not being able to use really harsh exfoliants
this cleanser made me break out
i would compare the feel to a regular face cleanser from clean
i ran out of my boscia cleanser after the holidays
i'll stick to the anti aging gel for now.
this cleanser is so drying.
it's a cleanser that foams
therefore my hesitation when i buy a cleanser
this cleanser made my skin really dry.
my esthetician told me to ditch the cleanser
my old face moisturizers weren't cutting it
(i use the oils as well.)
josie maran body lotion is the bomb
s of dollars on skincare
the only thing i liked was the sugar exfoliation when i rinsed it off
for using all natural ingredients
does freshen the skin due to the scrub
i don't like the texture of this as a scrub
use an oil cleanser when i don't
no cleanser has done this before
it is a foamy cleanser
since i don't usually mind theirs despite hating perfumey skincare products in general
i've tried a lot of different cleansers since my skin is prone to being oily
i started with this cleanser
uses cleanser once a day
it does lather well
it is very gentle yet effective with cleaning
murad refreshing skin cleanser is non-drying
i used this cleanser for years
i love skincare products
face creams/lotions made my skin so smooth
my reaction after the first use was that my cleanser
their hero salve is my go to moisturizer
i typically use pure jojoba oil on my face as it's the most similar oil to natural sebum
also, i absolutely hate the applicator.
i also got the matcha stick toner
like an orange cleaning solvent for your house
they make a marula oil
for $24 it should have some skincare benefits
eat food with less salt
any fragrance natural or synthetic in skincare products causes internal irritation when used for an extended period of time
i didn't like the fact that it contains chemical sunblock
i used this alongside the clarifying cleanser.
tree tea blemish lotion from body shop worked way better
this was one of the worst moisturizers i have tried from sephora
i tried this because the clarifying cleanser dried my skin out
this basically functions as a mild toner before application of a face mask or other skincare
the instructions are for you to spritz
then cleansing your face of the mask
this works great as a light hydrator
the spray on the bottle is terrible
my toner does the same thing
i really loved the idea of a gentle lather face wash
or skin laundry wash
i absolutely love this cleanser.
in my opinion it's better than the fresh soy cleanser
to me it smells like flea shampoo
it's a good skin cleanser.
despite spending a few minutes massaging the cleanser on the skin to really break up
obviously had to try this cleanser
this facial cleaner works
only saving grace was that it mixes well with sea salt to exfoliate
this is your run of the mill cleanser.
usually use fresh soy cleanser or philosophy purity
i wanted to like this cleanser
this cleanser seems to leave a film behind
for a couple days i thought this cleanser was helping my skin a lot
am trying to find another cleanser
i loved this cleanser initially
all my cleansers are creamy
i love oil cleansing
the double cleansing method
i am a huge fan of bare minerals skincare products
bring back the old cleanser please!!!!!!
one of their new face lotions
having used the old purifying cleanser for years
the old cleanser never gave me any problems
this cleanser was too drying for me
the product didn't lather up
i don't feel like this cleanses my face.
don't feel it cleans my skin any differently from many other cleansers i have tried
this product was the worst face cleanser i have ever tried
so save your money for an actual good cleanser!
i did not care for the texture of the cleanser
i am on to a different line for skincare.
i am also experimenting with a new cleanser
i often experiment with skin oils
i personally don't like my skincare to have much fragrance or any at all
tend to like most oils
a beauty gurus mentioned using it for under eye wrinkles
something about the other ingredients makes my powder foundation
it's very comparable to other high end gel moisturizers
i used make up removal before before cleanser
just wanted some eye massage
i've used a fancl cleansing oil before
the cleansing oil was disappointing
i always double cleanse
this is a good cleanser
it has a "cooling" sensation much like the boscia makeup breakup oil cleanser
you'll definitely love this cleanser
my skin drinks it in
with some exfoliant they went away
not enough coloring in the lotion
i'll just keep using sample packets of face glow to mix in with my lotion
while this is a great cleanser
this is just a milder type of cleanser.
didn't have time to let my skincare routine products sit
i've had a lot of other moisturizers that either irritate my skin or interact with other products
i also purchased the rose foaming face cleanser to go with it
i've tried many other moisturizers from other high end skin care br
i didn't find it to be superior to other hydration serums that i've tried
it's stronger than a lot of body lotions i own even
since it's a gel formula
got this bundled with the purity facial cleanser that i love
i wish it was unscented
why does any facial moisturizer have fragrance or dye in it?
as many moisturizers often are
i like the idea of cleansing
as it is a "cleansing mask"
it's okay as a cleanser.
more like a foaming cleanser
after applying this product in the morning as part of my skincare routine
if it were unscented, i'd be all in.
i usually apply it after my toner/essence
the cleanser itself is great.
this cleanser dried my face out
i knew this was the only skincare product new.
had to try this cleanser after reading the description
unfortunately i cant find a good cleanser for whiteheads
the effects of this cleanser aren't life-changing for me
it does seem to make me more reactive to some of my other exfoliating products
so be cautious if you use a chemical exfoliant of any kind
this is a decent cleanser
the zinc is great i just wish they would have used a milder cleansing agent
especially since most pyrithione zinc shampoos contain fragrance as well
not a fan of water creams or masks at all
clinique seems to be very behind the times when it comes to skincare products
this cleanser made my face
product leaks out of the pump as you try to dispense cleanser
it was just like a silicone primer basically
it's good for locking in other heavy creams
the softening effect is done by the jojoba
it reminds me of a hair salon that specializes in perms
creams i've placed on my face
as i religiously use the algenist cleanser
my normal skincare routine
pump-dispenser are fabulous
a sales person at sephora recommended this eye balm due to my allergic reaction to many ingredients in eye creams
this eye balm was cooling - i'll give it that.
after a nice cleanse/exfoliator i applied the jelly mask on
lotions i've tried are thick
would recommend to someone with oily skin as a slightly cheaper alternative to more chemically based cleansers
it just overdries like most bar soaps do
making post-shower lotion an absolute necessity
after washing my face using it
using it in the shower
i also love that is has no mineral oils or synthetic dyes
it's rather strongly fragranced for a facial product
doesn't soak in as most primers or moisturizers do
i don't even use setting powder
basically need my daily skincare routine as quick
not recommended for ladies with dryer skin types.
i noticed this is the same thing with the same ingredients as my $10 toner
even my toner is cruelty-free
after washing my face
are all of his serums this small?
massage it into my skin
i tried adding the marula oil
should just be called a cleanser
i spoke with the skincare specialist about this product
one of the best smelling moisturizers in my opinion
have tried so many different creams/serums that have not really made any difference
i love clinique's liquid face soap
this is not 1 of clinique's best cleansers.
exchanged it for my other cleanser
i really like this cleanser
the scrub salt or whatever or not strong enough to really exfoliating
went back to my clinique acne solutions cleanser
i doubted this from the start since it's a physical exfoliant
not the best exfoliatior/cleanser.
i think it's silly to put chemical exfoliators in a face wash
however i was really disappointed when it was no where near as exfoliating as clinique's exfoliating scrub
i still had to soap my eyes
exfoliating as separate steps
not for major exfoliation, though.
i love clinique skincare
use all of the following every single day: their take the day off balm remover
the redness soothing cleanser
i liken this to those shampoo
conditioner in one products
skincare should never be scented because that can cause breakouts
i've used other moisturizers that performed better
i would almost rater use a water gel peel
applied my foundation with a beauty blender
but it's a decent cleanser.
cleanser just to get the job done
i stupidly believed it was purging the impurities
it's your basic exfoliate, in stick form.
rather than the little abrasive beads trying to exfoliate my skin
i don't like exfoliating with something that contains harsh beads
after a 4 day vacation using this instead of my normal cream cleanser
this is a harsh cleanser.
the last time i used a beauty blender to apply it
you will need water & a washcloth.
i ended up having to use an exfoliating cleanser to remove it
as a toner it is ok
its more gentle then soap
i get that with most cleansers i use
now i have to use just the cleanser as a liquid instead of foam
have also tried using it in the morning as my only cleanser
as i normally don't like foam cleansers
something was off about this cleanser
so definitely remove the make up first with an oil based cleanser or makeup remover
my skin: combination/39yoscent: really strong soap"
my skin may be just too sensitive for this cleanser
then you try to use it as a soap to wash it off
i ended up using another soap to get this soap off
why do moisturizer manufacturers put scents in their moisturizers
i've purchased cheaper moisturizers from the drugstore that work better
face products should be unscented or at least lightly scented
this is poison for my skin
as my boscia cleanser was a little drying
i used it on my face as my first step cleanser
this cleanser did nothing for me
didn't foam for me at all or have any exfoliating properties
useless step in my skincare routine
use it before creams
with moisturizer after cleansing my face
i end up using another cleanser after it to get rid of the film
i do like other lancome cleansers
the gentle foaming cleanser w cottonseed from clarins
it smells like cream shave.
i tried this cleanser based on the staffs recommendation even though i know foam textiles are not always best for dry skin
even though this face cleanser can be use on sensitive skin
the cleanser itself is okay
this cleanser is effective in removing makeup
this oil makes me want to wash my face with bleach
had to scrub super hard
i didn't notice a brightening effect greater than my purifying face wash
after washing the product off
i finally ended up washing it off with my cleanser
i say that as someone who generally has no problem with scented skincare products
i love the regenerating cleanser.
there are some liquid highlighters
you have to use a silicone applicator
99 cleanser/scrub can do
asked for a good cleansing gel for combination sensitive skin
too strong to use with any serums
like the smell of this cleanser
it's just a basic cleanser.
it's just a simple cleanser that does do a good job of washing my face
i think a cleansing stick is more convenience to use than soap
i ended up using fresh's rose hydrating toner to calm my skin down which helped a little
i love the little massage part
it rinse off clean
like needs to be administered by a trained esthetician
t's probably a chemical mixing issue
it is used in food, skincare and for medicine.
for me it's another step in my skincare routine
new day cleansing grains though
i've used raw honey as a cleanser
my acne didn't change after using this cleanser.
wanted something that has something other than just benzoyl peroxide
i've had better luck with the toothpaste trick.
benzoyl peroxide works better for me
i personally prefer the fresh gel cleanser over this one as it's gentler around the eye area
this product doesn't cleanse well like the other one
another person who wasted 100 points thinking this was the original soy cleanser
i wasted 100 points thinking this was the original soy cleanser
which tends to happen with milky cleansers
the other soy cleaner
even though i use a makeup removing towelette before washing
just by the other cleanser
it may be fine for a regular cleanser.
my face felt fresh after i used this cleanser
this cleanser claims to remove makeup
i also told her i liked using a sample of fresh soy cleanser
the cleanser does a better job at removing mascara than the milk
i'll go back to either the cleanser or another product
i love the soy fresh cleanser so thought i'd give this one a try
it works well in unison with the soy face cleanser
i've used their soy face cleanser for years
however this soy face cleansing milk does not wash off my makeup
smells don't usually bother me in skincare products
i received a sample of emulsion from a saleswoman who steered me to this line after i asked for the location to another skincare line
s add perfume to skincare
this soap was very drying
this cleanser removed my water proof make up with ease
while it does say to massage it in
you just massage into your skin
put some toothpaste on you face
then had to just use another cleanser
had high hopes for this cleanser
i feel as though i could have just bought a drugstore cleanser
i don't feel comfortable using glass bottles in a shower
overall an okay cleanser
yet cleanses very well-natural ingredients
it was a basic cleanser for me.
i really enjoyed using this cleanser
this cleanser is a nice cleanser
read so many glowing reviews of this cleanser
this cleanser was the only new product introduced into my regimen
i will say it's a nice cleanser with a clean scent
i find this to be a drying cleanser
prefer a gentle cleanser that doesn't make my skin any dryer
i switched back to my fresh soy face cleanser
don't use any drying treatments
as far as sephora cleaners go
was on a quest for a new cleanser
i've gotten the same results with drug store cleanser
this cleanser is not for me
smells like cheap lotion that you'd get gratis in a hotel bathroom
the ingredients in it
the ingredients are like a pressed juice for your skin
when using beauty blender it covers my face a bit more natural
i found myself mixing with other serums to make it last more
my holy grail makeup remover
since i like oil-based makeup removers
nor is it unscented.
think you could use a drugstore cold cream cleanser to do the same thing
i do like it cosmetics
the cleanser is very thick
i used this as a first cleanse
followed up with my usual cleanser
i started using it right away bc i'm obsessed with cleansing balms
i've heard so much about it cosmetics
come to find out, it was this cleanser.
i prefer the ease of makeup towelettes to this product
looked at the ingredients only to find mineral oil
i tried applying my foundation over this primer with a beauty sponge
i am searching for a good makeup remover
i love the it cosmetics
it cosmetics, you failed on this one.
i love the it cosmetics make up line.
i love it cosmetics products
it cosmetics makes an eye pencil
i love it cosmetics
why oh why do these companies put heavy scents in their creams???
the only change i had made in my skincare/makeup routine was this product
this was my first skincare product
it comes with a spatula for hygiene which is very nice
my cleanser took more makeup off.
this cleanser made my skin really freak out
this product was the only change in my skincare
t doesn't rinse as clean as the clinique balm
i ended up using a triple amount of cleanser to remove everything
if you want to try a nicer balm cleansers
drugstore one that i like so far is the simple hydrating oil cleansers
this cleanser goes on great
maybe oil balm cleansers are not my thing.
the problem is that the balm doesn't melt into my skin like a sherbert-style cleanser
i'll stick with the oil gel cleansers in this line instead
i decided to try this as an alternative to the clinique cleansing balm i normally use
opted to order the erno laszlo detoxing oil cleanser that was a reward with the order
i really liked the applicator
i never mind a second cleanse after a balm cleanse
didn't turn into a milky film like other oil based cleansers i've tried
i am a skincare junkie.
but, so do many other creams.
like a mini cold massage!
still searching for a replacement from my face lotion that was discontinued
was it really cleaning my skin?
i like the lightweight oil cleanser aspect
doesn't feel like a deep cleanser
used the sephora triple action cleansing powder
i tried this cleanser
my skin does not feel clean after using this "cleanser"
hard to massage into your skin
has a texture almost like an ointment
i liked the texture of the cleansing oil.
this is highly foaming liquid soap with oils added to it
cannot tolerate foaming cleansers
double cleansing is already part of my skin care routine
i would try other cleansing oils if you do
i applied step 2, the cleansing bar.
they chose the detoxify version for me
try some new skincare
when using the combination bar soap
the soap was just a little too filmy feeling after rinsing
i loved the cleansing oil
the cleansing bar was too drying for my skin
the oil part of the cleanse cannot be used alone like other cleansing oil
washed off with an actual cleanser
the oil to this doke cleanse set is really heavy
i still found make up residue when i used toner or cleansing water
then wash it clean with the soap
this cleanser was interesting to try for sure!
it was a bar of soap.
then use the soap
massage it into my face
the oil cleanser is nice
then i don't have a soap dish
i would prefer like a balm cleanser or something to this bar
i really like the bar soap
had to use another cleanser
the bar soap dried my face like a typical bar soap
i still had to wash my face after with a different cleanser
the cleansing oil is nice
the bar soap works fine
though i personally really dislike the bar soap format for facial cleansing
maybe pair the oil with a corresponding liquid cleanser in a pump bottle instead
the concept of double cleanse
i like bar soaps for my body
the cleansing oil is really nice!
the oil cleanser really lingers
i like the duo concept of a cleansing oil
the bar soap isn't harsh
the bar soap had a nice
it counter-acted with my normal skincare routine
i really enjoyed the cleansing oil.
my skincare routine recently includes using coconut oil on my face several times a day in addition to a light moisturizer with spf
i do enjoy the cleansing oil
i love the feel of the cleanser
i love the cleaning oil
the double cleanse concept
i like to give my skincare regime 4-6 weeks
this cleansing set really catered to my sensitive skin
i am very particular about my skincare regime
i like my cleansers to foam when i use my foreo
i plan on thoroughly double cleansing
might even use it as a liquid highlighter
good for eye self massage because of a smoothing effect of dimeticone
i think other brands have better eye creams.
currently use the cleanser
use her whole line for my skincare needs
please make an unscented version because i'd love to keep using it
i normally don't like lotion primers
when my skin is dryer, i love this product.
i'll be sticking to separate moisturizers
i would recommend the coconut micellar for those with dry skin
i tried the rose cleansing milk because it's supposed to be moisturizing
simple cleansing micellar water
it wouldn't even cleanse
the exfoliating beads disappear almost immediately
i ordered the coconut cleanser just to give it a try
it's a non-foaming cleanser
the cleanser was pretty cheap
an exfoliator in the shower gives a better result
typical cosmetic counter product
i tried washing it off in the shower using purity
at the time i was using a cleanser that was too harsh for my skin
i prefer my facial products to be unscented
this was a recommendation by the sephora skincare specialist when i asked for a serum
dimethicone is a horrible ingredient
i feel like i'm smearing drug store sunscreen all over my face
i like a lot of clinique skincare
went back to using the glycolic acid
i used 50% glycolic masks every other week
40% lactic acid peels on the weeks i don't use the glycolic ones
i like pure simple skincare that works
plus the ceramic clay cleanser
it's one of the greasiest moisturizers i have ever used
the other being glossier priming moisturizer
probably because straight up beeswax is high on the ingredient list
make it more liquids by mixing it with my oil free lancôme spf
basic cleanser in my opinion.
on paper this sounds like the perfect cleanser for me
i used this cleanser in t
works like any other cleanser
there are other cleansers out there for sensitive skin that don't have the fragrance that i much prefer
i got this cleanser to use as the second step after using a cleansing oil
typically use the fresh soy face cleanser
just hate that this is called a gentle cleanser
i loved this cleanser at first.
every time i use the soap
there is black in my soap
i tried rinsing the soap out with water to no avail
gross all in one facial cleanser
toner/fresh soy face cleanser
prefer a sulfate free cleanser that lathers
lathering option if that's your preference
product works well at cleaning face
this cleanser works well enough
i think this is a fine cleanser
stopped using the cleanser
i went back to using the cleanser
this has been the worst facial cleanser that i've ever bought at sephora
i needed a detox facial after using this for 3 days
like trying to put glue or toothpaste on your face
you get that chemical sunscreen smell
you can not use this facial cleansing foam on the eye area
rinses off clean- except the essential oils in it are very very strong
the product is watery for a cleansing oil.
this was my first cleansing oil
following it up with the squalene oil helped a bit
like most cream jars have
is i will first cleanse my face
brushes--you name it
have to use another cleanser afterwards
this product feels nice on the skin as a cleanser
this seems like a great cleanser
this cleanser also had 0 effect on clearing up my acne
i wanted to love this cleanser
when i use the toner
this cleanser is very nice
i decided to give this cleanser a try along with the toner
this cleanser is good
t pores no more cleanser
this cleanser really dried out my face after one use
i've tried a lot of different acne cleansers
this is the equivalent of washing your face with perfumed water
i've used many cleansers specifically for oily or combo skin
will use the cleanser until it's gone
this cleanser was nice
the cleanser was harsh and drying on my skin.
along with the toner
the cleanser was my favorite product of the three
it is a foaming cleanser
which is great if you prefer low-ph cleansers
the ideal cleanser ph is 5
i enjoyed using the cleanser
would switch off with my regular cleanser
i didn't change my skincare other than this
i am also using the ole henrikson counter balance cleanser
which probably shouldn't be the case when applying skincare
don't like how the toner or hydrator feel at all
along with the balancing toner
toners that i know work the best for my skin
along with the cleanser
i do highly recommend the balance cleanser from ole
i used it with the cleanser
i do pair it with the cleanser
toner plus the grease relief facial water
so do many other creams
i've used about 5 serums for my fine lines.
use their products almost exclusively in my evening skincare routine
it's the same smell as their cleansing water solution
you would get the same results from using jojoba oil
when i put it on my beauty blender
i've got a very diverse skincare routine so whenever i see new skincare oils that are full of antioxidants i am interested
this is full of chemicals
i looked up the ingredients
later as a skincare treatment
i am surprised that so many people rated it as a gentle cleansing balm
it was recommended to me as a balancing cleanser that would reduce environmental irritation
i switched back to my old cleanser
this product is an effective makeup remover.
i love oil cleansers
the good reason for it is that it is not an oil cleanser
it does not behave as an oil cleanser
it does quite well as a 1st step cleanser
it is just not an oil cleanser.
dioe lost me as a skincare user
cleanser did not meet my expectations
it felt like foaming cleanser from drug store.
i like foam cleansers
if you like a liquid to foam cleanser
this micellar cleanser does a good job of removing makeup
if you don't rinse it off after cleansing
this was the most expensive makeup remover i ever bought
i don't need another 38 dollar exfoliation.
not sure if i would call this "cleansing oil" because i have to double cleanse again with the marble bar or my purity cleanser
massage the left over ampoule into face
i used a lot of oil based moisturizers in the past
who doesn't love tatcha skincare
i usually have good luck with serums with similar ingredients/claims
sticking to my makeup wipes/cleanser
this was the first detox mask i have ever used.
i like the overall idea behind this cleanser
either this cleanser isn't getting my skin completely clean
i shut my cleanser good
i love this cleanser as the second wash in my double cleansing routine
this cleanser was really nice
you'll have the best cleanser ever
was really excited to try a gel cleanser instead of the bars
think this cleanser just doesn't agree with my skin
you waste half of your product on the bathroom vanity
once i stopped using this cleanser
my skin is fairly sensitive to cleansers
i am thankful to have face wash options without fragrences or perfumes
completely removes makeup better than most cleansers i've tried
this "jelly cleanser" has a texture that's like liquid soap
is more drying than the juju bar
almost like i still have residue on my face from the cleanser
this cleanser falls very flat for me
i think calling this a jelly cleanser is very misleading
it's ok as just a regular cleanser
i didn't find the beads to have any real exfoliating effect
the cleanser was decent.
this cleanser is a convenience item.
looks like dirty used deodorant
this cleanser looked amazing.
it has little tiny beads that i believe are meant to help exfoliate
i mainly use this as a post workout cleanser followed by the matcha toner
however i have noticed that the cleanser will probably go faster than the toner so the fact that it doesn't last as long as a gel cleanser
i do love the matcha toner
for me, this cleanser isn't that special.
its not a really good cleanser.
i tested it against other cleansers i use
as my skin dried after cleansing
i usually use the purifying cleansing gel with the konjac sponge in my night/morning routine
it soaps up nicely
works okay for my morning rinse
this cleanser is really great
the cleanser is fairly basic.
it is a blast to cleanse with
i absolutely love this cleanser!
i love this cleanser
this cleanser is extremely disappointing.
seems to deposit very little cleanser
i love the idea of this cleanser
for a basic charcoal cleanse that's insane.
will be switching to a different charcoal cleanser
i've used the cleanser only 5 times
i might as well not use a cleanser at all.
that means you are getting more fragrance than sodium hyaluronate
the large grain is supposed to exfoliate my skin?
i've used it on its own after cleansing
this product was one of the worst cleansers i have ever used
i will say the cleanser felt nice
overall it is a wonderful cleanser
great if it's one of your only potent skincare items
if you've ever used a glycolic acid facewash
than i look online to find people who have ph tested this cleanser
i liked that this was a gel type cleanser
i got this to use as a second cleanse
other cleansers work just as well with more product
it definitely has more skincare benefits than other primers
many of their products have become staples in my skincare routine
this could have been done with a mask cheaper or an exfoliator
this product does contain ingredients that can exfoliate dead skin
i already have a skincare routine that has balanced
after washing my face in the shower
silicone-like ingredients that make it feel greasy
most serums are all natural filled with wonderful oils
this cleanser is unique in the fact that it foams without water
i prefer my skin care products to be unscented
this is not the same as the blue herbal gel cleanser that came in the bigger plastic bottle
super disappointing as this was my favorite cleanser
must be shaken like most mousse dispensers
because when i used a toner
after using the toner
i don't use foundation or powders in the summer
then use this cleanser
i love a good chemical exfoliation or peel.
glycolic acid products depending on what my skin is telling me it needs
way too many chemicals.
i didnt find this cleanser to be any more or less cleansing than other products
his empower foaming milk cleanser
this cleanser would be perfect
compared to other cleansers sephora had
i wanted a new cleanser
it did clean my original beauty blender great too
was a little more difficult to rinse off compared to purity
boscias black detox cleanser is the best i've found out of about a dozen
not the result i would want from a face cleanser
use it as my brush cleanser
i always follow up w/ a toner after cleansing
this cleanser has a strange consistency.
this cleanser is very thick
just like any ordinary cleanser
fresh after i wash it
i tried this cleanser and returned it.
i only feel 'squeeky clean/ when combined with an exfoliation
the scent hasn't bothered me as much as philosophy moisturizers do or even products with retinoids
if this were unscented
this is among the worst moisturizers.
when i tried to massage it into my skin
had to completely cleanser my skin
with so many other lovely serums out there
as the night gel
the new bottles ingredients
i used this in conjunction with the cleanser
i ended up searching ingredients for a lot of moisturizers
generally i dislike most of my moisturizers.
i've tried many many moisturizers
just checked the ingredients
worst texture/smell of any skincare product i've ever tried
and i'm no stranger to heavy creams.
i am a skincare junkie
i love philosophy skincare items
this use to be the holy grail of moisturizers!!
what i don't like is that the product still contains parabens
you get a strong smell of bleach
it's like smelling bleach mixed with s emen
i got this along with the philosophy cleanser
i mix it with other moisturizers or oils to help with the smell
i like other philosophy products like their cleanser
this product works best perhaps after a deep cleansing
i stopped using one of my cleanser
i am always on hunt for an eye cream that's not in a jar for hygiene purposes
i put this gel in the fridge
i got this with a 3 piece gift set which included the grape water spray the quenching serum
or their cleansers left me red
but it would be great as a morning cleanser.
my favorite milk cleanser is no longer stocked
it smells like the worst detergent
using it as a typical cleanser
i need to use another cleanser to wash off the oiliness
it does not cleanse at all.
so - no on the cleanse.
you have to use another cleanser to remove this gentle one's residues
this cleanser is indeed gentle
as with the cleansing water
it doesn't rinse as clean as i'd like
i found this product to be more of a moisturizer than a cleanser
i used it as a cleanser
i definitely wouldn't use it as a cleanser
then this would be a gentle cleanser
as it is more like a lotion than a cleanser
a make-up remover after using this first
i loved the foam cleanser yet decided to try the clean sling milk as i have aging skin
i've tried other milk cleansers at a much lower price
save your money and research a better cleanser.
why make a cleanser that doesn't cleanse?
it still needs to cleanse
also tissuing off the product day by day will potentially over exfoliate your skin
when i used this cleanser
please bring back original perfect cleansing milk
i loved the gentle cleaning milk
however still a light cleanser that works well
take a bottle of regular body lotion
when i use caudalie's cleansing water afterwards
the cleansing milk felt like i was putting thick lotion on my face
absolutely hated this cleanser.
this is the most expensive cleanser i've purchased
this left a residue like old deodorant
i don't feel this formulation cleanses as well.
old formulation removed my mascara beautifully
i used this cleanser faithfully for 7 years
caudalie used to produce another gentle cleanser.
didn't have this with the gentle cleaner product
i wash my face in the shower
caudalie please bring back the original gentle cleanser
i cannot use this cleanser
unless they bring back the gentle cleanser
i immediately re-washed my face with an exfoliant to get it off
happened with their cleansing wash too.
this cleanser has a new formula which left a greasy
the cleanser feels like wax when applying on my face
it took me a long time to find a fab cleanser.
i loved the old caudalie cleansing milk
this cleanser i really didn't enjoy
i would recommend their foam cleanser over this one for sure
usually end up washing this cleanser off with another one
love caudalie's lotions, but not this cleanser.
i did filter for a gentle cleanser because i have sensitive skin
cleanser in one to use at night
i loved everything about the cleanser
i wear clinique superbalanced liquid makeup.
the cleanser is nice
it works great as a morning cleanser.
it left my face so oily i end up using another cleanser to rewash my face
will never ever purchase this cleanser again.
i usually use witch hazel as a toner after washing to make sure i get everything off
no stars for being an actual cleanser
worst cleanser ever tried.
plenty of other cleansers that are gentler
this is a pretty decent cleanser.
i find that it's less tight than a cleanser with sulfates in it
i like this cleanser
i don't think the facial cleanser itself is breaking me out
using this cleanser i broke out daily
was my hg cleanser
i tried this as my summer cleanser since all my makeup artist friends tell me to stay away from gel cleansers due to their intense drying properties
switched to a mud to foam cleanser from glam glow
so when my soy cleanser ran out
after switching back to my fresh cleanser
this boscia cleanser must work wonderfully for many people
this is a good cleanser to remove makeup
liked this cleanser at first
use this with the charcoal cleanser back
forth switching cleansers every day so my skin doesn't get used to one cleanser
it's not doing anything miraculous like i was expecting a purifying cleanser to do
the applicator isn't the best
i do like the applicator
i wish the applicator was a bit more hygienic
instead, i always used a cotton swab.
i love boscia skincare products
get the yogurt cream
i tried other korres night creams
good deal and great value for facial cleanser.
the ingredients in this cleanser are nothing short of appalling
i recommend it for washing your brushes
this cleanser made me break out so much !
i like this cleanser a lot
i try to avoid parabens in my makeup
saw that it contains parabens
would make products that contain parabens
i normally use facial cleansers sold in drug store/ supermarket
i don't get the hype over this cleanser.
this cleanser is safe for sensitive skin
it doesn't take off liquid lipstick as it is a water based cleanser
i just prefer not to have fragrance in cleansers in case it irritates my skin
the good: this cleanser actually cleans without drying
parabens are bad news.
parabens are of similar concern
basically like a dish soap.
this cleanser has a sticky
more like harsh dishwashing liquid
i don't go around eating lots of dish soap
i love this cleanser
so over this cleanser.
whiteheads all came out after using this cleanser
i like the concept of a one step cleanser
wanted a gentle cleanser, this is not it.
i know this is supposed to be a cleanser
this cleanser does nothing for me
i will stick with my foaming green tea cleanser
i don't like this for a full cleanser.
the description of what this cleanser was supposed to do
the smell of this cleanser is off.
i did try to clean my brushes
bought this product in an acne cleansing kit
the gel cleanser was terrible
the "soothing gel cleanser" was the furthest thing from soothing to my skin
maybe not as drying as some cleansers
i prefer a time-saving cleanser
i like the murad time-release acne cleanser better
i think the wash works well as just a cleanser
my skin needs a very mild cleanser.
it's typically because of the cleanser i'm using
i'd heard some great things about this cleanser
used this cleanser for about a week
i stopped using the cleanser
this is a good gentle cleanser for me
bought this cleanser to try to combat the redness in my face
more so than other sensitive skin cleansers
if buying it for a cleanser only, great.
after i started using the murad redness cleanser
was disappointed with this cleanser
but it was a great cleanser none the less
gentle cleanser is great for sensitive skin like mine
this is "unscented" so maybe its just the ingredients that are like a strong detergent
there is some kind of whitening effect
plus it has parabens.
cheaper creams would work just as well.
i don't know if i am allergic to any of the ingredients of this cream
i'll be using the exfoliant from here on out.
you may want to do this as a pre-shower/bath step or you will be washing mud off of your countertops
first of all, it's not soap.
it's a decent body scrub/soap
love this as a daily cleanser and/or mask.
this product is a mask,not a bar of soap.
i really wanted to like this cleanser
this could be the best cleanser ever made
this cleanser does the job
it's fine as a cleanser
does not feel like my face used any product after using this cleanser
it is a good night cleanser
just not my kind of thing to slather my face with health foods
so i had to go on a hunt for a new cleanser.
when i got in store i saw this cleanser
well this cleanser has dried me out even more!
don't like the consistency of this cleanser
its hard to remove it with this cleanser
since the formula is a gel
didn't buy this cleanser
*gentle* cleanser for days off makeup
i would say it is similar to philosophy's purity cleanser
i always use the purity cleanser
had a sample of the fresh soy cleanser
expect no miracles: it is only a degreasing clay
i've used many other exfoliating scrubs before
clarins cleansing milk has worked extremely well for me
i ended up using it as a 2nd cleanser after cleansing oils
this cleanser claims to remove makeup
like most cleansers for dry skin
it feels more like a lotion than a cleanser
use a tonic water thing to remove all the makeup after cleansing
this was the second milk cleanser i tried after the korres version
the negative: this is a not an effective cleanser to remove makeup
irritated by most cleansers that are not milk or oil formula
this cleansing milk does clean
i decided to try clarins' cleansing milk with alpine herbs
this cleanser won't be making any repeat appearances in my skin care routine
the cleanser almost feels like a cleaning oil
this cleanser smears any remaining mascara all over my face
this isn't the normal cream cleanser where you massage into dry skin
it didnt work as well as other cream cleaners as far as getting rid of sunscreen
flaky after using a medicine
i tried also using my beauty blender
i like water creams better.
i even use 2 different powders
even though i removed my makeup with double cleansing routine cleansing brush
it is more like a balm
i may try to use it as a hand lotion instead?
avene micellar lotion to clean my makeup before i use this
if you are deciding between the cottonseed cleanser
something i've never experienced with another cleanser
forget about "super restorative effect"
smells like cheap shampoo
it was just a regular cleanser to me .
this cleanser was great at striping away make up
this worked as a cleanser
this cleanser works as good as any cleanser
i still love the idea of a pore-refining cleanser
this cleanser works fine for oily skin
i hate to have to spend $35 on this cleanser
it will be the purchase of this cleanser
i liked the cleanser the best out of the whole set
i returned this cleanser.
this cleanser work well
it even made my face burn when i applied my other skincare products after cleansing
i used this product twice a day after cleansing
compared to the greek yoghurt moisturizer or sleeping facial
i am using murad anti-aging/acne reducing cleanser
now i use oil-free moisturizers
i cleanse my face then tone and moisturize.
the lotion however didn't measure up.
replaced it with oxybenzone
particularly to products containing any kind of sunblock
while it is paraben-free
i prefer the other murad cleanser.
i went to oil cleansing method
this is the worst cleanser i have ever tried.
to fix i should use this cleanser
this cleanser had glitter (?)
this cleanser is okay
this cleanser is average
i do like it as a hand / body lotion.
i enjoy the body scrub and the lotion for kp.
she does not use products with parabens
i still highly recommend the walnut scrub
sephora staff said this would be a great exfoliant for someone with sensitive skin
mixing in a few essential oils
one of the worst eye creams i have ever used.
my eyes are not usually sensitive at all to cosmetics or creams
what i received was a face-cream jar filled with a pourable lotion
why so many cosmetics
she recommended the korres greek yogurt sleeping facial
i've spent 160 a jar on creams
i've tried a lot of face creams
petrolatum are petro-chemicals that are cheap to produce
the soap cleanses well
this soap cleans fine
sticking with liquid soap
i usually buy the liquid facial soap
i prefer bar soaps to liquid face wash
i usually use the no 3 liquid cleanser
decided to try the soap
this soap worked great my other clinique products
i wanted a simple cleanser to use in the warmer months when i don't want so many "actives"
i suggest getting a more high quality cleanser with good ingredients
it acts like a regular cheap bar soap
all this hype about this facial soap
use a moisturizer that does not contain mineral oils
i think we both prefer exfoliators with scrub beads
isn't this just a toner?
this cleanser doesn't remove it thoroughly
this cleanser stripped my skin of all moisture.
searching for a new cleanser
i switched to the exfoliating pep start fave scrub
as i started rinsing it off
this cleanser strips my skin of all oil
i tried this as an alternative to a harsh acne cleanser
i am currently alternating it with another cleanser just to use it up
this creamy/foamy cleanser is not the best for my skin
in the future i will stick with the comforting cream cleanser for removing makeup
this cleanser was effective at taking of makeup
i will say that this cleanser does a great job of actually cleansing
i tried this cleanser one time
tried all the eye creams from clinique because my mom raves about it
the instructions of the moisturizer say to dispense 1-2 pumps
so does the toner
i prefer most drugstore moisturizers to this.
love the rose toner from fresh
even though i use it after applying a toner
i would never describe this as exfoliating.
this cleanser does remove face product very well
though easily removed with my regular cleanser
i usually use an oil cleanser that takes off everything
i usually oil cleanse
use another cleanser afterwards
this balm made me really have too use two cleansers to get all the makeup
i actually had to use another cleanser to wipe off the extra highlight
the toner on a cotton ball i use from another major cosmetic company showed that the foundation
years ago i used the aha/bha exfoliating cleanser
i really like murad skincare products
i havbe tried dozens of eye creams
their c gel cleanser is very nice
i wanted to love this cleanser
i just recently learned that foaming cleansers are best for oily skin
the instant detox mask
i like this cleanser a lot.
average cleanser in my opinion.
doesn't throughly cleanse my makeup
good for generic cleansing
this cleanser didn't feel like it cleaned my pores at all
but this cleanser makes my skin irritate.
thought this would make a great anti-aging cleanser
you can use it as an additional cleanser after your makeup remover
it's a very gentle cleanser
which is one thing i really like in a cleanser
t is not rich or foamy at all as a foaming cleanser
she told it on the all natural ingredients.
i typically use fresh soy cleanser and i love it.
nothing special as a cleanser
unlike many other foaming cleansers i've used
i find i have to use 3 instead of the 2 pumps i would normally use with other cleansers
normally a bottle of foaming cleanser can last me a good 2 months or so
this cleanser is very gentle
was excited to try this cleanser as i love skin care products
love the caudelie cleansing water
no special ingredients are really in this cleanser
first aid beauty antioxidant cleanser is the way to go for me
it feels like your washing your face with hair conditioner
continued with the cleanser
the cleanser was still drying me out
so use a make up remover before washing your face
i feel like you can purchase a drug store cleanser that works the same
sunscreen using this cleanser
i tried the system so the cleanser along with the toner
i used this cleanser with my clarisonic daily
i've tried a few of the clinique cleansers now
i don't recommend this face wash liquid soap
the cleanser felt nice on my skin.
i tried this cleanser because it said it was good for sensitive/ combo skin
it does cleanse well
this facial cleanser broke my skin out all over my face
as much as i want to love this cleanser
soap for your face
i tried boscia black cleanser
clinique is a wonderful line for skincare.
i tried this cleanser in a set
i got a full size of the mild face cleanser in a clinique gift set
clinique's foaming sonic facial soap does a much better job
then i also like to use an exfoliating scrub at night
its not the best cleanser out there
i slowly stopped using all of the products except for the facial soap
i did not like this cleanser.
based on the fact that this bottle only contains 1 oz of lotion
i used it for one year in combination with the cleanser
i've used drug store moisturizers with those same qualities
i can use toner right after
it does not cleanse skin
returned it because i missed cleansers that foam up
i'll probably try the milky to foaming cleanser
not a great mascara remover
i'll try other cleansers before repurchasing
i felt that cleanser ended up being too oily
however when using it i felt like the cleanser wasn't actually cleaning my skin
the jury is still out on the cleanser.
the fragrance of the cleanser is nice
as well as the toner
it's a great milky cleanser
i didn't change my other daily skincare routines
this cleanser felt wonderful
i normally do not care for creme cleansers
even right after applying toner
i typically use fragranced products on my face
this is the worst face creme ever!
i've tried using this after a foaming wash
don't waste your money find another cleanser/make up remover
i love the cleansing balm from clinique
i usually use the take the day off cleansing balm
this cleanser is terrible.
use a dedicated eye make-up remover for that
the back of the product states you can apply dry with a tissue as a makeup remover or with water like a cleanser
i only use this as a cleanser
i'lll just stick to their normal facial cleanser.
this cleansing milk just dissolve everything.
this cleaning milk feel kinda oily
i usually wash it with water and then with soap.
i am returning back to the rise off foaming cleanser
after using this cleansing milk
purity cleanser to actually get my makeup off
i love clinique's take the day off cleansing balm
decided to try the cleansing milk
this cleansing milk is the worst cleansing product i have ever used
a shampoo/soap that get in my eyes from time to time hurt less
a facial cleanser does better job than this.
if you like the cleansing balm, don't buy this.
i always wash off with a cleanser after
clinique take the day off cleansing balm
or other oil cleansers
very milky make up remover which feel very luxurious to rub on
it doesn't work well as a facial cleanser either.
it is not a cleanser.
it's not a good makeup remover for waterproof products
despite two thorough washings with the product
i will stick with the rinse off eye makeup solvent for removing my mascara
was very dissaoointed in this cleanser
i like the liquid facial soap much better.
definitely have to use a cleanser afterwards
petrolatum contained in its ingredients
after reading a multitude of reviews claiming that this is the holy grail of eye creams
i prefer not to use products with mineral oil on my skin
a frequent buyer of the shiseido skincare line
i needed a good cleansing wipe for after my workouts
i asked the sales person for a very light or fragrance free face washcloth product
these wipes donot work!
not washing my face
i used the cleanser
sadly many of their products contain parabens
more like a liquid rather than lotion
after washing and applied toner.
i never react to face creams
shiseido's bioperformance advanced super revitalizer whitening formula works okay
"whitening" isn't working at all
maybe it was the ingredients that didn't work well with benifiance emulsion
i didn't see any whitening result
initially i liked this cleanser.
this cleanser foams well
double cleansing just to experiment
because i used a gentle cleanser from another br
i no longer use this shiseido cleanser
this cleanser makes my face extremely dry
this product is supposed to do 2 things: cleanse
this cleanser is not doing its primary job
which is to cleanse skin
this is not the cleanser for you
any other foaming cleanser i have used
i love the luxiourious lather though
maybe the emulsion or gel would have worked
no where as near as hydrating as some other eye creams i've used
since using this cleanser my face is not nearly as oily s it is
so what is the point of this cleanser?
i find myself using 2-3 pumps of the gel cleanser
it is not deeply cleanse, though.
the cleanser itself was gel-like
i like a foam cleanser which after you’re done your face feels so clean
after i wash my face i feel like the gel cleanser did nothing for me
this cleanser has been fine
the clay cleanser is working great
get the clay cleanser
natural skin care products
this cleanser left a filmy residue on my skin
this cleanser isn't horrible.
i tried this cleansing milk because i got it in a set
lavendar oil is not appropriate as an ingredient in skincare products for sensitive skin
i noticed that this product left a film like texture on my skin so when i did a second cleanse with my fresh soy cleanser
this is a product you need to double cleanse with
while this product may cleanse skin after all makeup
this one is a "one" for cleansing
clean again before going in with a cleanser
not as harsh as some cleansers can be
this cleanser feels oily
it is not very effective at removing it without significant scrubbing with a washcloth
was recommended to choose over fresh soy wash
i did find the cleanser to be decent.
it was the only cleanser that seemed to agree with my skin
this cleanser not only made me breakout bad
milky like your washing your face with lotion
it left an oily film on my face after cleansing
i tried this cleanser because i have dry
i wash my face in the shower
a cleanser is supposed to refresh my skin
only cleanse my skin with coconut oil
i needed to purchase a gentle cleanser to use with the clarisonic
i no longer have need for a facial cleanser
the cleanser leaves a film on the skin that stays on even after rinsing
rinsing it off and after i used my toner.
i wish sephora carried the bath/body stuff!!
used it as a body lotion just to use it up
i've done the same with other night creams
lactoperoxidase/gluconolactone -- which is the kind of preservative ren should be using if they were seriously "clean skincare
i also picked up their mineral day cream
i saw absolutely no purification of my skin after washing off the mask
i've used better acne cleansers from the drugstore
i love this cleanser
a less costly cleanser should do
i love this cleanser, it works great on my skin.
the old cleanser and new are exactly the same.
5 stars for the cleanser and 0 for the packaging.
the cleanser itself has worked wonders for my skin
the glass bottle is completely dysfunctional for a shower/bath
s down one of the best cleansers on the market
i don't need my acne cleanser to look cute i need it to be functional
the actual cleanser gets 5 stars.
the "soapless" cleanser is designed to be on dry skin which is weird
this is not your average skin cleanser
this cleanser did nothing for me.
reminded me of murphy's oil soap.
in combination with the cleanser from this line
since i loved the cleanser
there are other serums
then adding this to my skincare routine
there are plenty of face creams/serums that have 2% salicylic acid
i used 3 bottles of it
i love the ain't misbehavin' facial cleanser
the cleanser itself was gold man
it's an okay cleanser
frankly it is just too mild of an exfoliator or scrub
loved this product when it was an actual exfoliator
it has micro beads or something exfoliating in it
a drugstore cleanser could give you the same results for a fraction of the price
the cleanser was pretty gentle
i swear by purity cleanser from philosophy i absolutely love it
like if you open a bottle of some of their cleansers or moisturizers
for an exfoliating wash i still prefer the clinique daily scrub or a little baking soda mixed with my regular gel wash
this wash is more liquid
then i directly stopped having a skincare routine
then i directly stopped having a skincare routine
s compared to other "prestige" eye creams
the toner is not great
i only use fresh for my skincare needs.
as i have with their exfoliator in the past
what with their sugar lip treatment
their soy cleanser both being huge pluses in my book
after researching all of the night creams on sephora
then i use the philosophy cleanser in the morning because it's very light
i used this for a few weeks with the liquid lotion
i've used drugstore cleansers that worked better than this
it worked pretty well with my foreo face cleanser
i feel the cleanser is helping
well this cleanser turned out to be terrible
i actually use clinique's oily skin face wash with the acne line instead of this cleanser
i prefer the soap.
i think the soap cleans my face better
i still had make up on after rinsing.
i think i'll stick to philosophy's purity gel cleanser
the cleanser never seemed to fully clean my skin
i'll probably try out a new cleanser!
this emergency gel lotion however is a dud
very comparable to other benzoyl peroxide products
i've used clinique products for most of my skincare over the last few years
this product has benzoyl peroxide
one of the most commonly used ingredients to treat acne
benzoyl peroxide works well in 3%
dries clear unlike most benzoyl peroxide products
is still treated with ziana gel every night
look for something with 2% hydroquinone
nothing special about this gel
my mom had used hydroquinone cream before
the scrubbing beads are so great
i faithfully used two jars of the stuff
luxurious-looking reusable plastic soap container
soap at the sink instead
of acne soap or cleanser in the past as a h
i dislike this soap so much
like i wasn't cleaning at all?
i tried this after i had been using the foam cleanser for a while
i find that in almost every bar soap
i honestly hate clinique skincare
this soap works well on preventing
even after i applied the moisture surge lotion after using it
after rinsing in the shower my skin fealt kind of dry
a good cleanser that felt nice to use.
drug store cleansers are better then this one.
this cleanser is one of the first acne-targeting cleansers i have used that did not dry out my skin
this product is good at cleaning your face
would rather buy a drugstore cleaner.
i just felt like it was no different than using any other drugstore cleanser
this cleanser made my skin flake with how dry it got
i'll stick to the boscia purifying cleansing gel instead
it's a nice gentle cleanser
this is a very light cleanser
i will be switching back to the boscia detoxifying black cleanser
exchanged for detoxifying black cleanser that i used before
had high hopes for this cleanser
i used this cleanser for 3 days
got the origins cleanser which i love
your skin is actually incredibly clean after using this cleanser
the cleanser did a great job of cleaning
i think this cleanser is awesome
i need a cleanser that is not going to add oils to my face
i used this cleanser for about a week
a lot of hype for this cleanser.
however i found this cleanser kind of drying when i first tried it
wash with salicylic acid
this cleanser smelled like detergent
i'd been wanting to try this cleanser
after i started using this cleanser
don't try this if you're used to gentle cleansers like the fresh soy cleanser
i will switch to the boscia detoxifying black cleanser instead
the black detoxifying cleanser
going for a product with salicylic acid in it
apply all over face after cleanser
i prefer benzoyl peroxide formula to spot treat over a gel or treatment to put over the whole face
so the search continues for a mattifying gel
i think 4 weeks to "purge" skin
this works as a cleanser
you would either have to get a makeup remover to use prior to this cleanser
this cleanser is non foaming.
the cleanser feels slimmy like if you mixed a body lotion with water
this is a nice gentle cleanser
i think the "redness reducing" element of this cleanser simply means that there aren't harsh perfumes that irritate the skin
while this product works fine as a regular daily cleanser
i feel like the remnants of this cleanser would prevent the treatment cream from getting to my skin well
it does cleanse your skin
i realize its a gentle cleanser
i also tried rinsing it off
this cleanser does not clean deep enough.
feels like lotion more than a cleanser.
i expected this cleanser
clinique redness solutions cleanser
the cleanser does not dry out
this is one of the only cleansers i've used that doesn't burn
the other is olay basic cleanser for sensitive skin
it's a good morning cleanser
a cleanser it is not
i've tried soon many different moisturizers
or if i had just used the accompanying face cleanser
i also don't use their other recommended products like the cleansing product for redness
gentle milk cleanser is amazing
liquid ran out of the bottle then what appeared to be exfoliant
the worst exfoliator i have ever tried.
i would mix it with my other moisturizers.
recently switched to the murad skin perfecting lotion to get some retinol into my routine
it smells like the other whitening products from shiseido
this product has silicone in it
then a primer before foundation with my beauty blender
received a sample with points- disliked heavy rose scent-i like face lotions to be unscented-used as a h
pilling is my pet peeve with skincare
works great as a makeup primer because of the silicones
this nightime restorative treatment is all hype
i did not find this product to be restorative.
this is a nice cleanser
i personally like to use the dr perricone hypoallergenic gentle cleanser in the winter--the hypoallergenic line is amazing
i know many people like keeping cleansers in their showers
i decided to try the hypoallergenic cleanser instead
the hypoallergenic cleanser leaves me without a trace of makeup
instead i tried the gentle cleanser which is odor-less
texture of the cleanser just feels like cheap product
i prefer cream cleansers.
because i really liked the texture of the cleanser
it smells like my dog's shampoo
there was a distinct powder smell to this cleanser that i could not overcome
also the consistency of the cleanser was not as viscous
this makes me think that the formula of the cleanser has changed
then i got the nutritive cleanser
this cleanser was not a winner for me
this cleanser didn't throughly clean my face
will stick with the citrus cleanser.
this cleanser isn't bad.
at first when i switched from cream to this foaming cleanser
i used this with he firming toner.
i'll tell you what worked wonders though- filler injections
i've never had an allergic reaction to a skincare product before
i normally don't have allergic reactions to skincare products
it is an average facial wash.
i like the cleanser
the store consultant told me that i was maybe overwashing my skin with products that contained salicylic acid
i need a cleanser to remove my makeup.
this facial wash is definitely not a deep-cleansing product
went back to my purity cleanser
after i started using this cleanser
not my favorite wash
what is that....a serum prep...a toner?
i've never been a fan of foaming cleansers
she recommended discontinuing cleanser
the cleanser was too harsh
i wanted to love this cleanser.
a straightforward cleanser that removes makeup
it's an ok cleanser.
thought this cleanser would be great
i switched to a different cleanser
i really didn't like this cleanser
i feel like this is a gentle cleanser.
i think my kate exfolikate cleanser would do a better job deep cleansing
of course, this is after oil cleansing!
i used this cleanser for 2 weeks
this cleanser is very strong
i don't feel any difference from other hydra lotion conpared to this high price
i think because of the cleanser i've been using
i got this product in a skincare value set
i prefer unscented if possible
my dispenser didn't work after
i tried this product after using korres skin creams for years
while i absolutely despise the cleanser from this line
as far as mattifying
i used this after cleansing
this is by far one of the greasiest creams i have ever tried
perhaps other anti-aging creams such as korres wild rose 24-hour moisturizing
like all anti-aging/firming creams
t provides a little exfoliation as you rub the product on your face
the best use of this may be a mild exfoliant for those with sensitive skin
the soy cleanser i will purchase again
was one of my hg cleansers
this cleanser does not remove make up.
i followed it with my toner
foaming cleanser usually works on my skin
after philosophy stopped making their cleanser in a foam
it's an okay cleanser
it works better if paired with a sturdy washcloth or followed with an exfoliating toner
like i cleaned it with bar soap
this cleanser is not good for sensitive skin.
feels like washing my face with perfume
-not a good cleanser for sensitive
this should not be used as a daily cleanser.
i otherwise don't use toner
it reminded my of dial soap
i try to avoid fragrance in my facial routine
not have to rinse it off
doesn't emulsify like the shu umera cleansing oils
as many skincare bloggers state
i've mixed it with out clarifying oils to put on my skin
am testing out new moisturizers
as well as oils
this is a descent serum with a good amount of skin-repairing ingredients
glycolic acid face wash
after getting out of the bath or shower i spray it all over my body rub it in
not more than my drug store gel cream
i think certain drugstore products are far more hydrating than this one
i've found that with most lotions with spf
doesn't claim that this product is paraben-free
it was like a light version of a regular soap.
i love a variety of creams
as do most cosmetic wearers
it's an okay cleanser.
went back to my go-to cleanser of korres yoghurt cleanser
i switched to non-foam cleanser
it is a good face cleanser
this is one of the few cleansers that i absolutely hate
i think this cleanser dry out my skin
this cleanser is foamy
i tried the rose toner
it could be from the cleanser though
this is a horrible cleanser.
this cleanser is so heavy on my skin
i wanted a foaming cleanser for normal/dry skin to use with my clarisonic
while the cleanser works fine with no noticeable excess dryness
it bothers me every time i use the cleanser.
this cleanser is okay- i have sensitive
i only use cream cleansers
and this cleanser is no different.
its not as drying compared to the other foamy cleansers i've used in the past
as well as their anti wrinkle day cream
this cleanser just stripped all oil out of my skin
this cleanser does the basic job
i loved the old gentle foaming cleanser
this cleanser is all right.
i don't think it rinses very well
foaming cleansers strip your skin
especially when i exfoliated or used any spot treatment
this cleanser has a 'squeaky clean' feel to it
this just wasn't the cleanser for me
this cleanser feels like it thoroughly cleans my skin
it's not as drying as other cream cleansers i've used though
the search continues for a keepsake cleanser
thought i'd try this cleanser
this cleanser left my skin super sticky and dry.
this cleanser is okay
i also didn't find it as moisturizing as some other lancôme products
i know lancome produces great creams
that does not use other products with glycolic acid already in them
my skin returned to its normal stage after 2 weeks of heavy exfoliation
it also burns my skin even if i don't use a toner
i normally don't mind fragranced facial products
just needed a daily cleanser
it doesn't control my oil like the cleanser i used previously
a very average cleanser, doesn't do that much.
tried it without the cleansing brush
i wanted to use this product because i tried the exfoliator
as cleansers with too high of a ph strip my skin
the texture of this cleanser is smooth
i used the cleanser very sparingly- less than a pea size for my face
grime my purity foaming cleanser does not
this is not a gentle cleanser
this cleanser is nice
i found that this cleanser does not remove any of it
i would need to scrub
non-drying cleanser for sensitive skin
no worse than a basic $10 face cleansing gel
my biggest gripe with this cleanser is that it has silicone in it
not as good as other cleansers in its class
this cleanser is great
this is a nice average cleanser.
the cleanser stung my eyes
i really wanted to like this cleanser.
this cleanser although gentle was a bit to drying for my almost 50 year old skin
i returned this product for a more creamy cleanser
the green exfolikate cleanser daily foaming wash
wanted to explore her other cleansers
this detox daily cleanser did not help with preventing acne
this cleanser is good- doesn't dry out skin.
ive tried the daily exfoliating cleanser
this cleanser is okay.
i recently purchased the exfolikate cleanser
i used this cleanser for two months
i will say the smell of the gdw is better than this detox daily cleanser
it isn't the best make-up remover
my big problem with the cleanser is the packaging
while this cleanser is gentle
i think this cleanser is just ok.
in fact i almost took this expensive cleanser back
this cleanser is like cheap br
i can't stop comparing this cleanser to sunlight dish soap
now that i switched to a clarisonic with a boscia sulfate free cleanser i am realizing how little this cleanser really helped my skin
i really wanted to like this daily cleanser.
the alcohol is drying
plus i have used the exfoliation product in this line with no issues
this product claims its an "an antiaging hydrator for combination
i wanted to like this product as my skin typically responds well to benzoyl peroxide
which could be from the benzoyl peroxide
love the detox cleanser
at 5% has a bleaching effect
it puzzles me how a moisturizer could be so drying even after toner
mostly because i was unused to smelling this in my skincare products
aloe has dropped down the list
water as the first 5 ingredients
the reformulated product does not sink in nor moisturize my skin
ones that contained aloe
i don't like sticky face lotions/creams!
detox daily cleanser was ok.
hopedt that the cleanser would be gentle yet effective for my skin type
other cleansers out there way better..
this cleanser definitely feel cleaner than other cleansers i've used
i usually use kate somerville's detox daily cleanser which i love
personally i prefer the other cleanser
this is a great cleanser to wake youn up in the morning
this cleanser is nice
this is by far the worst cleanser i have ever used
s on her creams
this product was recommended to me by the salon where i had my facial
it's all the silicone in it
this for me was just an okay cleanser
more effective cleansers out there for less $$
i would use this for basic cleaning
i followed it up with a soft toner
however i have had other good face cleansers
like the philosophy face cleansers
i've switched to the oil cleanser now though
this cleanser has a decent foam
i normally don't spend a lot of money on cleansers
have to resort to my makeup remover al
i've used many cleansing oils
balms in the past
of all the cleansing oil i've used this was the worst
i really love cleansing oils
it feels like you're washing your face in perfume
i like cleansing oils
i love this oil cleanser!
only need one pump to fully cleanse my face
i like how this cleanser made my skin feel.
massage it in then wipe off
i like the way this cleansing oil feels.
i also tried the josie maran argan oil cleansing oil
i just returned this gel product.
i actually have the regular rejuvenating cream
saw this has glycolic acid
if they called it a soothing serum
then recovering the lotion which sprayed all over my h
i wanted to replace my fresh clay mask to both exfoliate
i do not like fragrances in my facial creams
after several weeks of trying out samples of new moisturizers i chose caudalie premier cru the cream
it reminds me of those fish oil pills
this was after i washed off most of it using a softener
i used this along with the scrub cream
i ran out of my other cleanser
in all seriousness its a great cleanser
this cleanser is alright for the money
never had this experience with a face cleanser ever before
i've never really had to battle with acne before using this cleanser
the cleanser itself is fine.
it's a good beginning cleanser
i would say this is a great cleanser
i received this cleanser in the fab holiday boxing day sale set along with their facial radiance pads
it suds up pretty good compared to the lotion facial cleansers i have tried through sephora
mascara is the major test for any cleanser
i really wanted to like this cleanser
this cleanser was just average
i needed a new cleanser
i envy them because this is a great cleanser
i agree with people who recalled this as a basic cleanser
did it's job at cleaning
rate: 3.5overall, it's a nice basic cleanser.
i've used this detox eye roller exactly as directed
acted like a major exfoliant
i got this cream in a kit including the cleanser
this should not be marketed as a face lotion.
i do like it as a body lotion since it absorbs well
i am using it as a body cream
it reminded me of hair bleach.
is used as a preservative/fragrance booster
ful of other moisturizers at the drugstore that i like better
especially since i love fab cleanser
s red clay cleanser
it's a nice cleanser however
i've decided to make an appointment for a dermatologist instead
with this the water-based cleanser usually had nothing to get
my skin just couldn't deal with this cleanser
i've tried many oil cleansers
oils into my skin
got it to get rid of the water-resistant sunscreens i use
try a toner afterwards for best results
because it's water-resistant the instructions recommend an oil-based cleanser with it
i'd use a foam cleanser after the cleansing oil
pump all cleansing oils into dry h
use other cleansing oil for the sunscreen
only after two washings
retinol last ingredient behind even perfume
has a few comedogenic ingredients in it.
with the exception of his microdermabrasion exfoliant
it smells very close to the sulfur containing acne creams
if you are sensitive to silicone ingredients
had also recently tried several oil cleansers as free samples
left behind an oiliness that i used a cleanser to remove
then this is a great oil cleanser
i like oil cleansers after using my makeup remover wipe because i feel like it gives me a good deep clean in my pores
it's just not the best oil removing cleanser
their charcoal makeup remover balm is wayyyy better than this
my overall skin texture has been improving dramatically from using this product in combination with the detoxifying black cleanser
does not leave the skin feeling "purified" as promised
for those not planning to moisturize after using a makeup remover
i do like their warming cleanser.
i love my boscia detoxifying black cleanser
i am a skincare junkie
i re-washed my face with a different cleanser afterwards
the detoxifying black cleanser
after trying the clinique take the day of balm
i decided to try boscia makeup-breakup cleansing oil
after using the boscia black detoxifying cleanser
by the time i rinsed the cleansing oil off there was not a trace of makeup left on my face
i usually remove my makeup in the shower with cera ve lotion cleanser
depending on the mascara sometimes i run a cotton swab with makeup remover under my lashes after i shower
for waterproof mascara i remove it first with waterproof eye makeup remover then cleanse as usual
in the shower with the konjac sponge
as well as setting sprays
i love the toner
my dermatologist has a cleanser with similar ingredients
than with any other cleanser
i started using this cleanser after a youtube beauty guru's recommendation
my aesthetician wanted me to use this instead of the clarifying cleanser murad makes
found that it did not clean my skin nearly as well as the clarifying cleanser
i used the other acne cleanser before this one
i will be returning to the other acne cleanser pronto to fix what this has done to my face
the consistency is like a gel toothpaste that is the only way i can describe it
i hate the feel of this cleanser just felt like a lotion disney feel like it was cleansing anything
thanks to this cleanser i found out i have an intolerance to salicylic acid
check your skincare ingredients
this cleanser did not make my skin feel clean
having worked in the skincare field
have found the glycolic 10%
had been sampling a few new cleansers
after finding the perfect cleanser
smells like any other regular lotion you could purchase at a drug store
i used baby lotion as an alternative at one point
i love clinique's skincare products
compared to other eye serums
massages the eye area well
this is more a cosmetic than a skin treatment.
i do like the super restoring cream
it works as well as other moisturizers
i immediately looked at the bottle thinking i accidently put perfumed lotion on my face
the cleanser is rich and it foams up very well.
thought i'd splurge on this cleanser
used to use two of the other foaming cleansers
doesn't seem much less drying than other foaming cleansers
my skin seems to be dry easily from those types of cleansers in general
so the hypoallergenic was necessary?
the cream or gel products just don't measure up to me
this is the holy grail of eye creams
i went back to ultra repair lotion
i like this because it has skin lightening ingredients
i love the cleanser
if i rub my face after putting it on i can rub off excess skin mixed with lotion
have been very impressed by their other lotions
i love first aid beauty ultra repair creme
the daily application of topical medication was really drying out my skin
reminds me of chemical hair dye
i should not that i am on topical acne medicines which can be drying
i used this moisturizer after using the clear complexion cleanser
i got this with the cleanser.
i really wanted to like this cleanser
super gentle cleanser that definitely gentle
the one positive thing i will say about this cleanser is that it did feel moisturizing
i didn't hate this cleanser
this cleanser just did not work me for
i would have to cleanse my skin again
didn't cause an interaction with any of my masques however my face felt dirty i've used clay masques
i found this cleanser did not remove any residue on my skin at all
my toner soaked cotton swab revealed that all my makeup was still there
was referred to this cleanser by one of the sephora employees when i found that my usual cleanser was drying my skin out too much
i paired this clay cleanser with ren's hot cloth cleanser as a pre-wash to remove my makeup
i love the hot cloth cleanser by ren because it makes my face feel clean
i will be returning this cleanser though.
this cleanser is ok.
still continue to have them after using this cleanser
how soft my skin feels after i use this cleanser
that is if you pre-cleanse!
would use a charcoal soap cleanser
after using this cleanser i had more breakouts around my chin
i tried this cleanser
i really wanted to like this cleanser.
this cleanser just didn't cut it for me
to check i used a cotton ball with remover on it after i had used this cleanser
i plan on using that with another cleanser.
except for that clay cleanser
i put this on after cleansing
i applied it after washing
i wish it were unscented!
i applied it after shower
i've tried many serums in my life
i tried the two week sample with my usual skincare routine
stopped using cosmetics in that area
this creamy cleanser might be for you
i've used a lot of cream cleansers
so many other cream cleansers do the job much better
this cleanser is very gentle on the skin
it kind of defeated the purpose of a gentle cleanser
it feels like lotion mixed with water
other cleansing products tend to dry out my skin
because i use shu uemura's cleansing oil to wash my make up off
a less expensive alternative to shu uemura's cleansing oil
dior apparently decided to split their original cleansing milk product into a sensitive skin
because it has comedogenic ingredients
while i generally prefer to stick to skincare products from skincare lines
the only thing i changed in my skincare routine was this product
i found that this lotion has a lot of ingredients including retinyl palmitate
i am not one that uses only skincare products for sensitive skin
this wash is hard to rinse off
this soap is very luxurious
when i use toner on a cottonball following washing with the lathering tube soap
the beauty balm twice a day
they took out the spf ingredient
they have a wide range of moisturizers that contain shea
as long as you don't use any moisturizers or makeup over it
after washing or a shower
it does soothe my skin after using makeup wipes
i feel like i have to overuse lightweight lotions
em with wrinkle revenge 1 facial cleanser
the applicator was fine
i don't like when my moisturizers smell like straight up perform
would love it if it was unscented.
winter with no paraben
gels in the past
there are other creams
serums that smell better
found that with my current cleanser
in conjunction with a clinique skincare regimen
i tried this product because the "pore minimizer refining lotion" was discontinued by clinique
the former pore minimizer refining lotion was the best oil-free primer i have ever used
have been using perricone nutritive cleanser
i get much better results from lancome serums.
sample of the algenist overnight restorative cream
facials once per month to control these problems
there are plenty of other anti-aging moisturizers on sephora
works great alone or over other serums
i got this as part of an algenist kit with a cleanser
have used the balm religiously
i couldn't live without my algenist melting cleanser
i tried mixing it with an eye cream
tried blending it with my eye cream
mixing it in with cream
this was my first ever cleansing oil
i hate to judge all cleansing oils by one
the cleanser is a little bit off for me
i used bare minerals cleansing oil before this one
i find the fresh soy cleanser to be a better make up removing cleanser
i love oil cleansers
i do prefer a higher quality clean feeling in a cleanser
it does create a good lather for a cleansing oil.
i liked josie maran's argan cleansing oil mostly.
i think this cleanser works well once warm water is applied
in general i like oil cleansers a lot.
this was effective enough for cleansing my face
much more than i need of the other cleansing oils i've tried
the smell lingered on my face after using the cleanser
i do not use this product as my first/only cleanser in my routine
as a cleanser, this works well.
this is one of the worst cleansers i have ever tried
this was the first oil cleanser i tried.
it works great at removing all makeup compared to other oil cleansers
i love cleansing oils
this one doesn't cleanse your skin
i used a cotton round with some toner after washing with the argan cleanser
this cleanser oil is too heavy.
i prefer a lighter oil cleanser.
it is easier to massage
doesn't cleanse the skin well
this truly is the worst cleansing oil that i've ever tried
instead of being a traditional cleansing oil
worst cleansing oil i've tried
which is absurd for an oil cleanser
pretty sure this is a traditional cleanser masquerading as a cleansing oil
i switched up my skincare
not the best ingredients
i love benefit cosmetics
preformed just like any other creams/lotions you can purchase anywhere does
make this unscented please!
skincare is not benefit's strong suit
which i haven't found with other eye creams
after that i cleanse
i like the natural ingredients in it
even then i've used drug store creams that were better
love the ultra repair cream!
i love this cleanser
i wanted the right cleanser for exfoliation
a sephora girl recommended this cleanser to me when i asked her about facial exfoliators
just a basic gentle cream cleanser.
it's not any better than a natural drugstore exfoliator
it applied smoothly on top of my other regular serums
i won't ever use ren's skincare
i don't care for tinted lotions so strike one against this
t's often combined with other sunscreen ingredients
i highly recommend researching chemical sunscreen ingredients to learn more
i prefer a balm cleanser or one that doesn't lather
i wash my chest with my facial cleanser
use my facial skincare on it
this facial cleanser over stripped my skin.
went back to my favorite ren ultra calming cleanser that has more creamy than this
i tried the citrus cleanser
decided to try the gentle cleanser because of the reviews
i absolutely love the nutritive cleanser
this cream also has some ingredients that are skin irritants
have had a similar non- experience with one of the ptr eye creams
i wanted to lighten them without using hydroquinone
luxury spa experience to cleanse face with this
yet this cleanser does not clean my pores right
it was decent as far as oil-based cleansers go
i immediately scrubbed it off with my regular cleanser
there are far better cleansers than this.
unfortunately i did not like this cleansing balm.
i couldn't find the mitten used for this cleanser
use the cleaning cloth from evelom
i can't clean my cleaning cloth then
evelom cloth won't work well with this cleanser.
at first i wanted to give a try to this expensive cleanser
this cleanse balm is too heavy for me.
i tried to wash it
i tried using this like i would a normal cleanser
when i cleanse it
i want it thoroughly cleansed
ready for my face spray
i received samples of the thermal cleansing balm
i mean there are a lot of balm cleansers that don't rinse off with water
i enjoy clinique's cleansing balm
i generally think that cleansing balms are over priced for their purpose
but certainly not a cleanser.
there are other cleansers that are simpler to use that don't smell like sushi
i don't like this cleanser.
i also spent the entire time i was using this cleansing balm
i did not _at all_ like this cleanser.
i received a sample of this thermal cleansing balm
i expected this to be warm since it says it's a thermal cleansing balm
i am a fan of cleansing balms having dry skin.
my favorite is emma hardie cleansing balm
i even used a wash cloth to scrub my face while rinsing it off
this cleanser was just alright for me.
i used a makeup wipe after using this cleanser
this cleanser left my skin clean
so 3 stars for the cleanser.
like chemicals or plastic or
rather that it is "unscented"
this is an okay cleanser
going back to my clinique facial bar soap
this is a decent cleanser.
this cleanser made my skin very clean.
this cleanser stung my skin
this cleanser has good reviews.
tried this gentle cleanser
this cleanser was nice.
over all this is not a bad cleanser
it didn't rejuvenate my skin
the smell of the cleanser is off putting
it's no better or worse than any other facial cleanser i've used except for a soy product that even removes my water-proof eyeliner
it made me feel like i was coating my face in cheap perfume
including the cosmetic cop
i decided to give algenist overnight restorative cream a try
but i do know my skincare products.
i don't feel like my skin absorbs it the way it does with most lotions
i've had no issues with any other clinique lotions
this cleansing water worked
i used this in place of my normal cleanser followed by belif aqua bomb
due to trying a new facial cleanser
this cleansing water really does work
i don't like to feel like i'm cleaning my skin with mostly perfume
unscented product next time
one the consultants told me to use the dermaclear to help remove lipsticks i've tried on
was looking to purchase the waterproof eye makeup remover
in the store to remove some liquid eyeliners
i do need to rinse afterwards because if i've removed lipstick i can taste a yucky chemical taste
i still rinse/wash my face.
you want to cleanse your face
i tried using it instead as a morning cleanser since it's advertised as a no-rinse cleanser
i switched back to my usual cleanser
unless you plan to go in with a second cleanser
i feel the need of rinsing my face after use.
actually it smells like nail polish remover
as most modern eye creams do
this cleanser feels super dooper soft on your face
i love origins skincare
bought one in a skin care kit
this is one of the worst cleansers i have ever used :
it has that cheap soap residue feel
it was my first time trying a non drug store cleanser
not my favourite cleanser at all.
sticking to simple drug store skin care
this cleanser doesn't fix it
this cleanser works very well on sensitive skin.
i think foaming cleansers tend to dry out the skin
however i get the same results with toothpaste
the cream was washing off
i am sticking with their ginzing energy-boosting moisturizer
this is not a bad cleanser
i prefer the checks and balances cleanser.
i wanted to try a different cleanser from origins for aging skin
this was the worst face cleanser i've ever gotten
i like the idea that this cleanser helps with free radicals
i also need to use an exfoliate cleanser once a week to get a deeper clean
i like that this cleanser really purifies
this cleanser, for me, is just "okay."
i would have better off using a bar of soap
i can also get that getting with an exfoliating face wash
i tried using cleansers instead of a warm
it was paraben free
some ingredients in this cream make your eyes sting
i am not a huge fan of this cleanser.
i got a new pimple every single day since i started using this cleanser
philosophy clear days ahead gel cleanser
it definitely helped cleanse my face
this product doesn't work for me as pore cleanser
love origins but this cleanser broke my skin out
i used this cleanser up quickly because i hated it
it paraben free though so perhaps i will try a different cleanser from them in the future
i need a little more oomph to my facial cleanser
when i first bought this cleanser along with the toner
this cleanser doesnt state the percent of salicylic acid
i feel the same after i rinse off
after i rinse off
i really like the ingredients
way too oily for an oil free lotion
this made my face less oily throughout the day compared to other moisturizers i have used before
opted to try out this origins lotion
i found that this product makes my skin purge
dry using this treatment
tt if your on a budget just put some white toothpaste on the pimples
regular toothpaste does more for me than this did
it doesn't moisturize throughout the day as it claimed
drunk elephant moisturizers as a replacement
i tried this gel.
experimented i didn't use very much skincare just the sheseido toner
not my skin care products
mostly from tanning for years
the product used to be referred to as an "exfoliant"
i personally think the turnaround night cream works better at healing dry skin
i cleanse my face very good with the same products
the cream has a very strong nail polish remover like smell
this is certainly not a bottle for the bathroom counter or vanity
although i haven't used any other type of facial serums i definitely have facial products that i'd prefer using over this one
the wrinkle revenge eye balm from an aggressive dermadoctor saleswoman
i am a skincare junkie
i am not a fan of perricone cleansers or toners
the product has silicones
this was the only new item i added into my skincare
maybe because i like cream cleansers
maybe it's just my skin detoxing
this cleanser was ok.
i recommend the makeup breakup cleansing oil
while i don't believe this cleanser made my skin worse
it didn't cleanse very well
this was one of the few cruelty free moisturizers in my sephora
unfortunately i got the pomegranate toner
my skin would just drink this product
it pills up as i rub it in
found glycerin is one of they key ingredients
i am allergic to some of the ingredients
i love this cleanser
loyal customer of the ren cleansing balm
this would be a good option for a natural cleansing balm
i will be searching for a new cleanser.
i am a big fan of cleansing oils
does not rinse clean
goes on as a balm
this cleansing balm works well to remove makeup
this cleanser is really thick
unlike the cleaning oil i use
used this cleansing balm as directed
rodial cleansing balm is by far the best
i usually use cleansing oils
i question having to spend almost $50 on a cleanser
unfortunately, this isn't that cleanser.
it doesn't wash clean
have to use another cleanser to remove it
the new no 1 cleansing balm by ren is great in terms of smell
smells a bit like aerosol shaving foam
it felt all like chemicals
i got this in a kit with the toner
face creams in our facility
after reaction to this cream i cannot use any cream for months
i only use this at night to hydrate my skin after cleansing
which is unique for a lot of creams
i'd get more out of a tube of toothpaste.
the clinque gel works better
i found this to be similar to the belif creamy cleansing foam
it smells like fabric softener or laundry detergent
i changed my skincare
it does purify your skin
most creams irritate my skin
this cream kind of pampers the skin
i even used it with her spray.
the reality is--this is a cleansing foam
fragrance isn't cleaning your face
as for cleansing, this is a luxurious experience.
have tried incorporating into my multi-step skincare routines
the ceramic clay wash is my absolute favorite
this along with the cleanser burnt my skin
i've had much better success with glycolic acid products
that's not what i care for in a skincare product
i've used many other types of exfoliating
a better cleanser than fresh soy face cleanser
this cleanser was one of the top things on my list
this cleanser though, is not that great.
f you're one of those that want your cleanser to foam
i got a sample of the fresh soy cleanser which is like no more than 30 dollars
each time i end up using another cleanser to really clean my face
i tried using this cleanser twice
i see more results using a mild exfoliant
as a cleanser, it does the job.
when i use my toner afterwards
it wasn't horrible as a cleanser
this is not a cleanser.
i ended up using my other cleanser
this cleanser is overly
my $12 cerave foaming cleanser is on par
i get good cleansers for less than 10$ at the drugstore
really any cleanser can do that
it sounded like a true miracle cleanser with all the right ingredients
i've never paid this much for a cleanser in my life
this cleanser made my skin feel soft without drying
i felt like i needed 2 pumps of the cleanser each time because it doesn't lather as well as other cleansers
also didn't like that the cleanser separated in the bottle
the clinique 7 day scrub
until i switched out my exfoliating scrub for the 7 day scrub
i went back to my normal exfoliating scrub
i decided to start using murad cleansers
i like that it's more natural than most other anti-aging skincare products
silicone and acne products don't work together.
i do use cleansers that have that ingredient in it
it's not drying like most treatments
i would massage it into my skin
i mainly use this as a night creme after i do my heavy cleansing because it is so moisturizing
massaged in any excess serum to get the most out of the treatment
thought it was for use like my other wrinkle treatment serums
chemicals that irritated my skin
did not work well to hydrate after using the peter roth cleanser that was very harsh on my skin
nothing that separates it from other moisturizers
this product is dryish and pasty like toothpaste.
if you are sensitive to fragrance in skin care products
cleansing milk in the morning
aside from my skin being additionally moisturized since including this product in my skincare refining
old-school bath-oil pearl
i love face oils and oils to put on my skin.
it just did not impress me as some of the other caudalie oils/serums
use my own designated sunscreen
like for my skincare products to be soothing
cleansing properly as well
use many other rich moisturizers without breaking out
applicator is more hygienic than the pots
an organic facial later
i used this product one night after cleansing
i decided i needed to cleanse my face
even resorted to regular old calamine lotion
with less healing time
most sulfur based skincare does not work well for me
i am still on the search for the best blackhead remover
i would test it out if you've tried benzoyl peroxide
without the residue i've had with other creams
i do tend to like unscented lotions
prefer creams to gels and found it ineffective.
the new bottle is much more emollient
i will try samples of eye creams before committing to a full tube
this lotion was given as a sealed sample
i'll stick with the ultra repair cream.
i love the packaging of this lotion.
ptr has far better creams than this one
true old formulations back?
combined with the toner
even microdermabrasion hasn't worked
anyway avoid lancome for all skincare products
it pills when i try to rub it in
i found it moisturized the same as much cheaper products i've tried
compared to other mosturizing creams i've used this one has a more watery
i prefer skii facial treatment cleansing oil over this product
i loved this cleanser when i used it
it had triclosan in it
this cleanser is lovely
i really had high hopes for this cleanser
this cleanser was a real disappointment.
was so glad to have experienced this cleanser
it was my first experience using a cleansing oil
no yucky feeling like some other oil cleanser.
i always have to use another cleanser after i clean my face with this oil
it felt odd having an oil cleanser
not much better than a facial oil cleanser from the drug store
i used it like any cleanser
although most of my cosmetics/facial care products are usually hidden away in my drawers/medicine cabinet
this product has found a home right next to the toothbrush
i tend to need creams with more hydration in addition to oil-based ingredients
after using a great many eye creams
it's just like the cleanser which is cheaper
the cleanser will do what this mask treatment does
pros: i've tried moisturizers in the past that had faint chemical smells to them
it is mostly unscented which is nice.
i prefer non scented face lotions
face creams with smells are ok
this cream has no dermatologist-recommended or tested anti-aging ingredients
its preventative, not restorative.
as i use the fresh cleanser
i loved all the other moisturizers from miracle worker line
was hoping this would be a lesser alternative to botox or other $100 creams
as recommended by the skincare associate
i already exfoliate on a regular basis
i saw it had glycerin in the ingredients
had previously only used creams intended to hydrate
i usually use liquid face oils
so will cheaper lotions
it is a nice unscented
this masque didn't feel much like a masque.
it reminds me of a hair salon
the next day morning i have to use cleanser to wash out this mask
it smells like medicine a dermatologist would prescribe
had to return it along with the cleanser.
it goes on like other facial oil products.
than other oils i used
i really wanted to like this cleanser.
i find this cleanser too drying on my skin
i do think this cleanser leaves my face softer.
it's recommended to use cream cleansers
always look for foaming cleansers that usually advertise for all skin types
origins organic foaming cleanser cleans much better than this
hoping it would be a great cleanser/makeup remover
soap-like film left on your face after washing
use two different topicals
won't use it unless i ran out of other moisturizers
especially in my skincare
this cleanser is nice
do not try cosmetics with rose extract
i may look elsewhere for my skin cleansing products
does a good job cleaning
buy my soy face cleanser
the toner is okay
this cleansing foam doesn't seem to work with my skin
this cleanser is a bit to light in texture
the foam cleanser is very soothing
this wash cleanses well
really didn't clean as well as cleansers that were more gel based
like the soy cleanser
love fresh soy cleanser too
i think the soy cleanser is much better.
i love fresh's soy cleanser.
i realize that the soy cleanser states that it does
cleanser remover wipes all the time
i am going to have to bleach it out of my pillowcases
be very careful with garments that you may not want to bleach
my skincare regime is my "me time"
switched back to the other creams now
i know self-tanning moisturizers can have a funky smell
i am not normally sensitive to cosmetic smells
like the moisturizer i revived this as a sample.
fragrance doesn't belong in good skincare.
wash the cream off
they moved the preservatives
compared with other moisturizers i've tried
i then purchased the cleanser
i'd say my rec would be the refreshing cleanser
there are many many moisturizers, cleansers etc.
using nightly after cleansing
i seem to be on a skincare brigade recently
because of the natural ingredients
this cleanser is ok
i don't feel like this cleanser removes my foundation completely unless i use another cleanser prior to using this
or some sort of bleach or something
borghese state of the art mascara
the beads in this cleanser are not the best for daily use
wanted to love this when i received a sample as i use the purifying cleanser from the br
would not recommend for everyday if your skin is irritated by physical exfoliation
so my skin is sued to exfoliation
this cleanser was recommended as a daily cleanser
would have been better if i needed a twice/week exfoliant
i got this cleanser because it was recommended to me
as it is both a cleanser
an exfoliant in one i decided to give it a try
i always felt the need to wash my face with a foaming cleanser first
i also use bobbi browns oil cleanser before the oh
which i am just not ok with for a cleanser
it is a light exfoliation for everyday use as it claimed
this is a no-foam cleanser with tiny scrubs.
this is a pricey cleanser
i love the fact that it's a cleanser/ exfoliant
i felt like this would be a great in addition to my acid toners to keep my skin clear
the cleanser is good
the cleanser is fantastic as the 'second cleanse' in my routine
this is nice cleanser with grains in it to help gently exfoliate
which is a great bonus for a facial cleanser
even with using top clean ingredients is just too much for a daily exfoliating cleanser
it stays greasy including overnight or even using after exfoliating
reminds me of the all natural products used for facials
it is like smearing greasy perfume all over your face
this cleanser does the job
this usually happens with really foamy cleanser
more of a debrasion that cream wash
how can they put sparkle in a cleanser
figure out how to formulate it with parabens
revitalizing supreme face cream
this was the only new product in my skincare routine
not like typical oils/serums
it doesn't smooth or calm my skin as well as other less pricey serums
a lot like estée lauder's soft clean foaming cleanser
in conjunction with a good exfoliation will achieve everything this product claims to do
i've become more into my skincare
had to mix with lotion and use on hands.
a great cleanser for the summer
revitalizing supreme face cream
revitalizing supreme face cream
this cleanser is so over scented it bothers me.
it works okay as a cleanser
feels like old lady face cleansing cream.
before it was a combo cleanser/mask
which is much more of a skincare staple to me than a face wash
this is not the perfectly clean cream cleanser i have loved
not for winteri had to return however the product range does have other more emollient moisturizers
i like using micellar water as regular cleanse
i found this cleanser to be a bit drying.
use it after your cleanser as a toner
this is the worst micellar cleanser i've ever used
this cleansing water is just that
only use it at night as a toner
this is good as a gentle remover or toner after a main cleanser
not a heavy duty remover
so i had to use an oil based remover.
i tried using it as the gym cleanser
it's sold as a soap-free makeup removing cleanser
to me this item is more of a toner.
this used to be my go after cleansing.
i remove my makeup with oil cleanser or balm
a double-cleanse with a cleanser is more effective
i see this more of a gentle-cleansing water
i used this from the sephora collection of cleansers
the product is honestly a basic honey scrub.
yet again so does most honey scrubs
the lotion was so hard to be absorbed on the face
the oily formula loaded with detergents
i accidentally bought the lotion instead of the gel
i used this after cleansing
i used this after the clinique foamy acne solution cleanser
i've tried numerous clinique lotions
i only use it mixed with other lotions at night
i used this with a clinique face wash for 2 weeks
this works well as a brightener
i felt like i was putting perfume on instead of a good facial product
i like the cleanser
it was probably the fragrance in the cleanser.
i like the boscia purifying cleanser a thous
grabbed a sample from the store as i'm picky about my moisturizers
apply this right after the ibuki cleanser
it really is as strong as dousing yourself with perfume
if a version of this was made that was totally unscented
ordered this after cleanser
wish they had kept the skincare fragrance because it was much milder
the instructions say not to rinse after use
i think my skin responds better to benzoyl peroxide as an active ingredient instead of salicylic acid
this definitely cleanses it
i much prefer my purity cleanser.
i've tried a lot of different cleansers
there aren't that many beads in this cleanser to call it an exfoliator
i hate that feeling when i rinse off a cleanser.
pay attention to the ingredients in your skincare
may buy those to use with another cleansing balm
my combination skin does really well with oil cleansers
it wasn't a detox period
this product does not rinse off
the cloth kept becoming saturated with cleanser
after cleansing i used my erno laszlo toner
it's the only toner in the house
i am not sure about that greasy cleanser
i so badly wanted to love this cleanser as it seems to be a hero cleanser for many
the cleanser seem to work ok
the whole hot washcloth ritual can be relaxing
extremely expensive cleanser for no real cleansing
i tried using it for facial cleansing massages
this cleanser was nothing special to me.
i can achieve better results using coconut oil to oil cleanse
i loved this product until i did some research on lanolin
one of the main ingredients in this cleanser
the deep massage ritual
this cleanser contains lanolin
this never happens unless i've introduced an irritant to my skincare
cleansing job are out there
from fresh's soy to shu uemura's cleansing oils
this was the first balm cleanser i ever purchased
unlike natural plan oils
now, about 75% of my cleansers are balms or oils.
i prefer lighter cream cleansers
the big deal about mineral oil or paraffin is that it's a by-product of petroleum
it feels like a spa treatment.
which is disappointing because i love their cleanser
i wanted to try this product because it is famous for cleanser
great cleanser by all means.
even after a thorough rinse
i wish that this product was unscented because it would definitely be my go-to cleanser
did not exfoliate or properly cleanse my skin
i noticed this formula was changed from gentle foaming cleanser to creamy cleanser
wish the foamy cleanser was back.
truly dislike this cleanser
this cleanser is very thick
this is more of a cream cleanser
definitely not a foaming cleanser
i usually like cream cleansers
i don't really feel like this cleanser even cleans my skin
it's definitely not a good evening cleanser
i don't really even like to use it as a morning cleanser
this is definitely a gentle cleanser.
is more like a cleansing cream
i do like the simple plastic bottle.
so my skin routine is using a gentle soap to remove makeup
i can get that from a drug store cream
i generally like the serums by lancome
however the products still contain parabens
i must follow with a toner
the murad cleansing cream was recommended by an associate
after washing my face with this cleanser
this is really not an exfoliating cleanser either
again, i wanted to like this cleanser but .
good cleanser but i do not care for the scent.
a sephora rep recommended this cleanser because i was breaking out
this cleanser dried my skin out
this cleansing cream seemed to be ok.
i feel like i might as well use aloe
in fact seem to be dryer after rinsing away this product
thought i'd use it in replace of my usual mask after exfoliating
the cucumber cleanser is holy grail
don't waste your money, buy aloe.
the only reason i got this cleanser as it said it is 3 in cleanse
it doesn't give me the clean feeling as a reg cleanser does
i've own so many cleansers
this cleanser did nothing for me
i do not ever use facial cleanser it to remove eye m/u except cleansing oil
i tried this oil because an esthetician suggested i try it
i picked this up as a 100-point reward because i love another drugstore lotion that contains ceramides
fragrances in general are one of the most irritating ingredients to include in skincare
if skincare was formulated properly
still searching for the holy grail of moisturizers
when i read the ingredients
one of the worst anti aging creams i have ever used
this was too intense as a cleanser
it doesn't cleanse very well.
i am convinced it is this cleanser.
i find this cleanser incredibly drying
this is a nice cleanser
i specifically wanted a cleanser that would work well with my clarisonic brush
this cleanser has an almost toothpaste-like thickness
i tried a sample of this after using the ibuki purifying cleanser for a few weeks
i love the purifying cleanser because it makes my skin feel very soft
searching for a new cleanser for my dry
this cleanser left my skin dry and tide.
which is known for decades to have made whitening products for the asian market
i fell in love with the cleanser
when repurchasing my cleanser i figured i may as well buy the moisturizer also
it is not as oily or ointment like
ingredients of my skin care products since i have amedical background
it is not a good cleanser
cleanser was very drying.
honestly i have never had a more drying cleanser
much less an oil cleanser
really wanted an antioxidant packed non-foaming cleanser
this cleanser is not as drying as fresh soy face
does not leave a firm on my skin like boscia purifying cleansing gel
i prefer the calming oil cleanser instead.
this cleanser definitely made my face cleaner
i love the lather of the product
this cleansing oil-gel for me seems more like a gel than an oil
i wanted to change up my cleansing routine!
mineral makeup--i have been a longtime fan of oil-based cleansers
will stick with the purifying one
want my cleanser to be one-step
it was not as good as the cleanser lotion i always use
smells like a cheap cheap plastic cleanser
i dont feel the "baby-soft" they claim after i use this cleansing oil gel
switched back to my old oil cleanser
i decided to repurchase the boscia cleanser right away
the cleanser does what it claims
i like how gentle this cleanser is.
its best for morning cleansing rather than taking of makeup type cleansing
i think this does a great job as a gentle cleanser
far closer to a gel than an oil cleanser
my skin reacted with the cleanser
compared to other cleansers i've used
maybe 10 years ago i got a very big tub of a japanese facial cleanser that had the same consistency
this cleanser seemed promising from the description
the facial cleanser i use for my acne is very stripping
revitalizing supreme face cream
bought this as a part of the skincare line up.
the wonderful soothing clinique laser repair
unlike other eye creams i've tried that show an almost instant difference in hydration
i've heard fab's regular face cleanser is better for sensitive skin
i ended up just washing my face as if this were the cleanser
bought another bottle of the cleanser
the preservative that they use to replace it with is phenoxyethanol which is supposedly worse than parabens
returned all 1st aid beauty products that have phenoxyethanol in them
unnecessary extras in something made to "detox" my pores
this is a good cleanser .
i loved "first aid beauty face cleanser"
this cleanser works great for preventing my acne
overall satisfied with the cleanser
i'd choose a clay mask in the same price range over this cleanser
this is a fine cleanser.
i usually use products with 2% benzoyl peroxide.
also the soap doesnt really lather
i used this product to cleanse my skin
didn't really enjoy this cleanser.
religiously use the original cleanser in the winter time
i used this cleanser with my clarisonic
that's to be expected with gels
this cleanser is great in the am
which is strange because this cleanser is advertised as a "deep clean"
i like the concept of this cleanser
have heard good things about two of the other fab cleansers
my face was clear prior to using this cleanser.
after using this cleanser
i think i just don't like gel cleaners
i like either a gentle oil cleaners or foaming cleaners
like i do with my other favorite cleansers
unlike many other creams i tried
i've tried a variety of eye creams.
also use the face cream
i've used $15 drug store eye creams that were more effective
i just want preventative aging ingredients
they also recommend applying argan oil after using the argan milk
other facial oils instead of this product
i enjoy using the josie maran argan oil as my night facial oil every once
this has to be the worst cleansing water i have tried
i absolutely love cleansing waters
the cleansing water has a soft
clean if used as a toner
i follow up with a cleanser
as a long time user of cleansing oils
reasonably priced compared to some other cleansing oils
the cleanser is well priced
with no other changes in my skincare or diet
i am relatively sure it was this cleanser
skin shouldn't purge with oil cleansing
this is a phenomenal cleansing oil.
pretty effective as a remover
very average make up remover
there are cleansing oils
after washing my face completely with this i went in with a cotton swab
i decided to give this a try since it's cheaper than the dior cleansing creme
i love their cosmetics
one of the first ingredients is dimethicone
i don't like putting perfumes on my face.
requires the right cleanser before h
i've used other serums before
just to use it to apply other eye creams with the metal piece
i much prefer the detox eye roller.
the applicator is great
thought the whitening might help
i really like ole hendricks red tea cleanser
you can get better quality packaging from cheap drugstore skincare products
this cleanser is very thick
i did not enjoy this cleanser.
not really a huge fan of this face cleanser.
i prefer the milk cleanser.
to me the milk cleanser is just so soothing
i remove pretty well all my cleansers with a hot cloth
the cleanser was not that great
the cleanser feels nice
it did not thoroughly cleanse my skin
i would spend the extra money to purchase the ren cleansing balm instead
// one last word about the rose gel mask.
kept lathering it on
also bought cleanser and felt the same.
this cleanser is the most abrasive cleanser i've ever used
i switched to a gentle cleanser
sensitivity is not an issue go for this cleanser
it may be a great cleanser for you
on the plus is the feel of the cleanser
this is probably a cleanser i would use once a week
feel like glycolic acid in my cleanser is overkill for my skin
i do use glycolic acid products to help keep my skin smooth
i decided to try this because i wanted a cleanser that had glycolic acid
it felt like i was washing my face with dish soap
maybe the concentration of glycolic acid is greater that in my previous cleanser
i don't know if its because of the fragrance or heavy chemicals
my esthetician actually recommended this for me
i just don't know about this cleanser.
glycolic acid is tried
if it weren't for the fact that i like to have a glycolic acid cleanser in my arsenal
you can get other glycolic acid cleansers for a better price
i love the lather
the glycolic acid was just too harsh for me.
i wanted to like this cleanser
i love the ptr anti-aging face cleanser
i feel like i get more out of the anti-aging cleanser
wanted to try this cleanser out
this cleaning gel was not for me.
not to mention all the parabens!!!
recently purchased this because i thought i would like a light rose scent in my cleanser
this cleanser does clean your skin well
i wouldn't recommend for a daily cleanser for dry skin
feels like putting toothpaste on your face
it was like rubbing minty toothpaste on my face.
will continue to use other products from the range such as the rosewater spray which is wonderful
use the moisturizers/masks
can try the detox oil from caudalie
even facial lotions can achieve this
it is kind of likely a gels.
fragranced products just should never be used on ones face
swear by the soy cleanser
i don't normally have sensitivities to anything skincare related
this is the first gel i've used
for now i'll stick to my beauty oils
drugstore blackhead remover patches that are 100xs more effective
was so disappointed to see the creams packaged together
almost acting as a hydrator
i hardly get allergy from skincare products
please amorepacific--separate these creams
was expecting it to turn into an oil cleanser
not one like other cleansing oils that i've used previously
i didn't notice any exfoliating properties either
irritating, causes "purging", too much fragrance
applied glamglow powermud dualcleanse treatment after cleansing my face
it worked fine as an exfoliator.
i also suggest following with a gel or cream cleanser afterwards
maybe i am sensitive to one of the ingredients
i am a big fan of their exfoliating cleanser
i will definitely continue to use their exfoliating cleanser
not this face wash or the toner
this cleanser left me disappointed
this cleanser just makes it worse
this cleanser is foamy
this cleanser really dries out my combination skin tone
replenishing cleanser at the recommendation of a sephora staff member
this cleanser is incredibly drying
went back to get a dior gentle cleansing milk suggested by an employee
the skincare expert at my local store highly recommended this cleanser
this cleanser made my face dry as toast
i really wanted to like this cleanser.
this cleanser left me red
i need a good cleanser to wash off my daily sunblock
the cleanser was very foamy
i really enjoyed this cleanser at first.
i applied the cream after washing my face
started incorporating it into my regular skincare routine 2x/day
as a silicone-based primer with some bonus skin care ingredients it is great
i've used cleansing oils from many other br
you also get to massage your face as you use an oil cleanser
this this cleansing oil was not the best i've used
i like most of bobbi's skincare line
there are better cleansing oils out there.
this was my first venture into cleansing oils
i've purchased her cleansing oil in the past
there aren't lots of beneficial ingredients or anything lasting about this cleanser
or lots of other cleansing oils
have been purchasing natural paraben-free creams for a few years now to brighten my skin
i trusted that this cream would be just as soothing
i put all of my skincare products on after
perhaps it was using it in combination with other cleansers
normal to drythe cleanser is a yellow color
lather my face in jojoba oil
took 3 washings to get rid of the film
tried to use this as part of my morning skincare routine
makes zero difference in your skincare routine
i constantly use skincare products
only complaint i have is the smell as i prefer my serums to be odourless
with the onslaught of serums
i buy a jar of the bio-performance revitalizing cream
this lotion has a ton of ingredients.
better cleansers for a better price
i got sample of ultimate anti-aging melting cleanser
this cleanser left my skin very greasy.
i feel greasy after cleansing
i shouldn't feel like i need a cleanser after a cleanser
it works well when i rinse using a soft washcloth
it's definitely not the best oil cleanser i've used
feels like i need to use mother cleanser to remove all the oily mess
this cleanser doesn't do it for me
i often find myself re-washing my face with a second cleanser
i got this cleanser as part of the anti-aging kit
i really like oil cleansers
when i found this cleanser
it doesn't rinse well
leaves a greasy film all over your face which means that this oil-gel cleanser is for a double-cleanse only
this was after a thorough rinsing
it is a great cleanser
i don't recommend for oily skin
it leaves a wax like feel on my skin that i need to use another cleanser to wash off
the types of cleansers i use
the oil doesn't seem to come off my skin like most oil cleansers
if you're in the market for an oil cleanser tatcha is a great one
i think it's the oils used in this cleanser.
this was the worst cleanser i have ever used
even after cleansing twice
the whole gel to oil was fine
so disappointed by this cleanser.
i always go over my face twice with the cleanser
the cleanser did breakdown into a milk
my take is that this cleanser would be best for a two-step regimen
i regularly use algenist's gentle rejuvenating cleanser with more satisfying results
mascara residue on my face cloth after using this cleanser
this was the most ineffective cleanser i've ever used
i tried this cleanser for a few weeks.
i did not like rubbing the cleanser on my dry skin first
had to follow up with a better cleanser
while i find this cleanser unique in its melting texture
i also tried algenist rejuvenating cleanser 1 week later
i found that cleanser to be gentler on my skin
cleansing oil i've tried before
it doesn't rinse clean
i will purchase another gel to oil cleanser because i think they are great
along with the creams
the description on my sample called it a lotion
i used it as a pre cleanser to remove my makeup before using my main cleanser to tackle my skin issues
this cleanser is very difficult to wash off
i really liked this cleanser
i'd rewash my face with a regular cleanser to get of the oily residue
this gel-oil cleanser does not remove my minimal make up
this used to be my favorite melting cleanser
there are a lot of oil cleansers that are available in pump bottles sold by almost every skin care line now
annoying for a face cleanser
not the best cleaner
this is a pretty good cleanser
so much so that i used my normal cleanser after
when i wipe my face with my toner
l used my usual makeup remover
then use a regular cleanser to wash your face?
should not be marketed as a cleanser
cleanse this would be perfect for you
will try one of their other cleansers.
it could never be a daily cleanser for me
followed it with a soy based cleanser
after using the cleansing gelee
this cleanser went on smooth
i don't like this feeling at all of the cleanser on my face
it felt super greasy and i love cleansing oils.
i usually love oil cleansers
while this cleanser took off most of my makeup
i've tried probably a dozen cleansing balms/oils
love the idea of this cleanser being a jelly
this melting cleanser was a little messy to use
the cleanser left an oily residue
had to follow up with some toner to remove the film
have to wash my face twice with my daily cleanser
oily residue on my skin that took a scrubbing with my usual cleanser
my twice-a-week exfoliating product to get rid of
i never use mineral oil on my skin
i liked this cleansing oil when i first used it
which is fine because mineral oil is a great hypoallergenic oil to cleanse with
as someone who chooses almost all my skincare products
especially the leave on products like lotions
this is a good refreshing cleanser
while this claims to be a gentle cleanser
it's not as good as the anti-aging gel.
so unless a cleanser is designed for oily or acne prone skin
when i don't need to exfoliant i use this.
it's a good skin cleanser for sensitive skin
this foaming cleanser seems fine
why cosmetic companies dispense beauty products for your skin in an open jar
i applied it with the licorice serum every morning after toner
serums to cover all of my facial skincare bases
the hyaluronic acid is listed as an ingredient after the preservative
i prefer unscented skincare products.
as if i've just applied toner
received a sample of shaping facial lift lipo drain serum
topped-off with my favorite anti-wrinkle creams
kind of like a bathroom cleaning fluid
act as my "second cleanse
not so great toner.
want to try a couple other micellar/cleanser waters before i buy again
their soy face cleanser i love it
using this in conjunction to a real cleanser
i absolutely had to rinse when using this
which defeats the purpose of a cleansing water for me
however for something that promises to cleanse
there are much more effective cleansers
for some reason my skin only does this with gels
with fresh soy cleanser
i am convinced after trying many serums
creams over the years
so it works great when used with botox!
incorporated into my skincare routine
this cream does not replace or work as well as botox
as a wrinkle relaxer it failed
i buy a lot of skincare products
it's an ok cleanser.
i just use cleansers to keep my face blemish free
the actual cleanser product itself worked really well
i used this cleanser twice before my skin completely reacted to this product
worst cleanser i have ever used.
i remove my makeup before using this cleanser
my skin does not feel very cleansed after as compared to other cleansers i have used
the cleanser is actually pretty good.
this cleanser though i cold not st
save your money on this cleanser
to go with a milder cleanser
just like a bunch of other facial cleansers
it has absolutely no exfoliation whatsoever.
this is the worst oil cleanser i have ever used
tried this cleanser multiple times
you will need to use another cleanser
a scrub to remove the mess this cleanser makes
using this cleanser on clean skin may work for that
another cleanser to get it all off
i used it as a makeup remover
which i then had to scrub off with a towel or another cleanser
after mixing with water to rinse
purchased this thinking i would love the gentle cleanser as well
fragrance is just unnecessary in skin care products
i found this cleanser a bit too drying for my skin
this cleanser does not irritate my skin
this cleanser has a great texture
think pretty much any oil-based cleanser should be removed with a wet washcloth
i don't think this cleanser actually cleanses very well
this cleanser isn't my favorite out of all of tata harper's cleaners
it wasn't that great as a cleanser
for a 19 year-old using a sample to moisturize her eye area at night
it's nice to not have the parabens
now if philosophy would only eliminate the parabens from the cleanser
why do these companies insist on perfuming their creams???
there are better cleansing oils.
are the tatcha cleansers failing to clean my skin?
tonight i will test with my clinique exfoliating scrub followed by the tatcha toner
i tried this initially as my nightly cleanser
i started using this as a morning cleanser
i've used several cleansing oils
feels like a normal cleansing oil.
i don't think a cleansing oil is necessary in a skincare routine
i didn't want to have to return a $12 bottle of the smallest amount of cleanser
using an oil cleanser always takes time to get use to
it's not even close to being as good as josie maran argan oil cleanser
i've used other cleansing oils without the same issue
it's a really basic oil cleanser.
i've used tons of other oils before to remove my makeup
it had a sample of their luxury facial oil
made to include gentle exfoliation in the morning with grinder oatmeal
as does a lot of different skincare
it was no different than any other moisturizers or oils i've used in the past
i've tried a few face oils
it contains the detergent like chemical sulfate
they try to make up for it by adding other moisturizing ingredients like marula oil
i find the facial cleansing bars to be very drying
come out with a liquid cleanser
you might as well wash your face with a drugstore br
this is not soap
soap is awful for your face.
it's merely a cleanser in solid, bar form!
i really liked this facial soap at first.
very expensive for soap.
i find the facial cleansing bars to be very drying
juju either in the morning or night for a weekly exfoliation
i like it is made of natural ingredients
the cleanse was nice
i needed to add a glycolic wash back into my weekly skin care regime to help slough off the dead skin with a stronger exfoliation
wouldn't use oils there
i applied it right after my toner.
so far i do like the toner and exfoliator.
(i've used the elixir once a day only.)
not a fan of this cleanser
i like the ingredients
it's an average cleanser
does a decent job of cleansing the skin
found the cleanser to be very drying.
this cleanser just made my skin extra dry
i used this cleanser it tried my face very horribly
this is a gentle cleanser that takes off most of my makeup
this cleanser does not have any exfoliating benefits
i recommend this cleanser especially for dry skin
i really did not like this cleanser.
are for toning more than final step cleansing like western toners
i also wished it was a creamy cleanser.
it doesn't cleanse the skin
you'd be better off to buy a cleanser
same with the toning.
i would keep using the milk cleanser if they still had it
as a cleanser that falls into the "precleanse" category
not foaming or purifying
after rinsing off the cleanser
i felt the need to use a different cleanser to get rid of that greasy film
then again so does all cleansing oils
will just stick to my boscia green cleansing oil.
that was my first time finishing the entire container of a cleanser
i feel like this emulsion does not do as good of a job of removing makeup as the cleanser does
this was the first milk cleanser i tried before also trying the clarins version
i don't like the ingredients.
which is a waste of gel-an expensive gel
it doesn't cleanse as much as i want it to cleanse
not via scrubbing or exfoliating ingredients.
but drying, overly strong cleansing ingredients.
this cleanser is very greasy.
i received a free sample of this foaming sonic facial soap
although it is unscented
when i rinse this soap off
used this with my clarisonic cleansing brush
this facial soap dried my skin
this cleanser was drying
otherwise this cleanser is a no go
useless step to my skincare routine
i don't like the silicones in it.
the silicone made it much more of a primer
i wish it were a skin softening plumping formula.
cleanliness that always follows the washing off of a mask
is paraben free which is another negative
i find rinsing without the use of a wash cloth is better for me
i've used a lot of different cleansers
this cleanser dried out my skin instantly the first use
i used it to wash my beauty blender now .
this must be one of the worst skincare products i have ever tried
so this is the 3rd time i have tried to use this cleanser
at first i really loved this cleanser
this cleanser made the area around my mouth extremely dry
i may add that i use a moisturizer after cleansing my face in the morning
some of my other anti-aging face washes feel more like lotions
am rarely sensitive to different cleansers
my $3 soap give a same result..
stuck to oil cleansing method
immediately after i wash my face with this i have to moisturize
i'll probably try out other cleansers.
this cleanser is very gentle
this is a good cleanser for those without acne
like putting detergent on your skin.
this feels very similar to an orange drugstore cleanser
i do, however, like this cleanser.
would not buy--with all the parabens
after just a couple days of use my skin became so dry that lotions stung
decided to try the cleansing gel
going on week 2 of using the cleanser
s together to create a foaming lather" well this product never foams
this cleanser does do the job
their white bottled cleanser
i switched back to my old cleanser
use the cleanser with this brush
it is a bit more difficult to rinse off this cleanser as the little beads or grainy things in the cleanser are sometimes hard to wash off
this cleanser would have been phenomenal without the perfume
this cleanser version did nothing for me
i liked the feel of this cleanser
i'll be continuing to use my drugstore cleanser for sensitive skin
this is a good cleanser
this cleanser did not work for me
this cleanser is for someone with super oily skin
i will stick to my normal cleanser
that was after i exfoliated with the org mineral peel exfoliator three times
wanted to try the matching cleanser
a cleanser should never have an unauthentic scent
this cleanser is drying
switched back to my old cleanser
was hoping this cleanser would do the trick
best smelling cleanser i have ever used.
i liked the idea of a mud to foam cleanser
it will look like i have almost toothpaste on my face
i've tried other eye creams
not to mention that this cream is chock full of chemicals
also that many creams burn my face
soy cleanser which i love
there are other oil cleansers that do a better job
not recommend to oil skin!!
this is not the right cleanser.
after i clean my face i use toner or astringent
you must follow-up with a regular cleansing foam
following with an exfoliant might help
i've used several oil cleansers before
i wanted to find a good cleansing oil
i got this cleanser in the plasma essentials kit.
the cleanser does not have a bad scent
i think i'll stick with the perricone nutrive cleanser
personally i hate sunblocks.
several of the no makeup skincare products
i believe the ingredient chlorella protothecoides is causing the issue as it's not found in the moisturizer
i feel like i'm slathering chemicals on my face.
although it cleanses well
- like a combination of nail polish remover
it may be the perfect cleanser for some
but still a great mask and face cleanser.
i like how my skin feels after i use the cleanser
you can use it as a mask or cleanser
rinse if it had been phenomenal
just are craving for your cleanser/mask to change color while you use it
i highly disapprove this cleanser :
i think it is more of just a chemical reaction of the ingredients
pills up under makeup
this "gel" was one of the most awkward skincare products i have ever used
bought it for brightening effect as a skincare product
cleanser i have ever used
i combine it with another cleanser as i don't think the cleansing is great
this doesn't work as a regular cleanser for me
i love nice flowerly cleansers
i exfoliate regularly with clinique 7 day scrub
the ingredients are horrible for your skin
i used it with my normal skincare routine
as with most skincare
have to be very careful with serums/lotions because they have this ingredient
it's one of the ingredients
hate perfume in skincare
using an exfoliating scrub to try to normalize my skin
this is like rubbing perfume on your face!
it doesn't refine my pores or make cosmetics go on better
this new formula does not moisturize my skin as well as the old formulation did
one of theeee worst under eye balms i've ever tried
their makeup cleansing lotion-i'm not impressed with their products
i never break out from new skincare
it ends with synthetic dyes
i tried mixing it with different moisturizers
maybe this would work if you combined it with other soothing serums
if i use the recommended amount of about a 1/4 teaspoon
again if using the recommended 1/4 teaspoon amount the 1 oz container will only last me for 23 days
it almost feels like pure silicone or glycerin
i really like that it is formulated without parabens
$8 drugstore primer than this
if you are using liquid sunscreen under makeups everyday
i enjoyed this cleanser at first
even to my combination to oily skin this cleanser is super drying
if i don't use a mask or forget to exfoliate
i picked up a sample of this "hydrating" cleanser in hopes of restoring moisture into my skin
while this cleanser left my face squeaky clean
when i switch back to my lower ph cleanser my acne clears up
finally tested the ph level on this cleanser
i wanted a toner water
after my serums/before makeup
jurlique's cleansing oil didn't remove my mascara
yet a couple cleansing oils i've tried left my skin feeling clean
it def does moisturize compared to most cleansers
then use my summer gel cleanser
i'd consider this a cleanser if you want to pre-cleanse first?
i've used a bunch of eye creams
redeemed this 100-point perk at sephora to test out other eye creams
(several additives are suspected carcinogens.
bought this because i was in need of a cleanser
honestly this is the worst cleanser i have ever used
the cleanser may be great
purchased this on my quest to find a good am/pm face cleanser to clean my pores of the dirt
i really loved this cleanser.
this cleanser did nothing
as i love a clay cleanser
with the addition of the gel cleanser it gave a really great cleanse when i'm feeling congested
the oil part of the cleanser is a terrific cleansing oil that leaves your skin feeling completely clean
this cleanser didn't help with my breakouts
i think it is overpriced for a cleanser
this cleanser cleans very well
cause i had high hopes for this cleanser
this did a great job at cleansing my skin.
i think it would be a great morning cleanser
i'll stick to my cleansing oils
i found that this cleanser didn't foam up nearly as much as the thirstycleanse version
i really regret spending $39 on this cleanser.
i've tried using just the gel
i love all the regular products in cling the green just not as this dual bottle cleanser
one of the worst cleansers ever
i wanted to love this "cleanser"
spray water primer works ok but not great.
although i'd prefer it to be unscented
i applied this to clean skin
i exchanged it for the first aid beauty 5 in 1 face cream spf 30
tried to use a combination of different moisturizers
i really liked the fab cleanser
break out with chemical sunscreens
y as a a quick cleanser
i usually use the purifying
this cleanser claims to warm up upon skin contact
spreading this cleanser was difficult
pass on this, love sephora's cleansing oil.
not with this cleanser.
it's not my favorite cleanser
who uses two cleaners
i liked this cleanser and will buy it again.
this cleanser is okay.
i found that odd since i regularly exfoliate
followed the tip in another review stating to spritz some caudalie grape water on face before rinsing off the mask
after rinsing i spritzed my face again with the grape water
don't even know why is this a purifying mask
dose not take well to certain oils like coconut oil for example
find in other oils
t is highly scented which made it feel like i was applying chemicals to my face
it wasn't very effective as a first step cleanser
three other cleansing balms last week
i love balm cleansers.
i like oil cleansers second only to balm ones
if they made a moisturizer or foamy cleanser with this scent i would buy it in a heartbeat
second cleanser to actually remove the oil
this cleanser really brings the oils out on my t zone
this was a so-so cleanser.
this product was a decent cleanser
this cleanser just worst one i have ever used.
i don't love this cleansing balm
then into a cleansing milk when it comes in contact with water
it is neat how it changes from solid to oil to a cleanser texture that washes off
because an esthetician told me she uses oil to remove her make-up before cleansing
ole henriksen solid cleansing oils
who is just cleansing their face
i used other eye creams by dermadoctor
this cleanser is -fine-
the cleanser itself does a great job
so the cleanser will r
i definitely prefer the charcoal wash in the pump bottle for convenience
this cleanser felt fantastic
i switched to the pump cleanser.
as a cleanser it works
'll be switching back to a more gentle cleanser
since the cleanser is black
the cleanser itself wasn't something extra ordinary
i like the regular boscia cleanser much better.
i read the reviews about how soft this "stick" cleanser was
this is a twist- up cleanser with the consistency softer than that of a glycerin soap
no major hydration ingredients
the texture was that of hand sanitizer.
taking out all other serums
would keep it as an oil for massage
i've used face oils for 30 years
because it contains some ingredients which irritate skin
advanced skincare is expensive
am used to great skincare as a vib rouge
for now i don't need a nearly $70 facial exfoliating mask
i rather just use whitening mask than spending $80 on this
framboos along with a charcoal daily cleanser
whenever i get glycolic acid treatments from my derma
only used 2 pumps of lotion in the morning
then use my clarisonic brush to exfoliate
i will stick to my nighttime face oils.
after trying various cleansing oils
using an oil cleanser with a better oil as a base
this cleanser was very frustrating to use.
toner or a cleansing wipe
i would look like a raccoon after using this cleanser
i would not recommend this cleanser
i love cleansing oils for makeup removal
i love cleansing oils
this is the first time i've purchased a cleansing oil
i find it nice as a facial massage
rinse easy breezy cleanser
this cleanser wasn't the best choice for me.
i've tried sample oil cleansers from other br
this was the first cleansing oil i ever tried
i still needed to follow up with another cleanser
sanitizer for your face
i am a professional esthetician who researches many products
the amount of actives in this formula are less than 1% making this masque ineffective for any amount if correction or healing
unless you use any sort of exfoliating product beforeh
will try the chamomile one soon:)
this was the only new product i was using in my skincare routine
the first ingredient is a silicone
however i used mine in my nightly skincare routine
love the ptr cucumber foaming cleanser
opinions of anti-aging moisturizers
i like the philosophy skincare line
i got the product based sephora beauty advisor recommended if i want my skin treat combination of hydration
perhaps it is the glycolic acid or maybe the sake
i tried this in conjunction with a facial oil
the gel has a strong alcohol smell that reminds me of nailpolish remover
i find this balm to be irritating
compared to other light moisturizers i have used
the cleansing gel was ok, nothing special.
ole henriksen is my favorite skincare brand.
i felt that they just made a gel compound out of cucumber
i've used other eye creams that felt the same
non-greasy feel to the cream
basically this product is a cocktail of comedogenic chemicals
would definitely consider it more of a cleanser than a treatment
it's an alright cleanser
i dislike using creamy cleansers
i don't hate this cleanser
i applied various algenist moisturizers after the serum
unlike other serums from algenist
when i filtered moisturizers to meet my skin
can be used after another cleanser
try to work the cleanser into the skin
2 stars because it's unscented
this masque gave my skin irritation.
i don't use it daily as i have other serums
different skincare needs on different days
not all the ingredients are vegan as i would like
i used this in conjunction with the evercalm lotion
i am all about less being more with my skincare routine
i couldn't get this cleanser to foam at all
i dispise this cleanser.
i also used the scrub
s into my skincare though
this cleanser is nothing special.
the day cleanser is phenomenal
i am so happy with the daily cleanser
by the night cleanser
this cleanser did clean the face okay
i would also prefer a cleanser that foams up a lot more
use your regular cleanser and save your money.
i received this cleanser with my foreo
been trying to find the perfect cleanser to go with the device
still need to use cleanser afterwards
having tried many other 'clean' moisturizers
i always grab moisturizer samples in those tiny little jars
so these small jars are perfect for storing with my lipsticks
i would thoroughly rinse your face
it cleanses very well
i ended up using it as a body soap
the activated charcoal soap for my teenager
based on the claims that this is a gentle soap
will use it up as a body soap
as far as their activated charcoal soap
made natural soap with activated charcoal ingredient at the top of the list
this soap works well to really clean your skin
my skin seems to do far better with argan or jojoba oils
sensitive skin that i've discovered prefers facial oils over many other moisturizers
still not 100% sold on this brands skin oils.
i will say that i use a gentle bha liquid exfoliant daily in my nighttime skincare routine so maybe that's why i didn't notice any results
actually the bar soap made my skin worse
thought i might like the "cleaner" ingredients
even tried using a variety of face creams
wanted to renew it with the glycolic
this was the only product change in my skincare.
i wish it is unscented like the others...
the other serums/face oils/moisturizers i have been using for the past few months have been kind to my skin
almost like a cleansing oil
i applied it after washing my skin
replacing my other moisturizers with this one alone
it's just not my all-time favorite 2nd-step cleanser after oil cleansing
i love foamy cleanser.
followed it with my toner
i let my kid use it as shaving cream with his fake shaver set
i like to use this foaming cleanser during summer when my skin is more oily
it really is like washing your face with shaving cream
i think this cleanser is a novelty- cool packaging
i think it's better to try out the other cleansers available at sephora
this facial cleanser is the worst cleanser i have ever used
my skin still feels dirty after using this cleanser
it's face soap with the same chemicals used in drug store cleansers
i would relate the cleansing experience of this product to having just washed your face with a bar of soap
this face cleanser does a fine job.
when using it i found myself missing my classic face cleansers
i've never used a mousse cleanser
the cleanser does feel soft on the skin
after washing my face with this
my skin would feel unclean still because of all the fragrances in it
this cleanser helped keep my skin soft
it is a nice cleanser
which defeats the whole purpose of a foam soap
it does it's job of cleaning gently with it's foaming properties
it is a gentle morning cleanse
it does a fine job of cleansing
this cleanser is mediocre at best.
unnecessary -- i try to stay away from fragrance in my skincare
i wish they made an unscented version.
most glycolic acid products i buy show results right away
perhaps the other ingredients/chemicals in this serum do more damage than the hydroquinone by itself
i used this cleanser while i was in vacation
bhas are only effective as chemical exfoliants when they are left on the skin
since this is just a cleanser
the jojoba beads were nice for scrubbing
i originally bought this product because i needed a good daily cleanser
i would prefer a cleanser without sls
it''s an ok cleanser that doesn't dry your skin out
i came along this cleanser through the skin care i
i felt as all my impurities weren't being removed even with the addition of a exfoliating brush
decided to add this cleansing oil to the mix for double cleansing
to also wash my face with in between yoga
this double mousse cleanser actually left my skin red
i used it with the perfecting lotion
this cleanser worked for me immediately.
this cleanser works so well i'm fine with it
i would not use it as a daily cleanser
made them shed from the intensity of this cleanser
i returned this cleanser because it was way too drying
maybe i will try the time release acne cleanser eventually
really wanted a cleanser that would combat breakouts
i started off with the other cleanser
it's an okay cleanser.
this cleanser didn't help with my breakouts at all
this cleanser is no
i switched to the murad renewing cleansing cream
the menthol in this soap irritated my skin
this cleanser didn't help my acne at all
this cleanser was not helpful in treating my acne
felt like i was just using a regular cleanser
this cleanser was huge compared to all other cleansers i've purchased from sephora
no, it is not skin purging.
thought this cleanser would clear my skin
overall this cleanser is decent.
i got to try this cleanser in 3-step set.
the hunt for an effective anti-acne cleanser goes on :
this cleanser stripped it to being very dry
it's called a topical wrinkle filler
this is one of the worst wrinkle "fillers" i've yet to try
one of the worst hyaluronic acid products
this cleanser balm does have an unexpected rough texture
in the cleanser form
i see the "sugar-based cleanser" part
i already have the ceramic slip clay cleanser
i just don't see the point of this cleanser
did not cleanse skin completely
i still have remnants of makeup after rinsing.
this cleanser is more of a gentle scrub.
too pricey to use as an everyday cleansing balm
the scrub melts into the balm as you massage it
ratio of scrub to balm seems off
as i'd expect with any cleanser
smell of this cleansing balm
cleansing grains are hard to rinse out
usually prior to washing my hair
exfoliating mask after taking my makeup off with another product
use my deep cleansing oil
when i used toner after using only this
it's pretty much like other oil-based cleansing balms
i love cleansing balms to remove my makeup.
i personally didn't like using this as a cleansing balm
which i like better than using it as a cleansing balm
i've used much cheaper cleansing balms for a fraction of the cost
do i like cleansing balms???
i would then massage the cloth over my face
also had to rewash with another face cleanser bc it still felt too oily
so not a one step cleanser
kick start treating my skin at the cleansing stage
definitely need to double cleanse
i looked up the ingredients
read reviews of this cleansing
bought the cleansing butter.
i needed a cleanser for dry skin that also brightens
this cleanser is very good for make up removal
wash again with a regular cleanser afterwards
had to get another separate cleanser.
tery cream that you massage into your skin then rub off with a sponge
one of the worst oils i have tried
unlike the thermal cleansing balm
the thermal cleansing balm uses just a dab
try the foaming omorovicza cleanser
