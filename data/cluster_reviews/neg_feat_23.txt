then pores and blackheads were coming out.
didn't help on my rosacea either
i don't notice a reduction in redness
angry acne scars on my face have faded to a light brown
it made my skin oily and caused a few breakouts.
i didn't feel or see relief from redness.
i did give it two stars because it does soothe redness
-sensitive-no history of acne-dry climate
the product was causing flareups
it doesn't help with pores or blackheads.
blackheads were still there
it looks like a very bad sunburn.
prone to acne skin that can get very red
it did not soothe dry patches of skin on my face nor did it calm redness on my cheeks like i was told it would
i don't think that it helped much with puffiness
it seemed to not agree with my acne
it didn't cause any extra breakouts
i can get red around my cheeks sort of a minor dermatitis you could say
didn't help my redness or sensitive skin
i woke up with 2 zits.
have very sensitive skin/contact dermatitis
the small annoying pimples it gives me is frustrating
i found it produced an itchy
it seems to cause little breakouts
the pimples were gone
a few days after using i noticed little pimples on my face like my pores were really enlarged with excess sebum
then the headaches started
pustule pimples right under eyelids
this is one of the many eye creams that i have tried
removed those puffiness or dark circles from lack of sleep
doesn't cause acne problems
i don't have puffiness under my eyes
a salesperson told me this would be perfect to reduce puffiness under my eyes
i actually have patches of flaking skin now.
i rarely see breakouts
it left some discoloration even with putting on half the dose
saw some redness forming underneath
at home was the tingling sensation
i don't have acne-prone skin
this product gave me pimples where it was applied
it causes make up to pill badly
it actually accentuated these wrinkles
found an article that said a dermatologist can look at your face
i don't have sagging skin or jowls.
got pimples where i used it
lessening of wrinkles or anything
not for aging skin.
haven't had any peeling skin or flakiness that i typically get with retinol products
i get some breakouts on my chin area
acne chin is still a thing
many better retinol/retinoids products out there.
this exfoliator has made mi skin goes red with pimples
if your skin is prone to acne stay away from this
not really if your main concern is acne
i usually only have occasional pms breakouts
chin or minor breakouts
dry patches, flaking, redness and acne!!
dryness around my mouth
didn't help clear my acne prone skin at all
i did not sleep with eye patches.
didn't irritate my skin
it helped with acne, it helped with redness.
i even used acne medication
this dried my skin out and caused breakouts.
she has never had acne
my redness is gone for a little bit
caused microcuts on my skin
i seen a difference in my acne scars after one use
create pimples at first
still occasionally got breakouts
my blackheads were darker
acne scars the mask hasn't done anything to stop acne
also had no pimples or irritated areas on my face
a skin care expert at sephora referred this product to me stating that it will minimize my blackheads
caused my foundation to pill
it gave me acne
if used everyday it caused irritation.
the breakouts stopped as well
the blackheads on my nose look much worse
the pimples are literally in lines from my brow-bone to around my mouth on both of my cheeks
deep condition your hair
doesn't seem to actually help with puffiness
not a skin care product
my face became itchy
kind of made my skin itch
not just little pimples
like other reviewers i found this product caused breakouts
acne on my forehead
wrinkles scare me more
it didn't seem that effective in helping prevent acne or lessen it
not good for acne
more blemishes had appeared
this lotion was causing my breakouts.
did not "perfect" my skin which is acne prone
it didn't seem to help with redness or blemishes either
my acne is mild to moderate depending on my stress levels
the redness didn't completely subside for 5 days
did nothing for my acne.
to go out for a facial
it won't harm the skin
really only flares up a couple times a month with a few pimples
didn't really help with my breakouts
i rarely get pimples
made the blackheads on my nose worse
my mild acne cleared up from it
in the process clear up acne
i am still prone to hormonal breakouts with the product
it has reduced the frequency of breakouts
before using this product i had no problem with acne
now it seems i'm battling one or two pimples every month
i also had breakouts from it
it made breakouts flare up
this didn't really help with my hormonal acne
this really isn't going to help much if you have hormonal acne
wrinkles" as it claims to do
after using this for a few days i noticed bigger blackheads
even some tiny whiteheads
acne-prone skincare routine could have
like i get a few zits around my period.
i think her hyperpigmentation managed to lighten up with the use of this oil
now i have to get rid of my old scars
this was a recommended solution for hormonal acne by the sephora staff
after a couple of uses my acne got worse
i never usually get irritated skin from creams
i always had no acne and clear skin.
dryness all over my cheeks
but it didn't reduce lines, wrinkles, or pores.
if i touch my under eye area it immediately causes puffiness
it just didn't help with puffiness or bags for me
because it is very moisturizing i have had two outbreaks
i never get pimples
they did not reduce puffiness
does nothing for puffiness.
no difference in puffiness or wrinkles
don't have any wrinkles
was hoping to reduce under eye puffiness
it did seem to help with my puffiness a bit
this product did nothing to improve under eye circles or puffiness
doesn't seem to be reducing puffiness or under eye circles
the few pimples i have on my cheek have not improved in appearance
or if you're trying to prevent pigmentation
it won't work for acne pigmentation or dark spots
woke up with multiple huge whiteheads
i don't recommend this to people with acne-prone skin
it also did not do anything for acne scarring or hyperpigmentation
this product didn't fade any of my acne scars.
i've had great results with retinol
glycolic acid for the fading of my acne scars
it did not help with the dullness my skin was experiencing
also sometimes acne prone
: i don't have acne prone skin i just suffer from dryness
i never ever get pimples.
also be careful if you have acne scars
at this moment it doesn't do me much with my redness from my acne scars
had never in my life suffered from acne
3 pimples at a time for me are lots.
white patches like i had a bunch of acne cream on
i would say this is not for sensitive or acne prone skin
little whiteheads on my cheeks
it caused a lot of redness even for my standards.
issues with redness i would stay clear of it
it did absolutely nothing for the redness on my cheeks or to even out my skin
who would pay for more wrinkles
woke up to about 10 small pimples
there irritants should be eliminated.
too much for my sensitive skin and headaches.
could cause a skin infection or really irritate sensitive skin
i gave me a migraine.
most importantly it gave me little pimples on my face in places i never usually get pimples
i wouldn't recommend for already wrinkled skin
i just have some puffiness
not too much for wrinkles
because i was wrinkling it up because i could not stop sneezing due to the smell
not full on pimples
it helped with my redness
it definitely helps with wrinkles
it almost looked like sunburn
i saw no brightening in my acne scars
it was slowly causing me to get stubborn acne
this product didn't make my occasional breakouts worse
as well as some mild rosacea
not always effective for those with seborrheic dermatitis
i would recommend skipping this cleanser if you suffer from any sort of dermatitis
sulfates are bad for the skin in general
even worse for sensitive skins that suffer from seborrheic dermatitis
i get patches of seborrheic dermatitis around my mouth every fall
it didn't seem to reduce puffiness or anything like that
which is also acne prone
lately it's been dehydrated from using retinol
doesn't fade or change any discoloration.
my complexion is worse in some ways than before with persistent acne along with clogged
i now have persistent acne
i don't have an acne prone skin
it caused more blockage for my breakouts
and lastly it caused me to have breakouts.
or if you even slightly acne prone
then it was constant dryness
it caused really bad breakouts
by the way, my skin is oily, i have acne bumps.
new giant pimples which usually doesn't happen
it didn't help my acne or wrinkles at all
did absolutely nothing for my wrinkles.
made my breakouts worse
why you would put pore clogging silicones in an acne treatment is beyond me
this does nothing for pores or skin discolorations
which irritates my rosacea
my skin could use a reapplication
the biggest problem is it gives me monster zits.
noticed the zits came back
woke up with 20 little pimples
have been searching for my hg eye cream for under eye dryness that tends to be extremely accentuated by under eye concealer
causes me to have redness
it does take the puffiness out of my eyes
do not notice a reduction in dark circles or puffiness
dark circles i get in the morning from allergies
maybe i can see a reduction in puffiness
i don't want to promote wrinkles
i still have puffiness
do like the tingling sensation
acne control are wonderful
add to that acne scarring
a few sunspots around my eyes
they were all acne treatments i was a little put off because my skin is clear
maybe for younger skin
this serum did not do anything for my dark spots or acne scars
it will further exacerbate the skin problems.
any cuts or zits on your face will sting like crazy
i never get breakouts
it helps a bit with redness
as it worked to reduce the redness
while it helps with dryness
by week two, i have 5 big pimples.
baby facial for months now
it didn't cause any reactions or breakouts which is great
gave me some breakouts
should not be advertized for oily/acne prone skin
i don't get pimples
love their acne clearing solution
i suspected it was causing some pimples
then the breakouts started
this product is fibromyalgia
the pimples outweigh the pleasant scent
even if it didn't cause breakouts
have maybe 5 pimples a year
i think if you have slight puffiness
i got terrible breakouts from using this.
it just didn't work for my acne filled skin
i ended up with small whiteheads on my nose:
when i'd use it before or after makeup for blurring or dryness
redness solutions cream at night
none of the blurring effects or skincare benefits that i was expecting
having young skin with some acne
when i stopped the pimples were still there
i can see this causing problems for people sensitive to fragrance
i already have acne prone/sensitive skin with some blemishes
then i started getting acne on my cheeks
woke up with three lovely new pimples
my combo, acne prone skin will thank me.
tried this as a sample as i have oily acne prone skin
i never get breakouts on my cheeks
never had issues with acne aside from an occasional small hormonal pimple
as the type of acne it caused was worse than any pimple i've dealt with
oily acne prone skin
had far more blackheads
it did sting a healing acne spot when applying.
my skin is extremely prone to breakouts
i noticed the puffiness under my eyes have decreased
it made some of my acne worse
i can see alot of developing pimples already.
i woke up to whiteheads on my cheeks
dry acne prone skin
not for my acne-prone skin type
i also never get acne on my cheeks
woke up to a new zit on my chin
i wish it helped with my acne
for some reason i get a light redness from the cream
which caused even more acne
this will also bring out any texture or acne on the skin
not acne prone skin
i did not have acne
do not use this if you have acne or are prone to getting acne
not only does it barely treat breakouts
the white sebum that comes out of our piercings
didn't take care of my under the skin acne
did nothing for my acne
i still have breakouts .
my problem is blackheads on my nose.
this was supposed to help me with my blackheads
cover my clear skin in acne
i noticed more breakouts ☹
it did nothing for my acne or scars.
i also get a lot of redness
i noticed more pimples all over my face.
after using this i had 3 huge pimples on my chin
i heard amazing things about this getting rid of pimples
now i have two pimples that are much worse than my regular pimple
my main reason of purchasing this product was to clear up my hormonal acne
possibly reduced acne scars
claim to get rid of acne
this didn't prevent or treat my acne as it claims to do
somewhat helped with acne spots
i got some in my hair
it just looks like i have brownish foundation on top of my rosacea red skin
blotchy right after using it
the redness subsided after an hour
acne-prone skin — so this may work for people who have few-to-no skin issues
this mask caused skin irritation
it minimized the redness of some acne on my face
i asked my dermatologist
i started to notice pimples
i never get pimples like that
i would see dark acne spots disappear within a few weeks
even deeper scars in my skin from acne
i don't see a significant difference on my acne scars after using this product for about a month
i wanted something for under eye wrinkles
i wouldn't count on this to diminish hyperpigmentation
has several dark marks from acne in the past
doesn't do anything for hyperpigmentation caused by rosacea
my acne has minimized a bit
on with acne since being a teen
it hasn't done anything to clear my acne up
it didn't help my breakouts at all or control my oiliness
i know everyone's acne is different.
it just made my acne feel agitated
the hyper pigmentation has lighten a bit
i could see one or two small acne spots trying to form
a lot of redness in my face which really just didn't agree with this mask
i used retinoids so that may be the reason this product stings really bad
a few acne bumps around my chin
i got tiny pimples all over
feels great on the skin and helped some acne.
used it and woke up with 3 new pimples!
even with good diet
sulfur products usually work wonders on my acne
or get rid of any of my pimples
have previously used the medicated pads
it did absolutely nothing for oncoming pimples
this does indeed help with acne.
i don't see any progress about my pimple on my chin :
it helped reduced my hormonal breakouts overnight
no dryness or flaking.
it is an unnecessary added chemical that tends to irritate skin or cause breakouts
no difference in discolorations at all
i got new pimples every single time i used
i rarely ever get a pimple
if you're prone to breakouts with thick moisturizers
although it may have helped some of the redness
the pimples themselves didn't diminish at all
pimples in my t-zone
this caused me terrible whiteheads all over my forehead
now, i have 3 big whiteheads on my chin.
i should mention that i do use an acne treatment
stress/hormonal acne prone skin
i've a combination skin prone to breakouts.
it worked extremely well for my redness
it didn't help with my acne
a good product for younger skin looking to prevent aging
have redness as is common in fair skinned people
excellent coverage for my redness
i always hear caucasian people with rosacea rave about it
this did nothing to improve the redness
i expected something that would not just cover redness
i won't deny that it does cover redness
it did even out minor blemishes on my cheeks
not to mention, it did not cover the redness.
it does remove redness
although this product does a good job of correcting blemishes
it definitely covers up any redness or acne scars
only had a minimal effect on redness
maybe this works best for someone with actual rosacea
more serious blemishes than i have
it's amazing at canceling out redness
it covers the redness in my cheeks
the coverage does work to cover redness
it helps cover my redness
all pimples are gone
also felt that i was getting wrinkles from the rubbing
this balm has given me the worst acne
i always get hormonal breakouts around my chin when it's my time of the month
straight up clogged pores and acne.
i won't be recommending this to anyone who has issues with acne or sensitive skin
product does nothing for eye puffiness.
adjusted my skin pigment for the worse
overnight this does help with puffiness
i always have dark under eyes and puffiness.
dryness or fine lines
my darkness and dryness hasn't improved.
some puffiness under my eyes
this stuff caused horrible breakouts
it caused me breakouts around my chin
noticed pimples on my cheeks
a few along my jawline
i am not sure if the pimples were due to the fragrance
i started using for redness
mild acne after being recommended by my coworker
however as for effectiveness i cannot say it helped with redness
blemishes all around my cheeks
too occlusive for my skin
i got this because of mild redness in my face.
this cream only aggravated my skin more
it helps healing big zit that has been popped
it can clog your pores if you have acne prone skin like me
it did help with redness as promised.
just use it on my legs to help with irritation from shaving
does not take away redness or heal skin the way it describes at all
actually thought i sawm more redness than usual when using
i did get small break outs around my cheeks where my rosacea flares
this had zero effect on my redness.
it didn't heal any of my hormonal acne
caused smaller breakouts all over
has actually worsened the dryness
since i use an acne-treatment
the redness or help with the blemishes
i wake up in the morning with redness still
when moisturizing usually clears the redness for me
why they would make a repairing lotion with irritating effects
reducing redness was a bonus
it does reduce the redness specially around my nose
it didn't reduce the redness
it would remove all my redness
it also didn't cover any acne spots
i love the effectiveness of this cream at reducing redness
this helps with the redness a little
does it cover redness?
i'd take my redness over the nasty
it will not cover acne that great
it will even out any redness
aside from occasional hormonal breakouts
the sides of my face due to improper treatment of my acne from when i was younger
it still looks like i have breakouts when really there is just redness left behind from acne that i have picked at or harshly treated in efforts to rid my face of it
given the fact that i still have acne marks
the fact that this treatment is said to neutralize redness was very appealing to me
my acne marks almost completely cancelled out
i really did not see much neutralization of my acne marks
my redness was still alive
i felt as though the product did not remove any of the redness from my acne marks
it definitely helped tone down the redness in my face
got this because i have a lot of redness on my cheeks
hide my redness with as little product as possible
did not hide my redness at all
this product does help with redness
this does correct redness as promised
it works for redness without a doubt
this stuff works great at minimizing redness!
because you barely have to use any to get excellent coverage over redness
normally a slight redness to my checks
a recent outbreak of flaky patches of rosacea on my checks makes this a no
it did reduce the redness a little bit
this product takes care of my redness!
i tried this treatment hoping it would correct some of the redness caused by rosacea
unfortunately wound up causing me more redness
mild-rosacea-afflicted skin
it did do a beautiful job of correcting my redness
notice new pimples coming up all over my cheeks
bought this because i have rosacea
some minor adult acne on my forehead that i can't seem to get rid of
it does nothing to cover my redness.
does nothing to really help my acne.
it takes a ton of redness out
tones down my acne scars substantially
i don't have acne prone skin
did a good job covering the redness
its not acne-prone
giving me huge pimples
it pills like crazy on my skin
felt because i've had hormonal acne for my entire adult life
i rarely , if ever , break out with acne.
i also love her eradikate™ acne treatment
dab it on a troubled pimple area
i love this product because it really calmed down my overall redness
the redness calms down
did not experience any allergic reactions or breakouts while using this product
i still am having acne spots appear
it also caused my skin to purge severely
my acne continued to worsen
i would recommend if your skin is not too acne prone
will not do wonders for acne woes
breakouts make that difficult
for my facial skin care
it caused more breakouts
i did have two breakouts
puffiness or dark circles
i honestly can't believe this has been dermatologist tested
didn't see many results in terms of reducing puffiness
it definitely helps with puffiness almost instantly
it also didn't really get rid of my puffiness.
i do on occasion have puffiness
my wrinkles still appear the same
but it also seemed to aggregate my acne too.
i've noticed that it caused breakouts in my chin
treated the redness dissipated
i will use a little less of the product to see if that impacts the redness
it almost looked like dandruff (eww i know).
i noticed small breakouts
this morning i woke up with redness
didn't notice any difference in redness
my skin was still flaking in some areas
i didn't see any improvement in my redness
first off my skin is oily and acne prone.
purchased this thinking it would sooth that redness
although it didn't calm the redness down it did moisturize my skin so well
i tried the makeup forever redness primer
26 dry/sensitive/acne prone
also flaking so bad
i assumed it was the acne medicine i was on
i also got major redness
the next day i had several pimples pop up on my forehead
i rarely get breakouts
has it helped my blackheads?
not small pimples either.
with an occasional pimple here
it is not worth zits
i used a fan to relieve the sensation of itchiness
little whiteheads would appear all over my forehead
i do not have acne prone skin
it works well without causing irritation.
scaly after one use
stings like a bad sunburn
was able to leave this on for 20 with no discomfort or redness
little breakouts on my forehead
using it gave me little whiteheads
's claims to even out skin's discoloration
my skin is peeling from retinol that i currently use once in a while
it also made my skin breakout with a few pimples.
i also didn't see any change in my acne scars.
it hasn't caused additional clogged pores or breakouts for me
unfortunately it didn't help with breakouts
i also didn't notice much of a difference in my acne scars
i typically have clear skin with the occasional pimple
i get awful hormonal breakouts on my chin during my time of the month
some of my smaller blackheads cleared up
constantly had mild breakouts
tend to only get very mild acne on my cheeks
never got rid of any acne
still am suffering with flakiness
while my acne breakout started to subside after 2 uses
well this product did work for the puffiness under my eye
i don't get any pimples at all
and breakouts for me are rare!
small pimples even though i don't use that much
this serum does blur the skin
followed by firmness/puffiness
after a month of use i noticed the skin under my eyes was flaking/peeling where i have light wrinkles
help with wrinkles/texture improvement
woke up with 3 red pimples :
or a reduction in the puffiness there
my breakouts actually got worse
i've suffered from acne since 10
it occasionally caused redness.
i must say i have acne prone
my mouth area being dry with some redness
helps with the acne.
did cause a lot of redness in my skin
i even got a pimple which i am attri
smells awful and gave me contact dermatitis.
it didn't cause any irritation or breakouts
i notices some breakouts on my forehead
it applied very blotchy.
this product didn't cause breakouts
in terms of healing acne scars
causes breakouts around the orbital bone
mild rosacea-having skin
mild rosacea-having skin
it also makes me itch
maybe 1 pimple/blemish a month if i do.
i broke out with small pimples
it's definitely not for someone with acne

i tested it out on my jawline
this product gave me the worst breakouts
i get a couple of hormonal pimples around my monthly

also with many breakouts
for oily acne prone skin but caused bad breakout.
for someone who doesn't have acne prone skin
my blackheads were back
this product did not remove my blackheads
the blackheads were still there
the blackheads disappeared right after the mask can off
i've had blackheads on my nose
my blackheads are still very much there
can't use most blackhead or acne masks as they make my skin too dry
i really saw no reduction in blackheads
this did nothing for deep in-pore blackheads
not good for acne-prone or sensitive
my acne scars did seem to lighten a bit as well.
i still had all the pimples
the redness was something i expected to happen
the breakouts i've been getting stopped
watch out if you have sensitive skin or dermatitis
caused breakouts all over.
my skin are getting more breakouts
i think it's causing blemishes
i got three zits
usually don't have acne anymore
i see no reduced puffiness or darkness
caused breakouts in t-zone
it did not brighten my skin nor did it fade my hyperpigmentation
sadly had to return it because it caused my acne
i really need to do something about the blackheads on my nose
it basically completely got rid of my blackheads
my blackheads were back the next day
i started getting acne around my eyes
i've tried many eye creams
i also am still experiencing puffiness
product gave me acne all around my eyes within 2 days of use
my skin has been flaking
it left the skin scaly
my face was filled with acne
my redness stayed the same
was causing the congestion
until the pimples started forming the next day
the tingling sensation after 5 minutes was unbearable
use at the risk of your nasal passage.
), and now my forehead has tiny acne bumps!

noticeable at my hair line
(i have dry acne prone skin)
dry skin, acne, discoloration).
the scars will lighten

a zit on my forehead
not for acne prone skin
made skin super itchy
it made skin itch again
not necessarily acne breakouts
my skin would itch
this stuff says that it helps reduce the appearance of facial hair
got a huge pimple on forehead
it definitely caused pimples for me
seems to cause my skin to breakout
so here we go:skintype:combo/acne prone
i developed some acne
my redness did diminish
i woke up to zits
whiteheads on my nose
i saw no visible change to my skin except redness
i still see some redness peaking
i never have acne on my face
while i don't have textured skin from acne or bumps from dry skin
i did notice lightening in my hyper pigmentation
it caused a few breakouts as well.
though the positive thing about it was my acne scars fading a bit
pimples aren't worth it
made my face more prone to breakouts
never issues with acne or blemishes.
did not seem to do anything for puffiness or lines/wrinkles
the acne spot got dried out
at the age of 32 i don't need something that makes my hormonal/stressed induced acne worse
my blackheads are still in place
hormonal pop ups every now
acne-prone adult skin
i hoped it would reduce my acne scars
the serum also caused breakouts across my forehead
i needed a night time gel to help combat redness
although the formula helped reduce some of my redness
it does help reduce some of my redness
i realized that i was developing prominent whiteheads
35-year-old skin with mild rosacea
the redness on my face got worse
helped with my redness from rosacea a little bit
it caused me to break out with a lot of pimples
reducing the redness there by a bit
lighten some acne scars
i also had a reaction where i got red itchy blotches on my skin from this cleanser
i didn't do much for my dry acne-prone skin either
i've used it to spot treat hyper-pigmentation from acne
it did seem to help the redness fade faster
i am migraine prone triggered by scents.
long-lasting breakouts even after i've stopped using it
zits popped after 1st using it.
applying it exclusively to my cheeks- where i never get zits
from the reviews it seems to work well for acne prone skin
tiny whiteheads after using this just once
was left with unwanted scars
a few zits along my chin
acne scars as i was led to believe
am not prone to acne
except for the occasional stress or menstrual pimple
she told me it would help with the acne scars i have on my cheeks
immediately had an entire face of huge pimples
i started to notice breakouts
had high hopes as i'm still trying to find that miracle product to help fade my acne scars
little pimples in areas that i regularly didn't get acne are now flooded with small spots :
found myself dealing with crazy acne all over my face
most vitamin c's irritate my skin
my skin has less breakouts and is more brighter.
my face broke out rosacea intensified.
used it 2 days and the zits were back.
om pimples popping up more frequently
does not help with breakouts
my forehead acne got worse
why a product that is meant for "oily/acne prone" skin would have such ingredients in it
if you are very acne prone
would also help with redness
it seems to have made the redness worse
it didn't clears the acne
had acne along my chin
acne prone skin that has been suffering with dryness over these winter months
i literally could feel the acne forming on my forehead
pimples on my forehead that got worse as i use it
had an allergic reaction to it
it smells like muscle ache cream.
and i rarely get any pimples!
which was what probably caused the acne
i tried my best to blemish the acne away
acne prone skin with bright red scarring from my acne
while my acne hasn't gotten worse
a few years ago i stumbled upon a retinol from philosophy that did wonders for my acne
it hasn't helped my acne
i realize this is not meant to treat acne
any pimples or breakouts i have disappear or are significantly reduced
after 4 weeks of use:i'm 30 with some mild hormonal acne from time to time
aren't full blown pimples
pus-filled pimples in areas where i would never normally breakout
because i'm now dealing with hyperpigmentation from the breakouts
it didn't help with acne
it doesn't cause acne either
all i received was an extra dose of acne
except creating some redness
some wrinkles on my forehead
it gave me more pimples !!!!
like really big under the skin pimples on my chin
clearing up acne scars
keeping acne under control
doesn't make a big difference with skin discoloration
skin firmness or any other known effects that retinol has
i mean zits all over
usually just have hormonal/ forehead acne
it cleared up all my forehead acne
i also noticed hormonal acne would come to a head right away
i don't have a retinol allergy....
had 6 really big pimples
no irritation or dryness at all.
help clear past acne marks on my cheeks
my acne scars have not faded
it has not prevented fine lines or acne
it definitely doesn't help puffiness or dark circles
it did diminish some puffiness
fine lines or puffiness
i see no brightness on my face or any reduction in the puffiness i experience
didn't see any difference in puffiness
really wanted to see the puffiness immediately decrease
i think it gets me puffiness
this product doesn't help with any puffiness or dark circles
just a normal eye gel for summer.
had the puffiness been reduced
puffiness were more pronounced than they normally are
only helped with puffiness slightly
has not diminished puffiness
fair-skinned with freckles
can't run away from my wrinkles
i think it might reduce the puffiness
didn't feel it did anything noticeable for puffiness
i didn't have wrinkles to begin with
making my blackheads worse somehow
the truth is the creams from my dermatologist did a much better job of clearing my acne
wouldn't recommend this as a way to treat acne
it didn't treat my acne
normal skin for forehead
i got many redness on my cheek
my skin is normal/somewhat sensitive with minimal aging/wrinkles for my age of 41
i continued to use this product because i'm acne prone
i did not get any pimples
by the fourth day of use i had contact dermatitis all over my face
or acne-prone skin
a sephora consultant recommended this to me because i have moderate acne
little to know acne problems
left a residue that caused breakouts.
almost like an allergic reaction
i am seeing more breakouts
safe for my acne prone skin
acne prone from 4 years of living in houston
my acne has gotten progressively worse
i've gotten the occasional acne before
although not acne-prone
caused me to break out with small pimples all over my face
not really pimples or blemishes
have had more pimples
this made my face itch all over
it has never cleared up a pimple overnight
purchased this item for my acne scars
dark spots from post acne
it did nothing to reduce my breakouts nor redness
it minimized my acnes
i could still feel the acne bumps on my skin after using the whole stick
sensitive skin with persistent acne
this didn't make my acne worse
sometimes i get the occasional pimple which can be stubborn
this boscia spot treatment didn't do anything to help get rid of my pimples
i've tried this on multiple blemishes
this product did not treat my acne.
i found this to be a little to gentle for my acne
this treatment is gentle unlike some other spot treatments
this product relieves irritation
doesn't diminish the appearance of acne spots
this is the one acne cream that didn't make the slightest difference
usually to treat only 1-2 zits
this did absolutely nothing for my acne.
returned the murad acne spot treatment
not better ive given up on all acne spot treatments
it didn't provide relief for redness or prevent bumps from forming
people said that works for acne
am extremely acne prone
this treatment was not irritating
the acne blemishes did not disappear instantly
didn't cause my skin to peel like normal acne treatments which was good
useless since it has no effects on my acne
this treatment didn't help my acne.
i still got zits.
unfortunately, this hasn't helped my acne at all.
it was one of the most gentle acne treatments i have ever used
it may have helped some in the prevention of acne
experienced horrible burning sensation
it definitely helps with the dryness
it did not cause any irritation
am trying to prevent wrinkles early one
main concerns are preventing undereye wrinkles from worsening
it's great for wrinkles
doesn't really seem to do much in terms of reducing puffiness or dark circles or wrinkles or anything drastic
did not see any brightening i have a lot of discoloration
my skin didnt feel itchy at all because of dryness
i recommend the sleeping facial
this lotion is not as good as the sleeping facial in terms of reducing redness
purchased this in the winter when i have problems with dryness
i am not a person that gets acne.
resulted in really big pimples
my skin didn't develop new breakouts
does nothing for acne-prone skin
i've noticed a little bit of acne clearing up
it did nothing to help control/prevent breakouts
skin dullness or have dry skin
usually just worry about redness
i loved the acne treatment gel
i did not see any improvement with redness.
the wash didn't do much for my redness
dry along with having rosacea
they recommended me bliss for acne
i rarely get zits
i didn't notice any difference in the redness factor of my face as i have mild rosacea
did nothing for my redness.
does not seem to clean very well or eliminate any redness
the redness caused by the scars from the acne to fade
i do still get some redness, but it's reduced.
makes the redness worse
if hoping it helps your redness in the face
have combination skin with some oiliness
redness has not reduced
she said it was good for acne
i felt it was causing more redness then anything
blackheads elsewhere on my face
i constantly have blackheads
i wouldn't recommend it for adult acne
it does have a small amount of retinol
made me break out with a pimple so large that i had to see a dermatologist to get a injection to shrink it
it really did transform my rosacea prone skin
use clinique redness cream instead.
caused breakouts on my normal to dry skin
did alleviate some redness temporarily.
i invested in this to see if it would help calm my redness
help with my redness
after a few hours the redness was even worse.
it says it soothes redness
my redness still looks the same from day one
this product did nothing to decrease the redness or dryness on my face
it does calm my skin and reduce the redness.
my poor skin was going through some hormonal imbalances
said it helps with hormonal breakouts
during this time i had minor skin irritation because of allergies
bought this for my mom because she has severe rosacea
a long time sufferer of rosacea
and i feel it made the redness worse.
it hasn't diminished the redness in the slightest
it actually caused breakouts
bought this along with other dermadoctor products for my acne-prone skin
i don't have rosacea
thought it would be good for my acne-prone skin
did nothing for my redness and dry skin.
my derm told me that the only treatment for my rosacea was laser therapy
if you think you have rosacea
i don't have rosacea
this product did nothing to combat the redness
not intended for redness removal from rosacea
this cream reduces my redness only temporarily
it helped me with my rosacea, but it broke me up.
it does little to help with any redness or rosacea
this did not help my acne or fine lines at all.
now i use the murad anti aging/anti acne line with much better results
was very excited to try this product for my rosacea
it didn't do anything for the redness.
i still have redness
this has helped my rosacea
my redness was not reduced
the cream does nothing to tone down the redness.
since clinique redness solutions daily relief cream quit working for me
i did notice a bit of reduction in redness
didn't help with my blemishes
i still have some redness
the redness is better than before
i don't have rosacea
it has no efeect whatsoever with my slightly redness on my cheeks
i used it faithfully for 2 months for my redness.
has not helped with breakouts
mild acne on my shoulders
purchased for my body acne.
at 42 years old, i still have acne prone skin.
woke up the next day with redness and bumps.
had pimples all on my forehead
i woke up with a couple pimples :/
it gave me too many pimples
get acne from time to time
my major issues are discoloration
also gave me bumps and acne.
bugged my allergies to no end
still had a few breakouts from this product
my pale acne-scarred face is back to normal
this product worked for my forehead dryness
i've never had such bad acne in my life.
this is different than hyper-pigmentation
ing to acne flare-ups
it enhanced my acne scars even more
after a full bottle using twice a day i didn't see any real change in dark spots or hyperpigmentation
it does reduce some of the puffiness of the eyes
i do notice a mild decrease to puffiness.
i found the cream made the skin around my eyes red perhaps i was allergic to some of the ingredients
my puffiness is still there
another user mentioned that this pills on dry skin
actually did nothing on my skin except some pimples on my forehead
i am prone to migraines
if my skin gets too dry it causes more acne
i saw no improvement with my blackheads or large pores
i think this cleanser would be very effective for someone with acne or severe skin problems
my acne prone skin as cleared some since i began using the product
gives me more blackheads instead
still cannot stop the breakouts
still had pimples popping up
im 34 yrs old, and have an acne prone skin.
it didn't clear up my acne or make my pores appear smaller
i don't have blemishes
this product it very heavy for acne prone skin.
it made my skin itch!
as i developed some whiteheads
while this product seemed to help even out redness
it did nothing to help with my blackheads or acne
think my skin is sensitive to the menthol used as a counter-irritant in this product
used it after a sunburn
i got a serious sunburned.
i didn't have a sunburn or any stinging
i also experienced tingling
it caused closed comedones on my cheeks
it instantly reduced the dryness
recommended this cream to me as it was supposed to help with dark spots/acne scarring
it also "pills" on my face.
i occasionally use epiduo for acne spot treatment
although needed a little bloating mid-day
i've never had trouble with acne until now.
i got a couple pimples as well.
each time i ended up with whiteheads
did not help my acne
had acne after using
found it no longer wards off the wrinkles
now i have like 4 zits
it may help with puffiness
i never get pimples
doesn't irritate my eyes like most eye creams
i rarely use eye creams.
there is retinol in it
i do however have major puffiness
maybe it's helping with puffiness?
did nothing for the puffiness
did not diminish wrinkles
my skin burned with continuing discomfort for several days
either an allergic reaction or may be my sensitive skin
no reduction of wrinkles or dark circles
a few people have said there's a tingling sensation
the complexion correction pads
although ptr products have lessened my acne considerably
after using this cream for 3 days i developed huge pimples on my chin
after one use my face broke out in big fat pimples
it does absolutely nothing for under eye wrinkles
my wrinkles are not deep
i've never had irritation problem with eye cream/gel
not better than other eye creams i have used.
smoothed my wrinkles, but .
it did not appear to fill in my wrinkles like some other eye creams do
it also didn't decrease puffiness.
i started getting breakouts
on my usually acne-free skin
some acne around the chin area
as another reviewer stated i found that this pilled when put over acne medicine
it is very blotchy
there are way better eye contour creams out there
had an allergic reaction to this product.
there are much better eye creams on the market.
only the very beginnings of wrinkles
wrinkles around the eye area
it did work well to moisturize my skin however it did cause some breakouts
the acne solutions actually seemed to combat "redness"
the acne treating one did the same
promoting the formation of acne
i don't really have puffiness or circles
this clinique product caused teeny pimple-like bumps next to each eye
it won't help with acne or large pores.
it did sting if you have broken skin from pimples though
i struggle with hormonal acne
it is good for reducing puffiness
it's helped somewhat with puffiness
i won't say it helps with wrinkles
treatment for puffiness this is for you
did not reduce puffiness
it really didn't help any puffiness either.
i also didn't notice much of a decrease in puffiness
it certainly doesn't brighten any dark circles caused by allergies
still in the market of seeking better eye creams.
it helps with puffiness and dark circles.
s of eye creams over the years
it doesn't diminishe my appearance of eye puffiness or darkness
don't expect it to reduce puffiness
never had this problem with origin eye creams.
whiteheads on my forehead
the rest of my face is normal with acne
caused my acne to scar
also some dryness around my mouth
did nothing for the dryness on my nose
takes down a bit of my redness
it did nothing for acne or pore size or dry skin
it had no last affects on redness
as i noticed my skin becoming blotchy
was very gentle on my acne prone skin
other than that pretty normal skin with occasional breakouts
i get this irritable stinging reddness
probably not for anyone with combination skin or anyone prone to acne
that made my skin itch in outdoor activities
this lotion didn't cause breakouts
it actually noticeably reduced my forehead wrinkles
i don't usually have acne prone skin
i don't have a severe acne prone skin
is ok for a "very mild-acne prone skin"
i started getting breakouts
if you are in any way acne prone
it left a lot of redness
it didn't cause any irritation
there are few eye creams with spf in them
it does nothing to fine lines or puffiness or wrinkles
ed these symptoms from my environment
it is not acne fighting.
when i drop money it has to be acne fighting or exfoliating or some other noticeable effect
this doesn't seem to really help prevent acne
brought my acne back
acne prone skin like me
redness--also am prone to both
while it helped with the redness
sadly all i was left with was scarring
not inducing any dryness
my acne got worse
pretty intense scarring occurred
i got acne in places i would never
the acne kept getting worse
after switching to a new cleanser within a day my huge pimples were gone
now i have acne scars that i would never have
without any acne fighting ingredients
this caused me scarring
usually a pimple every once in a while
it was disappointment as i have a skin condition excessive dryness
discoloration weren't masked with this
get skin pen treatments from your dermatologist
it did not cause any breakouts
it also led to some breakouts
if you are not prone to breakouts
left it with redness
highly acne prone skin
wrinkles in my forehead from expression
i don't think this product will prevent wrinkles
this did not help my fine lines or acne scars/hyperpigmentation
this made my forehead breakout in big whitehead pimples after one use
i developed a large pimple the next day.
now i have redness
i probably need something stronger since i have so many acne scars
this serum does lighten pigmentations
because no eye-brightening treatment has ever worked for me--my dark circles are caused by a combination of allergies
after 1 hours i had really bad nausea :s
it did not help my skin look clearer or help with any existing blemishes/breakouts
although it doesn't seem to cause irritation
it did not improve my acne
it does nothing for my acne.
as i have acne
it is not very effective for preventing hormonal breakouts
does not have the horrible burning sensation most acne medicine has
my acne hasn't gotten worse
but it did nothing for my acne.
when i started to get blemishes
it does nothing to get rid of my pimples.
it does get rid of blackheads
her pimples are not clearing up.
so never see the full affect of reducing blackhead/acne
my post-acne marks
doesnt dry me out or increase redness
it has cleared up her acne
no improvement with dryness
context: i have dry skin with occasional pimples.
it also burns my face
then i follow with an acne wash
seemed to aggravate my rosacea
this product gave me the worst breakouts
it was not good for my combination 30-something acne prone skin
since it's an allergy
i wanted the night cream to help prevent wrinkles
i don't have deep wrinkles yet
the scent gave me a migraine so unfortunately had to return it
my skin looked blotchy
i can be prone to breakouts
seems to be reducing wrinkles
then it interacted with my acne medicine if i spread it too low
teenage i did suffer from some acne
my wrinkles are even more visible now.
it gave me pimples.
by the end of the day i noticed a couple of new pimples on my skin
right now i started having small acne around my cheeks area
so moisturizing without getting shiny or causing breakouts is always a challenge
that can cause breakouts
caused breakouts on my cheeks
i try not to use oily products because of my acne
not for acne prone.
my light hyperpigmentation marks still look the same
i got pimples from it
i definitely had some noticeable pimples here
worst of all it makes my whiteheads even more prominent
my whiteheads are a bit more pronounced
as someone with combination skin who often deals with acne
my acne has gotten noticeably worse
this cream even brings the dryness worse
which i have never really gotten acne before
get some acne on my forehead after using this.
ashy spots on my skin from using occasional acne treatments
i got pimples all over my face after using only once
have fine lines caused by dehydration
see absolutely no difference in my undereye puffiness
it does nothing when it comes to puffiness
since it advertises that it targets puffiness
didn't help at all with my fine lines or wrinkles
doesn't really help with puffiness or fine lines
i don't have issues with puffiness
it doesn't eliminate oiliness or breakouts
it was not doing anything to clear/clean my blackheads or my little whitehead acne blemishes on my forehead
pros: did not aggravate my acne
it did not improve my acne
i am not acne prone at all
my face has blackheads around my nose
gave it a go with my oily acne prone skin
it didnt seem to cause any breakouts
they also caused redness
it did nothing for my acne
since i've used this product my skin has become very dry to the extend i had to see a dermatologist
red cysts on my face
the anti- redness serum
sephora consultant recommended this to me because i have fair redness prone skin
even with the new pumps/acne flare ups
caused more acne than i'm used to
i used this hoping that it would calm my redness
had a few breakouts with using this
it made my acne flair up
many eye creams have made my eyes more puffy
i can't use heavy creams due to milia
didn't seem to reduce puffiness at all
i don't have deep wrinkles
do have slight puffiness
irritated whiteheads all over my chin
no effects on my blackheads - at all.
i did not really see a difference in my acne as i suffer from hormonal acne
no change in blackheads
it helps eliminate breakouts
i tend to have congested skin
it works well as spot treatment on blemishes
i didn't see a huge improvement with my acne
it's the only wash that has effectively controlled my light acne
it did not prevent any breakouts or improve skin.
i really expected my acne to be gone
my acne is not better
did nothing for my very oily, acne ridden skin!
this just made the acne pop up again
honestly i was skeptical at first because i had literally tried every product for my hormonal acne
not only has my acne greatly reduced
since i have adult acne
cheeks were completely covered in small whiteheads
almost always have breakouts
yet effective acne treatment to help get rid of my acne
i found that it did help to clear up my acne
i ended up using it on most of my face as i'm prone to acne
mild acne that flares up at that time of the month
most of it is hormonal acne
after reading such positive feedbacks regarding this product's efficacy against hormonal chin acne
i usually get acne on my chin
used for two weeks to help control my moderate acne
i got this because other acne medications were too drying
the lady said this is actually allergy tested
my acne continued to be just as bad
this has not caused dryness or flakiness
it helped a little in preventing more breakouts
did absolutely nothing for my adult acne-ridden skin
noticed that my acne does clear out faster
found that to be even more effective against acne
the product works for blackheads
not for deep acne
my acne scares are even darker
might work on mild acne
my acne didn't appear to improve
even gave me acne on my forehead
it wasn't harsh to cause irritation
has not been a miracle worker or even helped my blackheads or dry skin
it doesn't really help with my acne
i think this product also has the potential to make acne worse if the exfoliation is not-so-mild for sensitive skin
i tried using it for texture issues/acne
does not cause irritation
silicone isn't supposed to cause breakouts.
acne prone sensitive skin
i still don't see any improvement in discoloration
just saw no lightning of the acne spots
didn't really help reduce blemishes or quality of skin
not good as i expectedhave mild skin irritations~
did absolutely nothing for my wrinkles.
my wrinkles may even be worse.
puffiness is not normally an issue for me.
in my undereye wrinkles
it think it helped with redness
it gave me so many pimples
avoid this if you have trouble with acne
dryness through my chin area
this product worked wonders for my acne prone
after a week i saw no difference in "sebum production" or hormonal breakouts
i usually do not get blackheads
i started to notice blackheads on my forehead
if your skin is oily or acne-prone
however, it has not helped me with my acne.
the pimples that's been significantly getting bigger before i used this product
currently have no acne products
the breakouts still occurred
make my acne getting worse
didn't really help with acne much.
i mainly suffer from pms breakouts
i still got breakouts
my acne was not going away
have never had acne this bad my whole life
the acne solutions clarifying lotion
it did not clear my acne
it didn't treat any blemishes
i never had bad acne
i started getting some serious pimples all over my face
i got huge pimples on my cheeks after using this cleansing foam
i am acne prone
wanted to get rid of my acne with something powerful
didn't help with breakouts at all...
as far as acne
did nothing for my acne
also- didn't really help with my acne.
i only have me acne
it definitely prevented more acne
i used this product to try to clear up mild acne
i experienced no reduction in breakouts
this was my primary acne spot treatment for over a year
unlike other acne treatments i tried in the past
worst part, it didn't even clear up the acne.
i found myself getting more acne spots
in the winter months there must be a better way to dry up pimples without dryness of skin
that works similarly well on acne
this product really does some work on my stress-induced acne
it also dries out my skin so bad that i actually had redness
redness isn't worth it
maybe it works if you use it as your only acne treatment
needed something to relieve my skin
i wouldn't recommend it for an overnight or "emergency" acne treatment
this doesn't seem to help prevent/get rid of all of my pimples
it works very well on some zits
not an actual acne cream
acne scars are slowly going away here
to stop having breakouts with hyper pigmentation
which was classified as probably hormonal by my dermatologist
i don't think it's helped my hyper pigmentation
visit your dermatologist asap to get the correct diagnosis
it's really helped fade the hyper pigmentation
eventually leaving me with dark spots/acne scars
have acne dark spots
hydroquinone only works on brown spots because it lightens skin
i think it actually may have given me some blackheads
don't see any changes to my acne scars
i can say this gel did reduce a lot of redness from when i first started using it
i don't really see any progress in my acne scars fading
does absolutely nothing to help dark spots/acne scarring
got better results from my dermatologist.
it may have helped me to reduce the redness.
did not fade away any acne scars or spots
stains my skin for months
my acne scarring is still there
an increase in acne did occur
my acne kept increasing
it left me with hyper-pigmentation which i couldn't bear
the acne marks have not faded -- not even a little bit
i've read that hydroquinone should not good for long term use
continue to suffer from breakouts
it does lighten blemishes
especially since i was using this with the murad acne spot treatment
it did work to get rid of lighter acne scars
i would recommend this for people who have lighter acne scars
i started getting acne in my 30s
i actually use this product on chicken pox scars
my scars look extremely similar to acne scars
it didn't make my acne scars worse
i think maybe it helped heal pimples a little bit faster
i used this for post-acne marks
as well as blemishes
the dark acne spots turned more red
my acne-prone combo skin did not like the oils
it did nothing to reduce wrinkles or firm my skin
some wrinkles around eyes
it did not clear my acne
never had facial acne
have had acne my whole life
i must use an acne soap daily on my face in order to keep blemishes under moderate control
my acne flared up much worse than usual
this product is so mild that if you are someone who actually needs a cleanser targeted at acne
maybe if you have mild acne and sensitive skin?
no improvement in my back acne
did not clear up my acne
had never tried anything from this acne line
this gave me more pimples
it has helped with my breakouts on my body
now red marks + breakouts
was hoping it would get rid of some of the large pimples
i've always struggled with acne
it did absolutely nothing for my acne or redness
like other acne products i've tried
no change in redness
this one is definitely not meant for sensitive or acne prone skin
almost felt like i was applying alcohol to my breakouts
also, i had worse acne break outs when using it.
not for people who have acne prone skin
it didn't help with my acne
i feel as though it's starting to help my acne a little
i usually have 1-2 blemishes at a time
which i am acne prone
suffer from blackheads on my nose
it was not an allergic reaction
it wasn't pimples either
stubborn acne that has flared up lately
was hoping it would get rid of some of the large pimples
this stuff made my acne worse
this made my acne worse
prevent my face from the acne flare ups i have
as far as my acne blemishes it did not do what i needed
this stuff made my acne worse.
for people who only deal with mild acne
i did see a slight reduction in my acne
as far as treating acne no difference
i wanted to clear the persistent low-level acne i always seem to have without resorting to bleaching
used for a month to no effect on clearing acne or blackheads
it didn't reduce or prevent any blemishes
not worth the money to reduce hormonal acne
did nothing for my acne
have recently been experiencing breakouts on my forehead
a sephora associate suggested this acne fighting/preventing serum
still, it did not seem to rid my acne.
didnt really clear my breakouts
help reduce the blackheads/acne
unfortunately it really didn't do much controlling oil or the blackheads/acne
for redness it's a loser
the redness did not improve either.
doesnt cause any tightness or dry patches
my skin still has redness
my redness is not from acne
i love all the other redness solutions products
it did not reduce my redness whatsoever
does not decrease the acne or redness for me
did not help with redness
i got this in the redness solutions kit
at least it does not aggravate my redness like some other cleansers
t isn't going to cause a flare-up of rosacea
pretty 'normal' with no breakouts or sensitivity issues
having skin that's a double whammy of acne prone
not marketed it as a "redness solution"
non irritating on my rosacea skin
since i have considered myself to be a fan of the redness solution daily relief cream for awhile
the redness solutions products work best
or even eliminate my redness
while i have not been formally diagnosed with rosacea
cream did nothing to reduce my redness
did not help very much with the redness
maybe if i use the redness solution lotion it would help more
i did notice redness reduction right after i used this
the redness came back
wanted a gentle cleanser that would counteract the redness
this has done nothing to help the redness
it did reduce redness
works great with the other redness solutions products
it didn't help my allergy related redness- i get red faced with the arrival of spring pollen
i got this for some recent redness i was having on my face
it is not for oily or acne prone skin
... don't see much redness reduction
do not find this $60 cream to work for redness reduction at all
my face is still suffering from redness
suffer from rosacea pretty bad
it definitely did not help the redness whatsoever
i guess it works for people who just have slight facial redness
my rosacea still there plus my face got oily with this product
i also started to get the worst acne
it does not reduce redness
does nothing to calm my redness on my skin
i've always struggle with redness correction
it doesn't help redness at all
when it comes to redness correction that's a negative
this has not done one thing to resolve or lessen my redness
i really hope they don't discontinue the moisturizer because of its ineffectiveness for redness though
it has not reduced or masked the redness on my cheeks at all
i got quite a few samples of the clique redness line
it cleared up my redness right away
a bit of horomonal acne as well
by night time my cheeks were broken out in pustules
i did notice a bit of a reduction in my redness
didn't help with slight redness in skin.
caused itching and bumps all over my face.
my redness is getting worse
didn't do much for my redness
this moisturizer cream did not help with redness it made the redness more red
cause the area to be itchy
this is not for sensitive acne prone skin.
while hoping to reduce my redness
i've never been diagnosed with rosacea
my persistent redness is very similar to a friend's who has been diagnosed
this is a good oil-free moisturizer that didn't cause breakouts on my acne-prone skin
it doesn't affect redness in any way at all though
it doesn't say that it will diminish redness
in my defense, "redness solutions" is misleading.
causes breakouts within a day or two
i don't usually have problems with product-related breakouts
my skin will breakout
it does not reduce redness at all
i did not see any reductions of redness on my skin
i think maybe with the redness solutions powder this will have more effect
my derm told me that clinique was the best for rosacea
it aggravated my skin
causing those annoying bumps
also has not reduced one bit of redness.
• perhaps my rosacea was more server than this line could help
in this time my rosacea hasn’t improved
acne prone with rosacea
now i am in my type ii of rosacea
i really like this cream as it did help me with my redness
the clinique redness solutions cream did not help get rid of my persistent redness
this is the first clinique redness cream i've tried
does not remove redness or even skin tone
using a greenish primer to reduce the appearance of redness
this product did not reduce redness.
did nothing for my redness
would not recommend it for those looking to tone down redness
it made my face itchy
it doesn't help fade acne scars
just adds more acne
acne marks for me to deal with
it doesn't minimize pores or fade acne scars/marks
haven't noticed a difference in any of the acne scarring i have on my jaw
this did nothing to even my skintone or reduce my hyperpigmentation
the pimples aren't the normal kind either
acne prone skin tread carefully with this one
however i don't find that it diminishes hyper pigmentation at all
i don't like the breakouts
i mentioned that to associate at sephora while inquiring about a mask to help with acne scars
the pigmentation on my face seemed to even out
demising the darkness of acne scars at the beginning
also did nothiing for after party puffiness....
i've tried plenty of eye creams
have slight wrinkles under my eyes
does not help with puffiness or dark circles
this product give me acne
or acne prone skin
now that i am acne free
like i have a sunburn
it effected my allergies
with no known allergies
i used this moisturizer then shortly after went to apply the retina
i realize there are different schools of thought on whether or not gluten allergies can be triggered by cosmetics
not the kind of stinging you get with retinol
this product immediately gave my skin a burning sensation
woke up with numerous pimples around my mouth.
this stuff is the culprit for zits all over the place
it didn't irritate my skin
this product caused severe eye puffiness
product also burns my skin
the wrinkles i started with are the wrinkles
just fair, so no difference in puffiness
probably good for puffiness
it does help with puffiness.
at one time the perricone eye therapy products did work to reduce the puffiness under my eyes
i don't think my under eye puffiness is any better
i don't have puffiness or dark circles
this product really helps with my puffiness around the eyes
itchy blotches appear under my eyes
it didn't address the puffiness that it was recommended for
it did not decrease the under eye puffiness
well i actually had allergic reaction to it
has not helped with puffiness
i must be allergic to this product.
my skin was itchy
so first of all i'm allergic to it
i am prone to getting zits
it doesn't do anything to control pimples
it is a very good cleanser for people without acne prone skin
not combination or acne skin type
with continued use this eye cream caused my skin to become very dry
like entire patches of my face have had clusters of acne
i didn't see any toning of my skin
itchy even after putting serum
i developed a lot of pimples
it caused a lot of redness
i also got mild breakouts around my nose
i felt like it really calmed the redness in my skin
as my acne is countable
helps my skin redness
this cream did make my redness a lot worse
i feel like my redness is worsened by this product
this product did nothing to soothe my rosacea-prone skin
it didn't minimize redness
i struggle with some redness
does not moisturize well or decrease the very minimal redness i have due to winter weather
no breakouts after using this product.
did it reduce redness?
currently going through hormonal breakouts
maybe help the redness of my skin
ter in it which is a major no for anyone with acne prone skin
making any acne worse
if you are not acne prone
i used this in conjunction with the redness serum
they also caused redness
this was too thick for my oily acne prone skin
it didn't irritate my skin
can't say much for its effects on skin aging bc i have no wrinkles
nor the appearance of any wrinkles
the cream was not irritating to my sensitive skin that's prone to breakouts
the next day my entire face was covered in hideous acne
i don't even get acne at all
this product is really allergy for my skin.
i noticed it tingling
reduced the puffiness significantly
didn't harm my skin
whiteheads all along my cheeks
i scar when i get acne.
the whiteheads on my forehead hurt real bad.
it smell nicecons: not great on acne/blemish skin
it left me with some acne scarring
caused my skin to be ten times dryer
i love it on my frizz-prone hair.
i tried to use this in my coloured hair tips
i do not recommend if you have acne prone skin.
don't recommend for acne prone skin.
have normal to combination skin
the dryness just got worse
i also got 2 huge pimples from it.
the older formula never gave my sensitive skin problems
it caused breakouts and huge red acne on my face.
it induced huge red acne every time i've used it
this caused a severe breakout
it causes me to breakout
i got a couple breakouts
this product gives a slight burning sensation to the skin
for his tattoo while it healed
it doesn't irritate my rosacea
have developed allergies to other br
didn't bother my allergies
i tried out the whole acne line of murad products
blackheads on my cheek area
i get a ton of blackheads
i always buy the acne sets
it still didn't help my breakouts
i look like i have bad acne
not very prone to breakouts
the morning after i used this i had little pimples all over face
but it made my acne 10x worse!!
i don't have wrinkles yet
does nothing for my wrinkles
if you are acne prone at all, be careful.
have even developed some breakouts on my chin
it did nothing for my wrinkles
have to admit it has helped with the puffiness
the wrinkles would minimize right away
made my eyes itch
smoothed out some minor wrinkling
made my wrinkles look more pronounced
i still have flaking
my wrinkles not only look more pronounced
i really like this solution because it does help reduce the puffiness
recommended by someone at sephora for my acne flair to get rid of scarring
but does not work well with acne regimen.
it ended up drying out my skin way more than the retinoid gel prescribed by my dermatologist
my skin burns like mad
my retinol days are over
i look like i've gotten a bad sunburn
i don't think it did much in terms of fading my acne scars
this product left a rash
facial skin is red
with my spring allergies it really bothers me.
i've never had a problem with the smell of a cosmetic product
i developed a pimple along the jawline
dry acne prone skin with something for wrinkles
this cream turned out to be a very expensive skin irritant
i experienced quite a few breakouts while using it
acne prone combo skin
i literally had an allergic reaction.
it severely aggravated my skin
even my dry cheeks started to have pimples
i am not prone to breakouts
no real acne problems
i find for my acne prone
because of that i still have acne issues
maybe people with acne.
it did not help my acne whatsoever.
having acne prone skin
helps in clearing my pimples
didn't work at all for reducing acne or blackheads
my skin is prone to acne
it made my acne prone skin more oily
this didnt help my breakouts/acne at all!
i need a good deep clean for my very acne prone skin
it was not great for my acne
recently i decided to care for my acne prone skin
haven't seen an changes in my acne prone skin
stable number of zits around my mouth
i think it has helped my acne to some degree
it worked well on my acne-prone combination skin.
this moisturizer is great for acne prone skin or sensitive skin
i struggle with acne as well
i don't have acne.
it didn't cause breakouts or irritation
sometimes it can get extremely dry from harsh acne treatments
thanks to sommervilles awesome acne treatments
i really enjoyed this moisturizer for oily skin as it never exacerbated acne
my acne cleared up right away
that would help with wrinkles
now have a terrible contact dermatitis/skin allergy all over my face
picked this up because sephora got rid of the dermalquench clear acne treatment
or at least less redness
some patches on my face felt like sunburn.
i've had acne for 25 years
this does shrink the zits
i've had acne issues since i was a teenager
high end acne medications
honestly it made my acne worse
i tried it with a regular non-acne fighting face wash
it helped with my slight redness
did not cause any breakouts
found that this product stings when put on the acne
my skin is very redness prone as well.
this product gave me a lot of little pimples
have only used this when i have sunburn or when i've over exfoliated
good for aging skin
which is very acne-prone
am battling my old acne all over again
thought it was my night cream causing the breakouts
for the past several months i have been struggling with some adult hormonal acne which has been quite distressing
i noticed flaking all over my chin
i do not have acne prone skin normally
even nose have broken out in blackheads
if you are allergic to retinol
i tried two different eye creams
this product gave me allergic reactions after only two applications---redness
i started having a lot of blackheads--which i never used to before
i've always had hormonal imbalance skin problems
made my super sensitive rosacea prone skin break out
it made my acne-prone skin break out
i found breakouts occur
does not aggravate my acne
it's not really helping my acne
irritated my rosacea prone skin
probably due to post pregnancy hormonal changes
so my acne is hormonal
my acne has calmed down a bit
i still have a couple of pimples
this product is not for acne prone skin.
i still had my stubborn chin acne
i noticed breakouts all over face
it started fading my acne scars
decreased the look of my forehead wrinkles
this was recommended by my esthetician to help with my hyper pigmentation
both times i woke up with a couple new pimples
acne like never before
i am still waiting for the sunspots to disappear
it did nothing for my blackheads
this product doesn't do anything to loosen blackheads or whiteheads on the nose
get rid of some of the blackheads
there was no improvement at all in my blackheads
with blackheads being my only concern
after about 2 hours the redness was gone
sensitive blackheads that are extremely prominent on my face the next morning
it does not help the blackheads go away
i broke out on my face with blackheads
i still have blackheads on my face
my request was simple: get rid of my blackheads
did nothing for my blackheads.
blackheads are still there
i get little blackheads on my cheeks
my skin goes from a tingling sensation to a burning sensation
this didn't help in any way with my blackheads
this did nothing for my pores and blackheads.
i didn't do anything for my blackheads.
it didn't do anything for my blackheads
i can see my blackheads while it works
my blackheads still exist.
slight improvement in areas of discoloration from sun damage
told by my 30 something dermatologist to get this
don't have any wrinkles or crows feet yet
mostly under-eye wrinkles
went home with the worst migraine due to fish smell from the dmae
as with the eyelift
i woke up with 2 blemishes
i very rarely get blemishes
they also said it would get rid of old acne spots
the acne around my mouth got worse
it wanted this to be my solution to hormonal breakouts
suffer from alittle bit of acne on my jaw line
made my acne worse like it angered it
didn't eliminate all of my acne
first i don't have acne
a had pimples on my face those was not acne pimple
this did nothing for my acne.
it cleared some of my acne
it removed most of the redness on it
:/ was i this blotchy looking earlier?
the blemishes cleared right up
except for the breakouts
i now have pimples/bumps all over my chin
peels the scab over the pimple faster than usual when i breakout
reducing redness as the sephora consultant had promised
while i don't have a lot of acne scarring
noticed it reddened my skin
clinique has to be using additional ingrediants that cause acne
my skin does naturally get rid of scars
it caused my skin to breakout
i don't deal with puffiness
this eye cream doesn't help improving the condition
it might prevent from getting more wrinkles
it didn't do anything for my circles or puffiness
did not cause any irritation
it reduces puffiness a hair
it takes away any puffiness i have
or any product since i have no known allergies
the description says it can be used for those suffering from dryness
having a child of my own that dealt with reflux problems
i never got pimples before using this
helps a bit with puffiness
because this product seems to have helped reduce puffiness under one eye
it helps a tiny bit in the puffiness at first
noticed even more wrinkles
i found that this product has not done anything to address my severe case of extreme under eye puffiness
i don't have puffiness
made no improvement in puffiness
i don't really have a puffiness problem
this product might be better for puffiness though
puffiness now i have wrinkles under my eyes
i rarely get pimples
i am oily acne-prone skin
it's keeps my redness controlled
long term use no improvements on my redness
it works for mild redness relief
it helped with my aggravated rosacea
which is one of my redness triggers
pro: did reduce my redness due to rosacea
i got this as it was recommended by a worker to help the redness in my cheeks
it made my redness worse
gave me a severe migraine.
not for sensitive or acne prone skin.
received the worst acne breakout i've had in years
it does minimize the redness
as for redness due to breakouts
it does minimize the redness some
never noticed a difference in the redness in my cheeks
this did absolutely nothing in the way of redness
it did not help with the redness
doesn't seem to do very much to reduce redness.
it does nothing for my redness
really not helping with any redness that i have .
it made the redness around my nose even worse than before
this didn't do anything for the redness in my face
have some rosacea flare up here
i feel like it helped sooth any irritation
i didn't see any decrease in redness
this literally did nothing for my redness.
it was recommended by a sephora employee specifically for my redness
my redness didn't disappear or even minimize
no long term or immediate reduction in redness.
i am new to the whole flare-ups of flushed/redness
the sales associates call redness
this made me break out and increased my redness.
this did nothing for my facial redness.
while this didn't cause any flare-ups
i did nothing to decrease the redness of my face
didn't remove or improve redness
it caused large amount of breakouts
is a known skin irritant
this really didn't get rid of my redness at all.
this does not relieve redness at all
i don't have rosacea or anything
don't know how this would perform for someone with chronic facial redness
it does reduce the redness on my face
it may be better for someone with more redness.
i give it 2 stars because it says its supposed to relieve redness on the face
i didn't see any results on the redness on my cheeks
it definitely doesn't fix redness nor feels like a serum
my face is has slight redness around my nose
it does take away redness to a certain extent
took away the redness though.
did not contain redness at all
did not help with redness around my nose
it has done nothing to relieve any of the redness on my cheeks
does not help redness.
i am dry with redness on cheeks
did nothing for my redness
also, i did not see any reduction in redness.
though i've been told it's not rosacea
i didn't notice any improvement in redness with this serum
it didn't reduce redness at all
i can literally see the redness in my skin diminishing as i was
did not clear up redness even a little bit
'm always on the lookout for things to help with redness
has done nothing for my redness
it did not reduce the redness i experience on my cheeks
this does reduce mild redness which is what i have
it reduces redness when i put it on
it diminished and healed my acne, overnight.
however, it did not diminish any redness.
it actually made the redness worse.
i do think i see a little less redness
it didn't have any affect on my facial redness.
if you suffer with rosacea
no dissipation of redness whatsoever.
i get occasional redness
i don't think it stops the redness at all
it didn't bring down the redness at all
which is supposed to be good for rosacea
i usually don't have this reaction to most "normal" face treatments
sensitive skin with rosacea
my redness showed up in my mid-40s.
it's not from rosacea.
i don't really think it helps with redness
not for what it claims to do which is get rid of redness
does take away some redness, but not completely.
i woke up with my rosacea bumps again after weeks of being without them
also saw no redness relief so i returned it.
hoping that it would at least diminish some of the redness on my cheeks
i think it might be time to see a dermatologist as no redness product has actually helped me yet
it doesn't take a lot of redness away
i would say this product does not cause any additional redness or irritation
did nothing for my redness :
it didn't do much for my acne
the only acne scar i have is still the same
i would expect some minor peeling with use of a retinol at 1%
have tried so many retinol products
that it might penetrate some stubborn fine wrinkles that the creams did not
acne scarring on my cheeks
this product has not caused any breakouts
i noticed more wrinkles with this
then the breakouts come
i am not really pimple prone
acne-prone because of those two factors
my skin is not prone to acne
it caused breakouts for me
out of my hairline to prevent breakouts
not for acne prone or oily skin.
made my wrinkles st
it did nothing for my oily acne prone skin
not for people with any type of acne issues
this product was recommended to me to get rid of some acne issues i was having
however, i found it causes some redness.
wrinkles are getting worse
it got rid of the dryness
beware if you are prone to acne.
i do get about a pimple a week
usually i have some mild problems with my skin drying out
that usually only affects me when i use facial cleansers
it also caused a few pimples to start forming for me
after that is causing breakouts on my forehead
whiteheads at this point
used on any pimples i had on my back
wanted to try something directed at acne
i decided to try this after hearing how wonderful it is for hormonal acne for adults with dry skin
tried this cleanser since i suffer with acne
i experienced so much more redness
this helped my redness
i didn't expect breakouts
i am still getting breakouts.
my whole face is now covered in acne
it didn't caused any irritation to my sensitive/combination/acne prone skin skin
made my acne appear even worse
caused breakouts on the third use
still have hormonal breakouts
did nothing for my acne prone skin.
i hasn't helped my acne
i sometimes found the serum irritating to my eyes
my skin isn't particularly acne-prone
it even helped with the dryness of my skin
yet it still caused breakouts.
up to recently when i realized that my face is completely covered with blackheads
it doesn't reduce redness
i started noticing more acne than usual on my face
my acne spread everywhere
jawline which i never get acne on
after using it for a few weeks i have developed terrible acne on my chin
yes it kind of reduces puffiness
therefore the puffiness reduction doesn't say much about the formula
this product does not minimize the appearance of puffiness due to the lack of caffeine in the ingredient
this product does not help puffiness.
my eyes are still a bit puffy due to allergies
i really wanted this to be the answer to my puffy allergy eyes
i don't notice any difference in my under eye puffiness
it hasn't done anything for my under-eye puffiness
it does nothing for undereye circles or puffiness
also due to recent months of insomnia
this product didn't appear to do anything at all to diminish the puffiness
it really doesn't do much for the puffiness
the puffiness will decrease more
it didn't do anything for puffiness or under-eye bags
don't see any real difference in undereye puffiness
the combination of the two products made my skin itch
i feel like it aggravates my acne a bit
it does nothing for dark circles or puffiness.
i don't have wrinkles or dry skin
it doesn't help with dark circles or puffiness
no effect on puffiness
this product claims to reduce puffiness
just a heads up for anyone who has sensitive or allergies
caused some irritation with my eyes
surgery will get rid of wrinkles
doesn't fade acne scars
i dont have acne normally
get rid of acne/acne scars
think it would be safe to use on acne prone skin
i got pimples on my cheeks and near my mouth.
it did nothing for my under eye circles/puffiness
my eyes are itching
including flakiness on my eyelids
acne isn't an issue
very greasy from the get-go and causes breakouts.
i got pimples on my checks
my face is prone to acne
i've noticed that thick creams sometimes cause me to have horrible acne episodes
though i used to have quite severe episodes of over sensitized skin
pick the more clinical/dermatological
in the first application started tingling/burning
the problem area on my face was covered in bumps from a rosacea outbreak
i guess the ingredients help prevent breakouts?
only occasional small breakouts
this product has made my skin start chafing off!
no different in the frequency of my pimple
that the acne got worse ever
did not get rid of the blackheads on my nose
raw skin following other cleansers however this was mild no trouble
even the hyperpigmentation on my face was fading
my biggest skin problem is excess sebum.
it did seem to help a little bit with my acne
i am very oily and acne prone.
it seemed to help with the acne
this product has a burning sensation
for sensitive skin sufferers like me
acne-prone skin not oil or combo acne-prone
i wasn't using this for acne
it did not help to control my acne
it also made my mild acne worse rather than better
effective at getting rid of acne
this definitely did nothing for my acne
didn't work to prevent acne
it hasn't touched the acne that i have
no change in my acne
this has done nothing for fighting/clearing acne
gave me more blackheads
did not help my acne situation
help my small acne spots go away
i didn't notice any help on preventing or treating scars
even toned without a hint of redness
as far as redness goes
does not do much to treat acne
texture or prevent breakouts
chronic acne since adolescence
topical acne treatments do really dry you out
acne prone skin didn't react
as i am constantly trying to find that perfect nonirritating moisturizer for my dry-ish/combination/hormonal acne prone around the chin kind of skin with all of its little white chin bumps
i can honestly say i have seen a reduction in the amount of acne scars i have
redness caused by acne
the product did help reduce acne scars
it does seem to have reduced the redness from my acne
i wouldn't recommend it for anyone with severe acne
this mask caused me to have severe redness
acne like bumps for 4-5 days after use
i noticed that my blackheads were still there
this mask only takes out little to no blackheads
if anything, i got more blackheads.
nothing concerning my blackheads/pores have changed due to this mask
it doesnt do anything for your blackheads
with almost all raving about its success at removing blackheads
given my issues with textured skin/blackheads
was super excited about trying a charcoal mask for blackheads
it didn't take off any blackheads.
it didn't take out any blackheads at all
those little facial hairs
not pull out the blackheads
it did not remove any blackheads or dry skin
it did bring out my blackheads
right after using it there were two blackheads on my chin
it didn't get rid of any blackheads
did not get any gunk out or help with acne.
had major acne breakouts the next day
didn't luminize my skin nor remove any blackheads
you will see your blackheads
each time none of my blackheads appear to be removed when the mask is finished
it did not remove any blackheads for me
without actually removing the blackheads
this stuff gave me pimples on my cheeks
it did not improve any discoloration
after just 4 days of use i have acne on my chin
i never get acne i started using this product
it did not aggravate my acne-prone skin
stopped using my usual skin treatments during that time
i got a bottle of repairwear laser focus wrinkle
currently i have some expression wrinkles on my forehead
some wrinkles around the eye area
decided to start using an anti-aging serum to prevent future wrinkles
seems to have helped with the puffiness if under-eye bags
it does nothing for fine lines or wrinkles
on day 6 i noticed tiny pimples?
well, those pimples spread.
i've never been allergic to any of the creams
i do suffer from adult acne
i also experienced some redness in my cheeks after using as well
did not cause any irritation
set my rosacea to the worst flare i've had in a long time
has something in it that is very irritating to rosacea-prone skin
this was recommended to me after expressing my concerns for my acne prone face
had 4 pimples on my face
does not prevent new wrinkles.
now i have far more redness
i never get acne, ever.
dryness around my eyes
my skin was irritated with mild burning
my skin is not typically sensitive to creams
atopic skin at age 63
occasionally acne prone with some hyper-pigmentation
i didn't notice any decrease in the appearance of wrinkles on my face or forehead
my skin is not sensitive to breaking out or acne prone at all
i never had acne or breakouts ever!
wrinkles around my eyes
i now have an eye infection
it did not get rid of puffiness i had, either.
does not take away any discoloration
it totally gives the same affect as botox
rate it a 5 star as it does make the puffiness disappear
the wrinkles are back
my wrinkles were accentuated
don't have much damage or wrinkles yet
the wrinkles were gone
my wrinkles reappeared instantly
it does seem to improve or lessen the deep wrinkles or creases on my face
acne prone in some areas
...it triggered a rosacea flare.
this caused the tiny rosacea bumps that are the bane of my existence
there were a lot more pimples on my skin
it pills on my face
the cream caused my skin to have an allergic reaction
doesn't help a lot with puffiness.
my puffy eyes are more due to allergy conditions.
it got rid of some of the puffiness
did nothing to reduce under eye puffiness
i've tried so many different eye creams for puffiness
i got this for the occasional udder eye puffiness
have never had an adverse reaction to eye creams/gels before
however it doesn't reduce puffiness as much as i would like
this product did not have any effect on my under eye puffiness
my eye-puffiness is definitely lessened by its use
i don't see much difference in my under eye puffiness
i dont see any decrease in puffiness under the eyes with this
still need botox for the crows feet however.
it does work on reducing puffiness
there is a visible difference in puffiness
i also suffer from perioral dermatitis
i never get acne
this product gave me some nasty breakouts
acne flare-ups after using this
i actually had an allergic reaction to it.
helped with my undereye puffiness
along with my normal skin care routine
doesn't do anything for dark circles or puffiness
i tried waiting a few mites
cause cumulative dehydration to both skin
caused some red pimples
i also had redness
an allergic reaction to it
also a zit had formed
my skin looked blotchy
didn't seem to improve puffiness or anything noticeable
this product did not reduce puffiness at all
i've tried plenty of eye creams
not for the acne prone or fragrance sensitive.
it made my face itch, and caused breakout.
such as fine lines/wrinkles
eventually causes wrinkles over time
and now i have to deal with my oiliness.
while i dont have visible wrinkles
i suspected it was actually causing more pimples
experienced more whiteheads in those areas
the only thing that it has done is reduced the redness around my nose
didn't notice any improvement in the appearance of my blackheads/pores
it gave my acne prone skin a very oily feeling.
i continued to experience some skin irritation
i've had a few post-acne blemishes that are being stubborn
went for this superstar wrinkle reducer after recently having cosmetically altered my wrinkles with botox
look for local deals on dermal fillers
don't have bad wrinkles
chin after not having any breakouts in months
occasionally some products may irritate my skin
people with "sensitive skin" had a problem with this serum
helps my skin especially since i use retin a
if you are acne prone
still suffer the occasional breakouts
it is causing problems with my skin
- did not reduce puffiness
it did help a bit with puffiness
minimizing the appearance of fine line/wrinkles
puffiness under my eyes
each time the same flare up of extreme dryness occurs
some mild steroid cream to calm it down again
it may have helped just very slightly with puffiness
this product did reduce the look of wrinkles under my eye
i don't have puffiness as a concern
also has a tendency to cause some eye irritation
this will help camouflage wrinkles by temporarily tightening the skin
following with an eye cream does help with the flakiness
well it made the puffiness under my eyes disappear
or if i washed it off as directed the puffiness re-appeared
does nothing for puffiness
puffiness under my eyes
wrinkling apparent at the crows feet area from the stiffness of the product
with acne prone skin.
its always my go to primer for enlarged pores or acne scarring minimizing
i don't have breakouts
my acne has never been worse
gave me awful breakouts
i went from having clear skin to huge pimples
doesn't cause blemishes or breakouts
i stopped and the acne cleared right up.
under the skin pimples
almost looked like a ton of blackheads
never had pimples using any type of skin care.
still i never had this much pimples so often
which can aggravate sensitive skin
do not use if you are acne prone.
what i really hate about this facial cream is the greasiness
there are other eye creams that combine better treatment
"signs of age or stress"
nothing for puffiness, lines, or dark circles.
it made my eyes itchy
did absolutely nothing to improve signs of aging or puffiness
my wrinkles weren't severe.
it has not helped me with puffiness
i do not have dark circles / puffiness
don’t’ really have wrinkles- using it as a preventative
it did absolutely nothing to help my facial redness
this didn't do anything for my redness
it really doesn't help with redness very much
i didn't notice much difference with my redness
it does however help with redness.
didn't do anything for the redness
the pimples are like acne
my face had splotches resembling a "bad" sunburn
could be another sign of my allergy
it irritated my undereye area.
i really don't want to clutter counter with two different eye creams
it does help a little with any puffiness i had when i woke up
i don't think it doesn't much to help redness or puffiness either
no visible anti aging effects
not one fighting a hangover
because i have had issues with eye creams before
my blackheads are a little worse for using it
did not cause any irritation
not good for sunspots
it has caused horrible horrible horrible breakouts
i never get acne
i've never had this type of breakouts
not to great dealing with puffiness!
gave me a terrible allergy attacks
unfortunately it caused acne to form on the side of her face
the product caused a lot of irritation under my eyes
had no eye irritation
this time of year allergies make it dry
it made my eyes itch
my primary concern is dryness under my eyes
does little for puffiness or darkcircles
she has dry skin and a little acne .
it is too strong for facial treatments
i am not prone to breakouts
my eyes are dry and very allergy prone.
itch or make my skin dry
skin irritants are known to accelerate the aging process
at first i thought maybe the redness is normal
because of this redness it also made my skin very itchy
after using it for a long period of time it did not work to remove/fade any of the acne scars or hyperpigmentation
this product did not reverse the appearance of dark spot or discolorations
a cast member directed me to this product to help diminish dark spots without the risk of hydroquinone
she mentioned that hydroquinone could make deeper skin look blotchy
its hard to get rid of acne scar marks when youre getting more acne
rather than help my acne
if it's not actually making the acne worse
the worst part is that is triggered major acne
the murad rapid age spot treatment might be a better choice if you are using this product for hyperpigmentation
started noticing redness in the areas i was using it
i figured i could cover the redness up in the meantime
besides the hyper-pigmentation i have on my cheeks
this product did nothing to lighten or brighten my sunspots
this just caused breakouts near the acne scars i applied to
give my face acne
saw no improvement in my acne or skin tone
irritated my skin significantly
my acne is hormonal
did not cause any breakouts
the rep at sephora said it would help with the acne
if i wasn't concerned with clearing up my acne
of anti-aging facial products
my acne was under control prior to its use.
it gave me consistent acne
lingered like nobody's business in the hormonal spots
the next morning i had two pimples
i've noticed some breakouts with it
if you're past your acne years
i ended up with 3 pimples on my chin in the morning
my skin has been especially dry due to retinol use
the intense fragrance started triggering migraines
i also am very acne prone
it doesn't heal my acne scars any faster than normal
i tried to look past the breakouts
i started to notice an allergic reaction in the form of a patch of dry skin on my neck
has been suffering from acne
easily irritated or breakout prone skin
my face is actually peeling like i have a sunburn
i started getting a ton of blackheads
never in my life have i had blackheads
the blackheads all cleared up
didn't irritate my skin
not so much with the puffiness
it does not help with my puffiness at all
my main issue is dark circles from allergies
it itched my skin
normal sometimes combo skin
there's no redness or burning
not for rosacea skin
i noticed that i was getting pretty bad large pimple kind of acne all over my chin
don't buy this if you have acne prone skin!
does not help my acne either
it didn't harm my skin
this didn't help any of my acne.
i never saw a difference in my zits
it's great at reducing pimples
the zits are just as red
my pimple stay the same size
i put it on a new pimple overnight
it does shrink my pimples
i do get some pimples from stress or hormones
it also hasn't helped get rid of spot pimples very well either
my skin is not dry or acne prone
i would rather have a pimple for a week than a nasty dry scab
i applied it to a hormonal pimple for 5 days twice a day as directed
actually increased the redness
the main type of acne i suffer from is r
i noticed some decrease in redness if i put some on a new pimple
did not eliminate acne spots as advertised
it made my acne worsen
sticking to tea tree oil for acne
a girl a sephora recommended this for my sensitive acne prone combination skin
my acne is still there
this does nothing to help diminish redness or to reduce pimples
i only use it with big problem pimples.
my pimple has not healed.
have even had new pimples emerge by the mornings
it does not make the pimple disappear overnight
i wanted something gentle which would help with acne
the only thing it did was reduce the redness in my acne
it did not reduce redness or pimple size
more of a mild acne so this is not for acne
it is more for random pimples that come up.
while this didn't help me in reducing an occasional pimple or breakout
it made my skin itchy
this product causes a skin allergy reaction
had terrible acne which i had to return asap
as for my acne
i get blemishes on my jaw line
hadn't experience breakouts in a long time
those pimples that are big
i don't typically get acne
it also made my skin flake from dryness.
caused my skin to be dry
it does not claim to help with acne
didn't help with blackheads at all
i noticed most of my blackheads were gone
combination skin which is acne prone
i've never seen a change in blackheads after using it
it did not clear out pores / blackheads
when i took the picture i still had blackheads
it did get some of my blackheads out
i get maybe one or 2 super annoying blackheads a month
it might have actually made my blackheads worse!
not once has it cleared my blackheads
can't speak for effectiveness against puffiness or dark circles
acne on my eyelids
made my eyes itch!!!
in fact that the skin was flaking
it causes my eyeliner
didn't notice my acne reduce at all
it doesn't really help with acne
it am prone to breakouts
it's no longer really working for my acne
i don't have acne
lots of redness all over my chin
jumped to this cleanser after getting no acne clearing results from the shiseido
it is effective against my adult acne
it did nothing for my rosacea or fine lines.
cons: salicylic acid only treats certain kinds of breakouts
did not work on inflammatory acne.
btw i have oily skin and acne prone skin.
i didnt seen improvement in acne
dryness around my mouth
the mask gave me breakouts avery time i used it
each of them turn out allergies
it causes me allergies every single time.
my skin is oily and dry and have acne.
leaves behind a little redness
red acne scars all over my face
caused an increased number of blackheads to break out in my t-zone
it is known to be really bad for acne prone skin
face acne has cleared up
i honestly don't find that this mask did much as a spot treatment for blemishes or acne
i woke up with 15-20 whiteheads all over my forehead
bring down the redness
does not help with acne at all.
it's helps with some acne issues overtime
give me more acne
it didn't seem to speed healing of breakouts
the claimed effects on reducing redness
the redness did go away
the acne not so much
would only recommend if you need something to reduce the redness quickly
have acne flare ups every few weeks
however, it did nothing for my acne.
tried this for my acne prone teenage son's skin
he has drier skin with acne so someone who is prone to dryness would need a more moisturizing formula
i discovered that some of the ingredients are irritants to the skin
didn't clog my pores nor did it give me acne.
also caused a few pimples
absolutely a excellent product with people with acne prone skin
acne prone skin so the promise of helping with that was very enticing
this product made me breakout around my hairline
the under eye wrinkles are appearing
many eye treatments i've tried make my eyes water
sustained reduction or dimishment of wrinkles
it also gave me terrible blackheads
he does not have sensitive combo acne prone skin like i do
i woke up with new pimples
i've never had acne issues to begin with
that it did not seem to aggravate my acne
after that, my eyelids became very dry and itchy.
i even used it with an eye cream to lessen the dryness
i started to get pimples on my upper eyelids
now one that will help with extreme dryness
this product also does not cause irritation
i started getting chapped eyelids
did absolutely nothing my wrinkles
afraid it will never replace eyelid surgery
it didn't do anything for eye wrinkles
i do not notice any difference in the sagginess of my eyelids or my undereye puffiness
this product is not useful to someone with aging eyelids
including helping to fade acne spots
i gave it to my roommate to use who has severe acne
it was highly recommended for oily or combination skin that's acne prone
after 2 uses it was as though i had more pimples than face
in my nose its have blackheads
being desperate to have something help with my acne
for someone with acne
its reputed abilities to transform adult acne prone skin
safe for my sensitive/allergy prone skin
need a serious antiaging product
hasn't caused any irritations or breakouts
if you are at all acne prone or sensitive
unless this product is supposed to help you cultivate a face full of pimples then this cream deserves 25 stars one for each zit
could use some help with puffiness
this product does not decrease puffiness right away like other products i have tried
made my eyes itchy
i am not "acne prone"
i normally buy combo or dry skin products because the dryness is more severe than the oiliness
helped a little with redness
due my acne medication
however i have acne prone skin
i am also acne prone.
however i started having allergic reactions to the product
i love this nighttime facial !
the day after trying it i broke out in dermatitis
itchy skin after use
i still have blemishes
it sinus when i apply
the main reason i baught it was to brighten up old acne marks
this mask caused a breakout
unfortunately this caused small pimples on my forehead
i got pimples all over my face
did nothing for long term wrinkles
caused blackheads after 3 days
a few whiteheads popping up
contact with the skin
i did not expect skin aggravation and breakouts.
i can't report any softening of fine lines or wrinkles
don't have any major wrinkles
no wrinkles have disappeared
i don't even have the "deep" wrinkles that this serum is supposed to treat
prescribed by dermatologist to heal my face skin
from old acne scars
this serum definitely helped control my oiliness throughout the day
it seems to help with my moderate acne
this balm did absolutely nothing for my fine lines or puffiness
i didn't feel it helped with puffiness under my eyes
it does help with the puffiness.
this caused a burning sensation
this had no effect on my undereye puffiness
it works, improves puffiness up to 80% for me
it does slightly reduce puffiness
i don't notice any difference in puffiness
i didn't see any results on reducing puffiness.
the reviews i read before purchasing said it reduced puffiness
after this i have to use some hardcore treatments around eyes to help dry skin
the product itself does a decent job of alleviating puffiness
redness around the eyes
it really did nothing for puffiness or dark circles
this really feels good with or without puffiness
i did not notice any decrease in the puffiness of my eyes
some results on hyperpigmentation
not much for wrinkles or redness
reducing puffiness or "reviving tired eyes"
did nothing for puffiness, circles, etc.
i got a pimple after using it once
i am not acne prone
i don't have any wrinkles on my face
if i use it everyday i find it aggravates my acne
i also needed it to help with puffiness
it doesn't remove stubborn blackheads
- you can use it as a spot treatment/overnight acne fixer
i do sometimes get acne breakouts
i got this to combat blackheads.
but when i removed it i still had blackheads.
i switched to this "lotion" version after having a freaky acne breakout brought on by stress
i started to have oiliness with the acne
made my acne much worse
my acne is already getting better after 2 days
i've had acne skin since middle school
get acne marks easily
while i may be seeing some redness reduction right now
i am 31 with very oily skin prone to breakouts all the while battling wrinkles
s helps with dryness
dryness in the winter
it got rid of the redness she had on her face
i believe it has been helping her acne prone skin :
this product cleared up some of my pimples
after one use i broke out with about 9 pimples on my forehead
it gave my face an unpleasant tingling sensation
my acne scars never faded
i've never suffered from acne
every time i use i have breakouts all over my skin
there from previous acne
it didn't help with discolouration
my discoloration did fade a bit
helped fade some hyperpigmentation i had around my mouth
i never have breakouts
causes good skin to look horrible
didn't clear up my breakouts or prevent more
i still got my hormonal break out
it also didn't help with my redness
or breakouts at all
not strong enough for acne scars
even with the "flash facial" with the good genes
redness all over my face
whiteheads are still appearing
the redness has not subsided
i breakout with big red pimples the morning after use
greasiness would lead to breakouts again
i just saw it said retinoid
had a few pimples in the morning
by giving me breakouts i look like a tween going through puberty all over again
i don't have really deep wrinkles
have normal skin that's not prone to acne
it would minimize the wrinkles a bit on application
minimize any of my wrinkles
i doesn't minimize wrinkles
i wanted a daily serum to eventually reduce the wrinkles not just cover them
i didn't expect miracles for my deep wrinkles
this did not appear to reduce wrinkles on my forehead or laugh lines
still no change in facial wrinkles
especially for those with acne
have not seen decrease in forhead wrinkles
or upper lip wrinkles
this did nothing to help with my acne
i struggle with various forms of acne
my acne did however somewhat diminish
doesn't do much for acne
i experienced some breakouts
if you don't have acne
have acne it is equivalent to using water as a spot treatment
i don't see it treating my acne.
am prone to acne on my forehead
it worked at clearing up some minor breakouts
the acne-treating part stopped
this system would probably work better for teenage skin or someone with very mild acne
if you're experiencing adult acne
over the years i have struggled with acne.
which resulted in a serious acne flair up
i personally am not prone to acne
i do struggle with breakouts
i am very acne prone
my skin is very acne-prone
it seems to prevent breakouts
began burning with irritation
this caused a lot of bumps and acne on my face.
it does help clear up breakouts.
though it would help with the acne
i've had adult acne since 2005
yes it does decrease acne breakouts
sometimes i need a treatment for acne
it only made breakouts worse
this product didn't help with my hormonal pimples at all
it also didn't help with the active pimples
if only it had helped with my pimples
most of my pimples had practically disappeared
only overnight acne treatment i have ever bought that made my skin feel oilier
it also didn't help dry out any of the pimples on my face
i don't have serious acne
it actually made my pimples bigger
and it gave me more whiteheads.
don't normally get acne except once a month
stops zits from getting bigger
did not help my acne prone skin
not a good product if u have acne prone skin
using a drying acne treatment
the redness in my face evened out
it burned my dry/acne skin
i tried out this product after it was confirmed that the source of my acne was my skin's dryness
also don't want acne
might have reduced puffiness
i didn't notice any decrease in puffiness
didn't see a difference in my under eye puffiness after using
i don't have allergies
the mask didn't really make much of a difference with the puffiness
while i don't have many wrinkles
i gave it 3 stars only because it didn't help as much with puffiness
they do not smell like the ptr acne line
i still got bad breakouts.
my acne scars don't look less pigmented.
my blackheads and whiteheads are still there.
the post-blemishes redness still there after they're gone
it did not help my acne or my post acne spots.
rarely if ever experience breakouts
wanted a few blackheads to go for good
normally never use "acne" treatments
made my current pimples worse
when i was finished my mild acne was now intense
she was surprised that anyone had recommend this product to me because it is not meant for mild or hormonal acne
don't purchase this product if you have mild acne
i still have some whiteheads
i don't have acne
just some breakouts every now
i've used everything to control my adult acne
this does not work on hormonal acne, just fyi.
with noticeable spots of hyperpigmentation.
then my hormonal acne came back with a vengeance
i still get the same amount of zits
my blackheads are still there as well
i've used the acne gel for years
i'd say it's good for acne marks
as far as preventing new pimples--didn't even make a dent
this moisturizer has caused no reactions/breakouts
ed to breakouts that i am already dealing with
which is a known skin irritant
suffered a bad reaction (redness burning, etc.)
it helped some of my breakouts heal faster
it smells pretty much like an acne medication
my dryness has improved a bit.
this serum even caused dryness on my forehead which never happens
in fact, it causes irritation.
got this in hopes it would help with my redness.
it doesn't diminish my redness or make my skin particularly soft
this is the first facial serum that creates pimples on my face within hours after application
they are very occlusive
this serum is not for you if you're dealing with acne breakouts
can be sensitive with tendency towards redness
while this did not encourage more redness in my skin
it did not calm the redness in my skin
it didn't irritate my skin
people with acne prone skin, beware!
my skin was super red, like i had a sunburn.
it didn't soothe or help with redness
background info: i'm 21 with acne prone skin
on prescribed acne topicals
maybe because i have sensitive acne prone skin who knows
after a few days i did get some pimples
when you have acne problems
acne prone skin happy
it keeps my redness at bay
this was recommended to help with my skin redness
for those with normal skin
did nothing for the puffiness.
it didn't seem to minimize puffiness or correct the color of the skin under the eyes
the only thing it did was maybe soothe any puffiness
like i am suffering from bad allergies
does not cause my allergies to act up
so do my wrinkles
the only two great thing about it are that it reduces puffiness from crying
helps with the puffiness in the morning
even some relief from puffiness
t will reduce some puffiness
it made my undereyes itch
i don't feel it helped much with puffiness
this oil unfortunately led to a few breakouts
caused breakouts on my sensitive dry skin.
this stuff has been my holy grail for helping heal my hormonal acne
this oil helped calm the itchiness
it doesn't help for acne or to uneven skin.
when i initially went to the store seeking a moisturizer that would provider revitalize my extremely sensitive/acne-prone skin without clogging pores like so many others have
i don't even get that much acne
if your face is even the tiniest bit acne-prone
hyperpigmentation i've been battling all through my 30s
it did not improve hyper pigmentation even slightly
my acne scars are not fading away.
which is very rare since my skin is very acne-prone
the acne on my forhead has reduced somewhat
the dark scars left by previous pimples have not been lightened
i saw no reduction in pigmentation
no reduction in zit appearances
need to start balancing an acne prone t zone
thinking about aging skin
would be great for my acne
10/10 would not recommend for acne sufferers.
i wanted this to fade my hyper pigmentation
however, it did keep my acne under control.
wanted it for my hyper pigmentation
it kept my acne under control.
have developed pimples on my cheeks
if the zits persist
perhaps it was an allergic reaction
it causes more breakouts
t overnight resurfacing serum as it helps with breakouts so much better than this product does
my acne scars are exactly the same
i first bought a travel size to see how it would work my acne blemishes
over time i saw a little difference about the pigmentation of my blemishes
i tried spot treatment on my big bumpy pimples
made the redness worst
i only use this product on scars/blemishes now.
as a mask or a spot treatment
it has help my skin as far as a breakouts in certains spots
when i first bought it this product was effective in removing my acne to where my face was smooth with just a lot of acne scars
you will have your pimples come to a head
as well as intermittent bouts of acne
once i applied this to my breakouts
its has helped a bit with my acne
not as dramatically as an acne free sulfur mask that a used years ago
i now have more acne prone skin with enlarged pores
that recommend me this product for my acne prone skin with full knowledge that i had dry sensitive skin
not only did it not help reduce acne
while simultaneously giving my acne of a kind
deep pimples on my forehead
did not help iwth me acne on my combo skin
i don't have bad acne
not with my acne
this mask does calm my acne a bit
this product has not helped clear blackheads as i expected
it definitely does not work for spot treating acne
i developed 1-2 pimples the very next day
fyi: my skin type is combination that suffers from hormonal
breakouts along my jawline
it isn't a product that does much for acne
sulfur is often used for hormonal outbreaks
i am acne prone/oily
i just have a highly sensitivity to the main irritants in skin care products
helped lighten up new/old acne scares along with reducing the amount of dark spot/freckles
not better or worse than other creams
as a person with dryness
doesn't irritate my acne-prone skin
i also agree with another reviewer who stated that it helps calm down redness
this took away the dry patches around my mouth/chin without giving me any whiteheads or breakouts
now my face has small pimples
caused me to break out in little pimples all over my face
sensitive skin with redness
i've got sensitive, oily skin with rosacea.
along with a few pimples
almost like mini acne
it really helped reduce my acne
not even with the dryness.
to the point of aggravating the skin
i contacted a member of their staff asking if this treatment could address the discoloration of my pores
do i really think this will make a difference in the discoloration when even my dermatologist is out of ideas?
flake as if i had a sunburn
do not buy if you have acne prone skin
this is not tingling it's burning.
heal irritated or raw skin from blemishes
while i have normal skin
it also gave my skin more of a burning sensation than a "tingling" one
dryness around my eye area
my puffiness is unchanged
i've had puffy eyes due to allergies
light moisturizer for acne-prone skin
i noticed that the facial treatment essence really helps reduce redness
has not yet irritated my sensitive/ acne prone skin
i only gave a 3 because i did have some redness
because my skin is prone to breakouts with heavy oily products i had breakouts
did get a few breakouts
if it causes increased sun sensitivity
have yet to find anything that fades my acne scars
it didn't help my acne
my acne finally healed
this moisturizer immediately calms the redness on my newly healed acne scar
i'll just wait till my skin heals for the redness to be gone
for those of u like me suffering from adult acne with sensitive dry skin
have flaky skin on acne
freckles from the sun as well
it actually started brightening my freckles on my nose
have all the puffiness
slight difference in my under eye wrinkles
didn't see any results except the zit!
i noticed wrinkles under my eyes
it did nothing for my eye puffiness or otherwise.
didn't prevent any breakouts
the redness wouldn't come off
like a very bad sunburn
my face burns horrible
almost like i had sunburn where the mask had been
which is a drying alcohol that will actually cause wrinkles
the hunt continues for a moisturizer that controls redness
i ended up having a few pimples pop up
which i never have acne issues
it caused major breakouts for 5 weeks
fixed my dry skin problem
i woke up with a pimple
this didnt help reduce my scars
i also rarely get pimples
i noticed blackheads on my nose
have noticed no change to wrinkles or redness
i didn't have issue with redness
i think i am allergic to this product since it made the skin around my eye all red
at my age, i do not need any extra puffiness.
sometimes get hormonal acne
my skin is not acne-prone
i rarely gets breakouts
i got pretty bad acne
this product made the teen youth of acne come out all over my face
oily acne prone skin with some dryness
i currently have 3-5 pimples on each cheek
i don't have acne prone skin
also my forehead broke out with a few pimples.
i constantly have little pimples around my chin
usually acne prone skin that is on the normal side
then i found out that although retinol or retinoids can be good for the rest of your face
can make you more susceptible to wrinkles
about a week after using this stuff i also had a bad eye infection
no reduction in puffiness or dark circles
am predisposed to under eye wrinkles
i too experienced a burning sensation when i applied this cream
i find that each time i apply this my eyelids experience a burning sensation
possibly too high a retinoid for my skin.
never has any skincare product irritated my skin until this eye cream
as i have noticed some dark spots forming under my eyes because retinol causes extra sun sensitivity
i wasn't going to live on allergy pills just to use an eye cream
puffiness around my eyes
non-irritating eye cream
i don't see any beneficial effects from the retinoids
i don't have crows feet or wrinkles
i also thought retinol was supposed to help with wrinkles
used philosophy's miraculous anti-aging retinoid eye repair cream
don't have to have eye surgery
actually made the puffiness worse
i am either allergic to them
got this product for my acne scars that i've had for years
my conclusion is that it tones down redness
doesn't really work on acne scars that have been there a while
i still have some left over scarring on my cheeks
used it for a year -- no results on red acne scars / new + old
e to breakouts/congestion under the surface
will continue to treat old scars
avoid areas with active acne/breakouts
i really don't see any difference in diminishing the acne scars i have on my chin
night on my acne scars thinking it would be my hg
this has made the texture of the scar worse
92% of users had decreased scar thickness after eight weeks:
have acne scars as well
tested it on my knee's scar
have allergic reaction to it :
it seemed kind of counterproductive to usea product to clean up scars from former acne with a product that just gave me more
been using on two scars.
one a recent scar and one an old scar.
ended up asking about treatments for my acne scars
i applied some on my scars
at the same time i was using my sirius aurora light therapy system which also gets rid of scarring
acne-prone skin my entire life
however it does reduce the appearance of acne scars slightly after 3 weeks
my skib did not react well to the retinol
i really loved the acne treatment that kate somerville has
acne combo that i have
it seems to do a fair job of minimizing wrinkles
also , give me many acnes.
never have an acne at all.
that sometimes retinol takes a while to work
by the fourth application i experienced severe irritation
my skin was flaking by the end of week 2
because it seemed to calm down the redness
it didn't help with breakouts
it really reduces the redness in my skin
the redness reduction has been so dramatic
which is where my acne is the worst
i ordered this because reviewers stated that it would be great for oily acne prone skin
which is acne prone
this gel caused irritation/redness on my skin
the redness no longer is an issue
the only improvement i see is that my blackheads are smaller
i also had a few pimples come out which i chalked up to my product trials
really shrink my pores after 2 pregnancies
may be better for someone with severe blocked pores
the orange label has discoloration
my skin around my eyes are flaking
i felt only a very slight burning sensation from the retinol
because of ravings over the wonders of retinol for reducing wrinkles
heard i would need to ease my skin into using retinol
started to notice increased puffiness
more puffy, creapy, and my wrinkles were deeper!!
even my algenist eye cream couldn't overcome the drying caused by this serum
maybe the retinol content was just too low to effect my skin
as i've read that retinol tends to take up to 12 weeks to show results
in the meantime i have to moisturize constantly so the wrinkles caused by the dryness are less obvious
i don't see any difference in puffiness
i don't have issues with milia.
does have an instant lighting effect because of the pigmentation
look into other under eye treatments
possibly the start of milia
hardly having any melanin there
for sure helps with any puffiness i have that morning
not only was i starting to get wrinkles
battled with adult acne
my acne is non existent
t help with any dark circles or puffiness
don't have under eye wrinkles yet
this new product made my eyelids puffy
irritated my skin and made face itchy.
it caused severe dryness
it didn't actually reduce puffiness
it's done nothing for my under eye wrinkles
dryness under my eyes
it aggravates my rosacea
blackheads which i've never had before
my skin was blotchy, burning, and red.
perhaps i have a rare allergic reaction.
combined with my allergies
it made more blackheads appear
i no longer have acne
already had three pimple form on my face
it's also acne prone
these breakouts were on my cheeks
i never get acne anywhere on my face other than some hormonal acne on my chin
as it does cause irritation
i don't get pimples.
my hyperpigmentation marks come from stupid stuff like scratching myself in my sleep with my nails
my acne grows more
my jawline breakouts went away
in places i never get zits
this product has lavender oil which if used frequently on the skin over time gives you wrinkles
caused redness -- much better results with origins checks
within 2 days i was harvesting blackheads
i developed acne breakouts along both sides of my face
not too oily to cause pimples
it caused my rosacea to flare up on my chin
the sales person recommended this product for my sensitive skin prone to redness
irritated my skin to the point of redness
not least i started having small pimples
i didn't have any issues with dryness before
i ended up going to a dermatologist
i didn't even have breakouts as a teen
this product always causes breakouts
be cautious of you have sensitive/acne prone skin
it would correct the dryness
it also causes some minor irritation when you use it daily on sensitive skin
did nothing for puffiness
it did nothing for my under eye wrinkles
my wrinkles are still there
caused my acne-prone skin to break out
i very rarely have reactions to face creams
the irritations ceased as soon as i switched creams
caused puffiness under my eyes
it wasn't especially worse than other self-tanners i've tried
one problem, bumps all over and acne.
f you are acne prone just be cautious
while this didn't irritate my sensitive skin or cause breakouts
s of dollars to get rid of my acne
i never have pimples
i don't think it helps with puffiness
pimples after using it
effects on my skin
it had a tendency to pill off when applying foundation
this dried out my skin so bad i had flakes of skin like i had a sunburn
believe there's something in this product that clogs my pores enough that the retinol can't clear up the blemishes
the texture of the product bothersome
also when i wake up i have zits!
they didn't seem like pimples at first
because i get dry skin from acne
experienced the same burning sensation
am not acne-prone
acne prone skin i decided to stop using it
the whiteheads stopped emerging
my now-existing acne began to heal
with the severity of the breakouts
i just started to get some acne around my lip area
i started to breakout with tiny whiteheads on my forehead
i wouldn't recommend for acne-prone skin
it doesn't work well with my acne prone skin
acne after just one use
this does not cause any irritation or breakouts
it caused me skin issues
it made my wrinkles disappear
because i only put the serum on my wrinkles
the pimples occurred only on the places where i had placed the serum
just got botox for my wrinkles
erasing marks or reducing acne
although i have outgrown most of my acne
i started to notice lots of pimples particularly on my cheeks
once i stopped the acne stopped.
not recommended for oily or acne prone skin
who's going to notice wrinkles when you have a bunch of pimples?
also caused me numerous breakouts after having clear skin for a while
i just can't deal with the pimples
my skin is full of acne something unusual in my skin
now noticed wrinkles on my forehead
it doesn't fix wrinkles.
i noticed after prolonged use that i did some breakouts around my jawline etc
don't have any problems with acne or texture
had an allergic reaction to it
looked like a bad sunburn
breakouts actually look worse
no acne no scars just large pores on my nose
i've never had bumps or acne or any other types of skin problems
it's doesn't give me a glow or help with my hormonal breakouts
my pregnancy skin could be to blame
pregnancy hormones are likely the culprit
who prognosticated to me that i will have rosacea because i have few broken capillaries barely noticeable in my face
broken capillaries doesn't mean i will have rosacea
still have a lot of breakouts
stop making skin care
my skin is acne prone so this made it worse.
occasionally have acne if the product i use is too oily
it didn't reduce my puffiness at all
it caused acne instead.
itchy skin under my eyebrows
does nothing at all for puffiness or bags.
this product does nothing to get rid of under eye puffiness
the puffiness doesn't appear to be going down
didn't really notice a difference in the puffiness
it did nothing to relieve the puffiness under my eyes
it doesn't do much for dark circles or puffiness
i hoped that this would reduce allergy induced puffiness
the product seems to do a good job of reducing my puffiness
did absolutely nothing for reducing puffiness under my eyes
i do not have a major problem with puffiness
i hardly get breakouts
i don't have a lot of acne
never had more than the occassional pimple
definitely never had an acne problem.
it contains ingredients that cause acne.
tiny pimples all over as the result of this
probably not for breakout prone skin.
blemishes disappeared immediately after discontinued use
i started getting more blackhead
i noticed nothing new with my facial skin
have oily or acne prone skin to use this product
acne prior to using this product
it didn't irritate my skin
my blackheads have stopped showing up so much
ed those problems to "my skin"
usually i get breakouts when spf is mixed in
i don't have any fine lines or wrinkles
it did not dramatically reduce my dark circles or puffiness
this product increased my eye puffiness markedly
instantly noticed a weird puffy feeling as if i had allergies
while this eye cream definitely got rid of puffiness
really helps moisturize my eyes when i have dry areas due to my allergies
it did nothing for my acne
my acne disappeared very quickly!!
i would not recommend this to anyone with acne or sensitive skin
got two pimples on my face
my skin is very acne prone
it helps my acne
this bio-chemical retinol is the worst nightmare my skin had to endure
since i started using it i've had more pimples than usual
spot-concealer over minimal scarring
which causes more wrinkles
i ended up with a lot of redness after using this
i've noticed that products which contain grape seem to anger my skin
after my facial injections
this made me feel so oily i don't have acne prone skin
ive never had major issues with acne
clogs my pores like crazy /: i never had a problem with acne
also not very kind on my acne prone face.
like increased blemishes or oiliness
light moisturizer that has soothed my skin of noticeable redness
i usually have very few pimples
the result was a few breakouts
i almost never have any pimples
can't say it helps the morning puffiness.
i've also noticed that i get whiteheads with it as well
is it because my skin is immune to it
after my pimple healed
stopped hurting i started getting the left over acne scar
as suggested by dermatologists
after using this product i got horrible breakouts on my forehead
breakouts on my forehead
it also caused breakouts
noticeable acne scarring on my cheeks
calming a little redness after cleansing
i still have oiliness
however the formulation caused pilling on my skin
it doesn't treat the acne that i have
i didn't notice any reduction in pores or wrinkles
dark big pimples all over my cheeks and temples.
i still can't rid the acne
there are 6-7 zits total just on the cheeks.
made my breakouts worse
it doesn't give breakouts or any adverse effects to my sensitive skin
i generally love shiseido's hair products
breakouts aren't any different
i even had a couple of breakouts on my forehead
caused even more breakouts
however the 3 star rating is because it didnt correct the appearance of unevenness i had in my skin or help with the pores or breakouts or acne marks
i wasn't having pustule acne
lower cheeks broke out in pustule acne
made my breakouts much worse
depending on the severity of your acne
that didn't really matter much to me because my hormonal acne problem persisted
this product did not help or seem to prevent acne
i say if you have small acne blemishes
for bigger acne problems
make an appointment with your dermatologist
made my face itch all night
they didn't eliminate my "acne"
haven't noticed any changes in the acne or rosacea on my cheeks
i tried using this to help with the few bits of hormonal acne i would get around my menstrual cycle
there are more gentle ways to get rid of acne ladies
i didn't notice too much acne reduction.
dry the pimple out
i also notice that the hyper pigmentation from past acne breakouts on my right cheek is slowly starting to fade
experienced a very unusual breakout along the jawline
which is notoriously bad for acne-prone skin
seemed to cause more blackheads
ater two days i had horrible acne.
broken out with acne like i've never experienced before
my skin is only starting to heal
did help with discolorations.
my skin became itchy
have not only more wrinkles
i've tried dozens of under-eye creams
i do not have wrinkles.
i think the retinol concentration is too much for those with sensitive skin
it hasn't helped with fine lines or wrinkles
no issues with breakouts or white bumps appearing like eye creams can tend to do
this did nothing to lighten my hyperpigmentation.
i found that this product helped prevent my skin from more dark spots caused by acne
selected the version that specifically noted that addressed old acne scars
right now they look like freckles
maybe it's because i don't have acne scars or any major discolorations
my skin is very good to me with pimples
my skin was doing really well until i gave this a whirl for my hyperpigmentation
usually just a pimple or two
acne spots or what so ever
my forehead became covered with acne
an area i never have acne on
there is no improvement in either dark spots or areas of redness
it caused more acne marks then it corrected
it doesn't really change any pigmentation or dark spots
it might even be the cause of some acne
turned out to cause extreme redness
especially because i hormonally breakout.
recently got a decent sunburn on my face
take away redness from any irritation
i think it helped open up my sinuses which helped a lot
i do not ever get pimples
helps with some of the redness
no reduction in redness, no softer skin.
get rid of some of the redness/blotchiness on my face
it didn't irritate my skin
seasonal skin that also has acne flare-ups
with the beginnings of rosacea on my nose
helped to reduce redness after an intense enzyme peel
i am on accutane right now for my acne as my skin is dry
easly to break out face with blackheads from time to time
while i still get some acne
i am more prone to rosacea "breakouts
breakouts around my nose
new pimples cropped up
i also believe this is causing some breakouts.
some small pimples popping up
left my dry skin itchy and read.
i never have breakouts on my chin
then to make matters worse it caused mild breakouts in my chin
the ingredients caused redness
which can cause irritation on sensitive skin
i'll stick to one without the irritants
this product caused nasty breakouts around my chin
it had been working pretty well without causing me redness or flaking
help prevent the occasions forehead blemish
not for sensitive, dry, acne prone skin.
not recommend for some one with acne prone skin like me
luckily no breakouts or pores
didn't really help in acne scarring for me.
i noticed that the moisturizer left my cheeks with redness
skin even started flaking.
i usually have mild
acne on my chin area
didn't help with my breakouts
it does nothing for lines and wrinkles.
maybe if i had dry skin or wrinkles
i've never had this problem with other eye creams
on "bad" days the puffiness is still not diminished
i don't have too many eye wrinkles
my eyes are not sensitive to eye creams normally
unfortunately this one did nothing for my under eye puffiness
so although i didnt find a solution for my puffiness
this gave me wrinkles.
skin texture worsened also.
usually i'll have a pimple or two
recently i've gotten pimples literally all over my face
i do not have facial ache, and no discoloration.
i get a pimple every few weeks
dryness on my skin
sometimes in my hair
made my skin burn and itch.
my skin became so congested that i needed a facial
now i am left with a face full of whiteheads
have been suffering from runny
almost like i had an allergic reaction.
leaving at least one pimple after use
few tiny zits risen up
i actually rarely get pimples.
blotchy in the morning
no noticeable effects on puffiness
unfortunately it would cause severe redness in my cheeks after using it for a few days
so did the breakouts
i didn't notice any reduction in wrinkles or my dark spots on my cheeks
many small acne starts to appear around my chin
i am 38 with no major wrinkles
it did however it did help zap a few stubborn pimples on my cheeks
aside from the dryness
my skin is dry/normal yet acne prone with large pores
i don't have acne really
this mask literally does nothing for my acne.
a few hours later my forehead has about 4-5 small pimples
i still have all the blackheads i started out with
all i got was more dryness
but- after 2 days of use it gave me teenage acne.
i'd pick just oily over oily/teenage acne.
create some weird cloudiness
it also caused me to have 4 huge pimples by the end of the day
for reference, i have oily, acne-prone skin.
this was not for my sensitive acne prone skin.
i read several reviews before purchasing as my skin is acne prone
it did nothing to lighten the hyperpigmentation on my medium-deep
under the eyes due to many acne scars some sun spots
use to help with puffiness
this one gives me an allergy
burns my under eye skin
however the itchy eyes and watering have not.
wouldn't recommend to people who have sensitive or allergy prone skin
i do not have wrinkles or sagging skin around that areas
this did not help with my puffiness or under eye circles
want to really start trying to prevent wrinkles
noticed reduced puffiness for a few weeks
have tried lots of eye creams
it didn't address my puffiness
i wanted it to reduce puffiness
causes itching during the day
no improvement in puffiness
caused pimples to my dry to combination skin
in the next morning i saw my skin with all redness
no redness any more
there was so much redness in my face
not enough for combination dehydrated skin with dry patches or skin that is dried out from using acne products
the glamglow hydrating treatment resulted in no noticeable effects on my skin
this was recommended by a sephora employee as the solution to my forehead dryness
blotchy for about 3 days afterwards
i've also had breakouts on my chin
i've had two new pimples form on my chin
my eye wrinkles weren't as noticeable
the commenters who have written about the product flaking or balling up are correct
still can't prevent dryness caused by this eye sunscreen
doesn't seem to be helping with wrinkles
some kind of allergy i think
wake up with at least 3 new zits
noticed it got rid of some of my acne marks
prevent visible signs of aging
this lotion caused me to find little pimples everywhere
"pills" off the skin
i generally have small bumps on my forehead--not acne
cucumber gel mask on for a good hour before the redness started coming down
the only thing that it worked for was my pimples as a spot treatment only
no change in my hyper pigmentation from acne scars
in terms of correcting hyper-pigmentation
i am 57 and don't get pimples.
i am acne prone.
which is acne-prone
my wrinkles aren't as deep or as noticeable.
did help with the puffiness sometimes
although it may diminish puffiness
would help with my rosacea
i seem to get some skin congestion each time i use it on my acne-prone skin too
the only ingredient that seems like it might cause this for acne-prone skin is the linoleic acid perhaps?
it gave me nasty pimples after using it twice
some wrinkles that bother me
it kind of made my skin itch.
it has the consistency of dippity do hair gel
it did leave a lot of redness on my nose for an hour
didn't irritate my skin
i got allergy no as usually.
the skin along her jawline became crepey
ive been getting these tiny cluster of little bumps that looks like acne or tiny whiteheads
ive never had acne especially on my cheeks.
i just assumed it was eye allergy to something seasonal
it just exacerbated my dryness
cause major breakouts along my cheeks.
i usually don't have acne only the monthly ones
this made my sensitive skin blotchy
it's non irritating for acne prone skin or those that suffer with rosacia
my 40 year old combination hyper pigmented skin needs more coverage
i got 4 pimples on my face :
if you are prone to breakouts
it looked like i had a sunburn!
i applied this and it started tingling.
as other reviews have stated: no-no for acne-prone
i looked like i had a mild sunburn
it did not resolve my issues with puffiness
this eye cream definitely helps with puffiness
it gave me minor milia
got a nasty pimple by my eye after using this
i don't suffer from dark circles or puffiness
during the winter this helped solve the dryness problem
i do not have wrinkles
avoid this eye cream.
it does not cause any irritation or pimples
this product not only make my eye area itchy
it didn't extract my blackheads.
it did absolutely nothing for my hyper pigmentation
has not caused minor breakouts
did not remove any of my blackheads
it did not pull out any blackheads
i didn't see it pull any blackheads.
it definitely pulled out way more blackheads
no reduction in blackheads at all.
even though there were some blackheads
this did get some blackheads out of my nose
really did nothing for my blackheads.
could take care of my crazy blackheads
no blackheads were removed
for someone who has really visible blackheads
it pulled out so many blackheads
didn't remove the blackheads
blackheads were not removed
the only reason i gave this product 1 star is it get's out some blackheads
s for blackhead removal
did not remove any blackheads
it pulled out some blackheads
when i woke up some blackheads were worse
didn't remove any blackheads
i don't have horrible blackheads because i have a pretty elaborate skin care regimen
i still have the same blackheads
whiteheads that have been there
has helped tremendously even after a few applications with puffy allergy eyes
noticing that several other reviewers are having problems with the sunscreen ingredients too
it does not help with my blemishes
im not one to breakout: i rarely have acne
noticed small breakouts all over my cheeks
i got 3 massive pimples on my face after using this
a lot of my blackheads have gone away
taking care of my skin
my skin was soft & clearing up with my acne.
this eye gel is terrible
this eye gel is the worst.
on top of that i already have wrinkles that come with allergies
starting to see some hereditary hooding over my eyes
i felt the product did help with puffiness
the wrinkles are still there.
my wrinkles are super exaggerated
i don't have problems with skin products usually
i immediately experienced a flushing sensation
blotchy redness on my face
don't tend to have issues with dryness
would not cause acne
don't have many wrinkles
i got a couple whiteheads on my forehead
evens out a lot of my redness
after just a couple days use i developed pimples
breakouts on my cheeks
it was first time that i was allergic to a skin care product
now my face burns
concentrating on the hyperpigmentation spots
does not induce breakouts
didn't irritate my skin.
i always get pimples the day after i use this
so they were real wrinkles
this eye cream got me at "reducing puffiness."
hormonal acne prone skin
acne prone dry skin
these breakouts are all over
i've also noticed more breakouts.
little to no acne concerns
feels nice it caused acne in the areas that i applied it
it didn't caused any outbreak or irritation
the sales lady said it will help with hyperpigmentation
sun spots/pimple scars
whenever my skin has problems
i assumed it was allergy season
my allergist said reactions on the eyelids were almost always due to something applied topically
i still have discoloration on my cheeks
this did nothing to help with redness
this didn't do anything for my rosacea.
i don't see any reduction in redness
it did not reduce the redness
it did not reduce the appearance of my wrinkles
as a sufferer from mild rosacea
it doesn't reduce redness- if anything
i don't notice any reduction in redness
i don't see much of a redness-reducing effect
new blemishes every day
it left my skin itchy after the first 2 uses
causing small bumps along my jawline
help any forming wrinkles
i don't see any reduction in redness
it didn't seem to help with my redness/irritation
this serum does not seem to reduce redness.
at least 25% of my face is now covered in acne

if you are prone to breakouts of have sensitive skin
it's causing some mild irritation
i don't have lines/wrinkles
it does seem to lighten acne scars
i always have bad marks left over from acne
however i broke out with acne
the breakouts didn't stop
does not help with breakouts
sensitive bad acne prone skin
while i never get acne
my skin is still acne prone
it hasn't done anything to alleviate my face's perpetual redness
treating the dryness than this mask
i do not really have a problem skin apart from some hyper-pigmentation

the serum gave me a few pimples on area that i don't normally breakout
i don't have any wrinkles yet
not helping my dryness at all
pimples all over my face
it led to full on pimples
i wanted to use this product to lighten the acne scars on my cheeks

will cause breakouts gallore if use frequently
i am trying to address dryness

i heard this was a magical oil that would help with acne scars
it did nothing for redness
acne scars on my face
the redness in my skin was gone

it does seem to tighten up puffiness
my skin concerns are oiliness

my skin started flaking
almost as if i had a horrible sunburn!
never had acne etc
made the redness on my face drier than normal.
the wrinkles had to go
which helps with puffiness
i've never been diagnosed with rosacea

this might work for someone who has mild acne
it does nothing to help acne
it is possibly causing more breakouts
i believe its use caused several small pimples to flare up to monster sized craters
i saw many reviews for it helping with redness
aside it not helping my redness
i wrote this mainly for anyone else looking to use it for redness issues
still harsh for those with chronic redness even when mixed with an oil
works great as a spot treatment for milia

i wanted to start using retinal
i always thought a retinol should irritate your skin
have been dealing with hormonal acne
it has caused so many more breakouts :
it did clear my skin of any acne
have some wrinkles due to sun damage
this didn't do anything to blur my pores or fine lines/wrinkles
i just added some more on my cheek bone since i have sunspots there
that causes it to pill as well
i've recently developed allergies to common sunscreen ingredients which have left my face marked
my breakouts have resurfaced
the scent is so strong it gave me an immediate migraine

i originally bought it because i have acne scars all over my face
hyper pigmentation looks the same
don't have many fine lines or wrinkles
my skin doesn't have any allergy to it
my skin was flaking
my eye wrinkles actually looked worse
for all you ladies prone to milia
the gold version did nothing for my redness.
i never get pimples much less a breakout
will get a migraine in like 2seconds
can have problems flaking off when used with other products
it caused my foundation to pill
it also caused the skin on my nose to start peeling from dryness
i usually have 1-2 pimples around jawline/chin
i know physical blockers tend to be thick

did not remove blackheads.
all of the types of acne
i will have pimples the next morning from this mask
after hearing that this helps with acne
i woke up to two more pimples
realized the redness continued
my face became blotchy
this product is causing me more scarring than relief from acne scars
pore size or my redness caused by acne
didn't harm my skin
it just isn't suitable to layer over my acne treatment
blemishes are still there
did not prevent breakouts at all
it did not cause any breakouts
it did not help at all with pimples
did help smooth irritation of my pimples
sure my hyper pigmentation is fading
my dermatologist says it's mostly due to time
i really would not buy this for acne scars.
forehead also broke which i typically do not suffer from acne
this ended up irritating my rosacea-prone skin
woke up with three pimples
the one you use after sunburn
especially not for acne-prone skin
very very acne prone
i don't have bad under eyes circles nor puffiness
this treatment did sting my face
unfortunately it gave me a bit of redness
pregnancy hormones have made my skin thirsty
recommend it for people that are not acne prone
this serum irritate my skin my skin a little
the redness goes does overnight with aloe if you're not too sensitive
now i have more acne scars to brighten so this sort of did the opposite of what i wanted -_- beware if you have acne prone oily-combo skin
like i'm talking bout puberty acne typa break out
i've never even had hairline acne
but this product gave me several blemishes.
thankfully my regular skin care routine had those pimples gone by the next morning
caused really severe allergy to my skin
but this aggravated my time of the month acne.
although i don't have much wrinkles this did take away discoloration making my skin tight supple
no wrinkles of any kind
didn't tighten skin or reduced any wrinkles at all
chest during summer exposure
sensitive skin with a lot of acne scarring on my cheeks
i felt like it was causing some breakouts.
acne prone adult skin
i don't know if my adult acne/oily type skin does
for people who have acne
the next morning i had some new pimples :(
algae ones the most
i tried out the green tea mask because i had a few stubborn pimples
i honestly saw less redness in my face
made my eyesight very blurry
if anything, it just helped my acne feel...calm?
like some treatments do
i never saw any improvement in the pigment of my scarring
maybe it works for people who have blotchy skin or some freckles or something
doesnt seem to improve scarring or pigmentation
i reacted quite badly to it--think redness
some uneven skin tone/redness secondary to dry areas
or the small blemishes from dry patches
feels like a pretty nasty sunburn for two to three hours after using the laser
found it only helpful with my under eye puffiness
i gave it 3 stars because it did really help with the puffiness
because it claims to reduce redness
my sister has more of that 'nervous' redness or 'been in the kitchen too long' redness
just to calm random redness.
this didn't cause pimples
cause some minor breakouts
didn't help my discoloration or pigmentation.
it should be on the list of moisturizers for people who have acne or blemish prone skin
the only time i get acne is when my skin reacts badly to a product
didn't reduce bags or puffiness
i don't have wrinkles yet so this worked as a wrinkle fighter
as for helping with puffiness
this has been one of the worst eye creams i have used
the puffiness is completely gone
you need something for puffiness
i got it for the puffiness
i don't have wrinkles
it definitely reduces puffiness
i don't have wrinkles
i do get redness
puffiness around my eyes
it does nothing for puffiness under the eye at all
on the first night i had 1 zit

oily/acne-prone/sensitive
f you aren't acne prone
i didn't see any change in redness
don't see much of a change in the redness caused by irritation on my cheeks
bought this to help reduce the redness
does nothing for any redness
i think it helped a bit with my rosacea
this serum did nothing for my skin's redness
i only used this product one day on a recommendation for redness reduction
it actually appeared to enhance the redness around my cheeks
the redness decreases some soon applying this serum
i feel like it hasn't really done anything for my rosacea
no noticeable redness relief benefit
it says it decreases redness
nothing for my redness around my cheeks
no noticeable reduction in redness after 3 weeks of use
my skin is fair with some redness.
i do notice a slight difference in reducing redness
i noticed a little change in the redness
ultra blotchy red skin
i've always searched for a product to smooth out my sensitive redness
in fact i had a few more pimples
itchy after the first 2 steps
i got little whiteheads everywhere.
it did nothing for my skins texture or hyperpigmentation
i am in my early 30's with acne
it has done wonders for my acne
a little redness on my cheeks
non-irritating eye cream
i do think that the cream has helped with puffiness
would steer clear if you have oily/acne prone skin
discoloration or general radiance
it made my skin feel great however it also caused my skin to pill
i also noticed a lot more small pimples
pills on the skin
it also caused bad acne so i'm returning
already got two pimples because of the grease
it cause patchiness from the moisturizer
wrinkles were more noticeable
pills all over my face
usually i can notice a difference with anti-aging creams on my nose
it also did nada for my redness which is disappointing
i also got a couple tiny whiteheads.
then i noticed when it would heal a zit
it also didn't do anything for my redness
the acne that i had began to clear
had to make an appointment with a cosmetic dermatologist to help get cleared up
f you are prone to acne i would watch out
i did notice a slight reduction in redness in y cheeks
reduce redness as my skin turned-over
i woke up to new pimples in unusual spots.
especially in regards to acne
this didn't do anything for my acne prone skin.
my redness didn't go down
i don't struggle with dryness there
then it got itchy.
the intense amount of rubbinh could lead to premature wrinkles
it's getting into my eyelashes
slightly wrinkles under my eye
strong enough to give me headaches
worst it made me break out with pimples
i never used to get blackheads
even though i get acne
not only was it causing blackheads
it also was causing redness
discoloration on my face
i will have to go to my dermatologist
after checking with my dermatologist
unfortunately i also noticed several whiteheads
i don't think anyone with acne prone skin should use this
unfortunately this causes breakouts for me
i read on their instagram that older bottles can cause blackheads
have developing whitehead breakouts by the end of the day
it's concentrated along my jawline
with blackheads developing on the cheek area
i deal with mild acne
i love any facial product.
usually experience breakouts in my t-zone
didn't have any extra redness or breakouts
when i woke up, i was covered in pimples.
find this product to cause breakouts
puffiness if i don't get good sleep
wrinkles under my eyes
i would never recommend this to anyone especially if you have acne scarring/sensitive skin/texture
now that i've gotten the acne under control
when i get a new acne scar
the past acne marks are still there
i'd say this is good for acne scars
i almost didn't get this one because i also have freckles
so many people commented that this faded their freckles
lightening of my hyperpigmentation spots
it worked for my hyperpigmentation
to get results on the face without irritation or breakouts
it has not helped with reducing the visibility of my acne scars
only a couple of slight places that have hyperpigmentation
it hasn't helped with reducing the visibility of my acne scars
there was undoubtably a reduction in my hyperpigmentation from acne scars after using this once or twice a day
i realized that the serum was actually the source of tiny blackheads
i may try the post acne product
def not for deeper discoloration
when i have an acne breakout there is postinflammatory hyperpigmentation
freckling under the eyes
hoping to get rid of my stupid acne scars
i just wanted to lighten up my acne scars
i know people who have acne
the one acne scar i was trying to fade is no less prominent than before
i don't think my acne scar is any noticeably lighter than before
i'd rather get rid of my scars
night on some acne scars
however i started getting blackheads as soon as i started using it
never had a blackhead problem before
thinking temporary blackheads are a small price to pay for getting rid of scarring
i added this to my skin care regimen hoping it would fade my acne scars
instead, this made my acne so much worse!!!
i've noticed some lightening for the darkest of my acne scars already
will continue to use to see if it helps with the hyper-pigmentation from the previous acne scars i got during that time
since using this product it has left me with a face full of acne
brought on more acne flareups
i look like i have a facial sunburn from a nonexistent beach trip
it didnt help my hyperpigmentation lighten or go away
my skin is tingling/slightly burning after use
the zit i had was practically invisible
didn't clear up any acne
told me this is too harsh for normal skin with breakouts this would maybe be okay for severe oily skin with horrible acne
it didn't worsen my skin
my acne seems to be spreading a little on to my cheeks
my acne was really bad
still dealing with acne
my acne wasn't better
it caused more acne
it did nothing for my acne
my entire forehead has a bunch of pimples right now
i usually never get pimples there
in the morning my acne seemed to have been calmer
have continued to have uncontrollable breakouts
also cleared up by acne very well
is a known skin irritant
it did rid my face of acne
not one for acne
my dermatologist gave me an antibiotic cream for my acne
my acne has built a very strong immune system to salicylic acid
if i do get any acne
white pustules all over my face
i started to get blemishes
my combo acne prone skin didn't like this at all.
thus created more acne
it didn't help me with my acne
my acne hasn't gotten better or worse
it is definitely the cleanser causing the problems
i am trying to forestall injectables
it did not irritate my skin at all or cause any harmful effects
