this had no negative reviews here on sephora
a quick rundown of my skin
i don't write reviews until i finish the product
i agree with a lot of the reviews in here
i tried this twice based off all the glowing reviews i saw of it on youtube
completed the entire bottle before writing this review
it didn't break me out as other folks have experienced based on the reviews
after reading reviews i went to sephora to check out the full size first h
i checked the reviews
based on other reviews
i read every review
i rarely write reviews
i really wanted to love this due to all the rave reviews
i read the reviews for this product before purchasing--i'm prone to adult acne
i read a blog post on how great this was
my review is 100% honest
i always read the reviews before i use a product
i should have read the ingredients list here
i've read that a couple of reviewers had the same issue
based on rave reviews i think it just might not agree with my particular skin type
i read all the great reviews
after reading all of the reviews
i saw how good the reviews was
i tried it on my elbows after reading a few reviews of other people's success with that area
i saw so many reviews on this product
read lots on it too of so many people raving about it
i've heard people rave of this product
as previous reviewers mentioned
like other reviewers i found this product caused breakouts
nothing to write home about
i didn't have the application issues that other reviewers mentioned
after reading reviews i see most people think it's pointless
like the other reviews
i ordered this after browsing the many many rave reviews speaking to its ability to cleanse without adding extra oil
despite reading some of the poor reviews
after reading some reviews
i should have read the ingredient list
my more detailed review is below.
i do t get all the rave reviews.
as another reviewer mentioned
suggestions i could find
i do agree with other reviews that it is sticky
like other reviewers have said
i read article after article to make sure it wasn't the hype
first of all, i can't read the tiny instructions.
i read that i wasn't the only one
provide an honest review
i received the product for free from sk-ii for my honest review
i resorted to reading other reviews to figure it out
i am ranking 3 stars in hopes that someone reads this review
it really didn't live up to the hype i'd read in other reviews
i don't notice the cooling effect i read about.
i got this eye team based on the reviews
wanted to love this after seeing 5 star reviews
my skin did have some of the issues reported by other reviewers
like the other reviews said
sephora should be embarrassed that this is the third time i'm writing this review because they keep deleting negative reviews
note to sephora: have the guts to post this review finally
my review failed to post
all comments/thoughts are my own
i did receive the product to review from influenster
all opinions are my own and i am 100% honest.
i received the estee edit voxbox from influenster with this product included for free
but read the ingredients.
i will write a review about that one in a few weeks time
i emailed the company
don't usually write reviews
i read the reviews
reading all the wonderful reviews here on sephora as well as other sites
got this based on the good reviews on this
i read all the reviews about how it smells funny
i think the ingredients info needs updating.
i don't ever write reviews
the reason why i wanted to write a review is that i don't like the packaging at all
can't comment on the efficacy
some reviewers say they like the scent.
posted a photo of glowing skin
read all reviews before purchasing this
like other reviewers mentioned- the pump is horrible
had to try this cleanser after reading the description
as others have mentioned
after reading the reviews i thought i would give this a try
as i have posted in my review of the "power couple"
there are a lot of positive reviews
finally read reviews like i had been meaning too
i agree w/ all the reviews preceding this one
raved about it to many people
i read the directions
definitely do not buy- i ignored the other reviews
i received the product free for my honest review.
i read the reviews on how it lifts the eyelid area
i don't understand all the 4 and 5 star reviews.
decided to give this one a try based on the reviews
overall it was a very mixed review
i know a lot of reviews ranked this items with 5 stars
after reading all of the reviews i decided to purchase- despite the high price point
should have read reviews first.
on youtube give this a great review
i saw a few glowing reviews for this product on youtube
as countless other commenters have also mentioned
i very rarely give negative reviews
review this on youtube
please leave any tips you have for using it in the reviews
nothing to write home about.
as for the first reviewer
take a page from my book
since i've read only good reviews i decided to give it a try
i read the reviews
continue to read your reviews for more ideas
took some time testing it out before writing this review
if you're reading this
definitely agree with the other reviewer about it being cheaply made
this product reminded me of a primer
checked the ingredient list
i usually don't take the time to write comments about products
the consultant also mentioned it would work as a primer
i can't read most of the packaging
but i noticed on beauty blogs and sites.
this was getting good reviews.
even after reading negative reviews i went out
i heard a youtuber talking about it
like most of the comments have said
i need to preface this by saying that i'm a huge tatcha fan
surprised i didn't read reviews first.
i read the reviews
i wanted to love this because of the other reviews
which some people describe as light
like another reviewer said
after readings its reviews
plus i saw all the high reviews
bummer because i read such great reviews.
i rarely write negative reviews because what doesn't work for me might do wonders for you
the amount of artificial fragrance is the reason i wrote this review
reading the other reviews
however i read reviews saying that they broke out from this
this is my honest review.
the closest i have read in reviews is that it smells like after shave
nothing to write home about
should've read the ingredients first.
i misread the label
also had good reviews
the reviews i read prior to purchasing
i read about the purging phase
i read several reviews about other people who had the same problem warning that this "purging phase" is not a phase
i've seen so many positive reviews about it
wanted this product to work after reading all the great reviews
check out my full video to see a review
t pains me to even write this review
whatever you do don't read the ingredient list
as another reviewer commented
this had such great reviews from people with similar skin issues
because of the good reviews on this product i decided to give this a try
i don't write too many reviews unless the product impacts me in some way
read so many glowing reviews for it on sephora
i got a sample from sephora because i read all the great reviews
i read in the reviews that the tube had a lot of air in it
reading reviews from others or recommendations in magazines
and no bad reactions either.
this had so many good reviews
the reviews are what made me purchase this product
it was all hype in my opinion
read the directions before using it on my face
wouldn't personally buy from my own reaction to the mask
read so many glowing reviews of this cleanser
tried this out based on all the positive reviews
my review keeps being deleted..
i read reviews of this product
i read the instructions
i read all the reviews
read all the reviews
the reviews on this product were amazing
after hearing it be raved about
it takes a lot for me to write a review
after seeing glowing reviews
got this one based on reviews
my more detailed review video is below.
decided to try this due to all of the raving reviews
to see a more in-depth review check out my you tube review
after reading reviews i was convinced this would be great
like one of the other reviews i wake up with dryness
i really wanted to like this product after reading other reviews

i loved the reviews
read some reviews and decided to give it a try.
i read all the reviews for this product before buying this
i read a review about this product in a magazine
i read the reviews
all of the positive reviews
i read reviews that people have used it by itself
i really had high hopes after reading the reviews
some reviews for this product mentioned it worked well for lighter skin tones
after reading the raving reviews
i wish i understood all the positive reviews.
as some other reviewers have noted
on a more positive note
i wanted to try this one despite some negative reviews
decided after reading many reviews i was going to give it a shot
despite the glowing reviews its received from many others
my more detailed review video is below.
i hoped to like this cream after reading positive reviews
if you read this review
had high hopes that this could be the one from reading the sephora reviews
thought i would try this due to the excellent reviews
i received this product for review by influenster
to start this review off
i received this item through influenster in exchange for my honest review
after reading reviews i decided to remove my eye makeup prior to washing my face
like another review said
*i received this product for free for my unbiased opinion*
i received this product to write a homest review
i like the presentation
i received this product for review
i recieved these through influenster.
all thoughts are my own
seeing the other reviews confirmed that is
based on the excellent reviews
i agree with another reviewer.
i read reviews before buying it
i read a lot of reviews on this product.
thought we could upload picture.
ii would like to mention that i do not write reviews
my more detailed review video is below
i received this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review
i received product for free to review from influenster
enough to write my first review
i tried patting it on skin like other reviewers said
after having this products for months i decided to finally write a review
the reviews were great
all opinions are my own
like others have mentioned
i agree with the other reviewer who said skin looked "starved"
i agree with the other reviews saying it is like water on your face
that's about where the positive reviews end
bought this because of all the rave reviews
as another reviewer mentioned
i read tens of good reviews about this product
my more detailed review video is below.
bought after reading many positive reviews on this product
in my personal opinion
hence the three mentions before as my favorites
i heard the review is very good!
my more detailed review video is below.
i received this complimentary from influenster for product review :
this product was sent to me via influenster for review
i received this complimentary to review by influenster
however all opinions are my own
the instructions weren't so explicit.
gave this a try because of the good reviews
all of the reviews for this product got my hopes up
bought this because of the good reviews
i read other reviews saying it was drying
every review on this product is 5 stars
i guess i was the only one judging by these reviews
this is my 3rd attempt to write a review.
i received this cream to try and review.
i will update later
all opinions are my own
i received this product free for review from influenster
the enclosed instructions referred to products that weren't there
i usually don't take the time to write a review
i don't normally write reviews because most products end up working for me for the most part
like some other reviews here
as if i were glowing
i read a review of this somewhere
for some reason my review was deleted.
i appreciate time others take to review products
judging from the other reviews
i spent a good chunk of time reading reviews
for those who praise this oil
the results of my post-makeup look
saw so many reviews that said just that
give their unbiased results
as another reviewer said-- it's basically colored water
after commenting on an instagram post
my more detailed review video is below.
waited about 2 months to try it because the reviews weren't that great
i will try for the third time to submit a review for this product
my last two reviews were never published
hate giving bad reviews.
my more detailed review video is below.
my more detailed review video is below.
sephora stop deleting my comments !
why ask for your costumers to write reviews of all you do is delete them
never trust the reviews!!
unfortunately the reviews are right
my more detailed review and how-to is below.
i read such great reviews
i read reviews on beautypedia
i never write reviews
having read previous review about a packaging fail
they had received numerous complaints regarding the packaging
my more detailed review video is below.
like some of the other reviewers mentioned
i tend to read reviews then take them with a grain of salt
i read the reviews about how it very quickly would shrink
my review and demo are at the link below.
my more detailed review video is below.
listen this mask is a social star i get it
hearing the sephora consultants rave about it
given the positive reviews
my review video below has more details on this product
what other reviews have been saying is yes
i don't get all of the 5-star reviews
give an honest review
all opinions are my own
i received this free from influenster for my review
after reading all the great reviews
i got this for free to review from influenster
i received this complimentary from influenster for reviewing purposes
received this product complimentary from influenster for an honest review

can give it a glowing review
didn't get any negative reaction from it-
my more detailed review video is below
at this moment while i'm writing this review
all opinions are my own
all opinions are my own
i received a 7 day trial of this product from #influencer for my honest opinions
i recieved this free trial to review.
upon receiving this product i read what it's good for
when i read the reviews on this i instantly thought " i must have it "
i read the instructions
according to the precious reviews it works miracles
they read my message
if you look at all the review dates
there are a few new reviews
i really thought the reviews were helpful
read some reviewers that had the same experience
chose this formula based on other reviews i read
based on some of the other reviews
i read the reviews
idk how this has good reviews.
people are mislead by these reviews
what with the "glowing" claims
it has so many great reviews though
as many other commentors have said before me
after reading so many good reviews for this serum i decided to buy it
i’m leaving a crummy 1 star review
i read the reviews
i read something similar below
contrary from the amazing reviews
i agree with other reviewers- it is more like a balm
i researched this product
what all these other reviewers are doing different
after reading reviews clearly i'm not the only one with this problem
so many great reviews
i made a mistake of not reading the reviews before purchasing the $54 dollar one
i tried to love it after reading so many reviews
i never write reviews
nothing to write home about
i read lots of good reviews about this product
i read the 1000+ reviews on here
tried for a week bc of the reviews
especially after reading others' reviews
this product was reccomended in online chat with another store
i read the reviews on this
this review isn't about those products
i would recommend reading the review of this on beautypedia
i don't usually take the time to write a bad review
i felt compelled to write
as the other reviewer pointed out
i agree with one of the other reviewers.
i 100% agree the review before me.
after listening to her recommendations i chose this one
i saw some great reviews on this
i saw some review
the reviews online were also mostly great
i felt compelled to write one for this product
some reviews say it works well under makeup
ordered this product based on the really good review
i don't see how this is a bestseller.
other reviews said the smell was "light
taste are all a thumbs down for me
i read a lot about murad products
after reading so many positive reviews
i wish i had the same results as other reviewers of this product
compare it to my other cheek after 8 weeks
i heard great reviews on this product
i tried this because of the good reviews
nothing to write home about
so after reading all of the reviews for this product i decided to give it a try
after reading all the glowing reviews
i will keep you posted.
this product has so many good reviews.
the reviews for this bar are all raves
i posted a review before for this
i see others have posted excellent reviews
i also had read all the reviews
listened to the "bad" right reviews
i see all these great reviews
like many other reviewers have stated
after hearing so many rave reviews about this product
i didn't experience any tingling that other reviews mentioned
after reading the reviews i thought this may help tame the oily portions of my face
checked the ingredients list
as one reviewer said helped
as many reviews i'd seen on this product
came to the conclusion that i wanted to try this product based on the positive reviews
i usually don't write reviews but i do read them.
the reviews were good
i agree with the so-so comments about this product
i find it strange that the reviews for this don't list the reviewers age
after reading the reviews on this site about this product
i read rave reviews about it
so many rave reviews of this product from so many different outlets put this as my top choice
this product was raved about in several travel blogs that i read
i read a lot of good reviews on this product
i don't understand the raving reviews.
i read the reviews on this product
i read the other reviews
that's the most ridiculous instruction i've ever read
i rushed out to buy this after reading great reviews
especially after the rav reviews it received
used it as a refresher in the morning
after reading the reviews
will update review if it does
agree with the other reviewers.
went against reviewers' feedback about break-outs when sephora sales person highly recommended
i decided to give this one a try based on the great reviews
i've read that spf can contri
good reviews on it
this had good reviews
when i mentioned this
i got this based on all the rave reviews.
becuase i wanted an unbiased opinion
i hate saying anything negative
all the reviews say
i read some good reviews
this one seemed to have good reviews
after reading rave reviews
and i have heard good reviews about it.
i tried this product because of the favorable reviews
like another reviewer mentioned
bought because of previous reviews.
this was just so-so despite the raving reviews from the store
wanted to input on the smell just reading other reviews
as another reviewer stated i found that this pilled when put over acne medicine
after reading reviews on this product i decided to purchase it
i saw some reviews about people not liking the smell
after reading the mostly positive reviews
i read on another website that philosophy products are tested on animals
bought this one on a whim based on some great reviews
i looked at the clinique website for better product descriptions
was urged to write a review
it's not oil free like another reviewer said.
i got this product because of the reviews
i did not read it carefully before purchasing
all of the praise this product gets
i'll update this review in another month
despite many other reviews said
it had rave reviews
after reading all the great reviews of this product
after reading the reviews
bought it because of the reviews
i've read some reviews saying it was great for a daily moisturizer
as other reviewer was mentioning
i don't get the high reviews with this product.
as i'm writing this my eyes r tearing
i read all the positive reviews
i didn't have the great experience that many reviewers had
nothing to really write home about
i read so many great reviews.
summary-skip all pore perfecter-so
you know what i had to write a review because i am so fed up with the way the bottle dispenses this product
i read in a magazine that this was rated really high for dry skin
after reading other reviews i decided that this sounded like it worked
my results were not as favorable as other reviewers
also i keep getting emails to write a review!
i agree with other reviewers who say it feels siliconey
i wish i had read the other reviews before wasting 100 points
having read the product description
as did the reviews
i read the reviews
only 2 reviews at the time of purchase
all the other positive reviews
heard a lot of good reviews.
after reading the reviews
considered purchasing it- until i read the ingredients list
after reading a multitude of reviews claiming that this is the holy grail of eye creams
bought this because of all the positive reviews
just ignored the bad reviews
so many positive reviews
many reviews said they thought the product would be greasy
looking at other reviews
other reviewers are right.
from the reviews i read i expected this product to help brighten my skin
like most of the reviews state
i also purchased this after reading all the good reviews
i read all the reviews on this
the reviews gave it a really positive hype
i read the ingredients
i agree with the last reviewer
when you press it
just like i read before
despite the good reviews i had to return this cream
wanted to love ren after reading the reviews
bought this on basis of other reviews
i guess i expected great things because of all of the reviews i read
read the reviews for this mask
please hear our cry
i never write reviews
i should write some positive ones
i really should have read the packaging before purchase
i seen all the reviews
i never write reviews on products
i read so many great reviews
despite all the good reviews
reviews are hard to go by
i read amazing reviews about this product
after reading all these reviews about great this wash is
i read the reviews on this which were excellent
because of the positive ratings
hoping the results will sway my review
i kept hearing rave reviews about clinque
wanted to give it enough time to write a fair review
so stay posted for more critiques
like elsewhere in the reviews
some of the reviews i read before purchasing this stated that it was very drying
read reviews and purchased this item.
i read many reviews of this product before buying
i read good reviews about this item
i did a review on this product.
since this had received so many positive reviews on google
i relied on the positive reviews
it seems that sephora deleted my original review.
after reading the reviews of this i was excited to purchase
the other reviews said they saw a difference immediately
checked the ingredients list
decided to try this product based on all the positive reviews
i saw such great reviews for this product
i read the reviews before purchasing this product
just like other reviewers
purchased this product after seeing how great the reviews were
i admit- i was sold based on the reviews.
after all of the reviews
unfortunately bought this product in the store instead of online where i should've read reviews
you use the included scoop
since i saw several reviews online stating that this product has stained fingers
the good reviews i saw
i would give this product negative stars
read consumer reviews on multiple websites
learned my lesson: read reviews before you buy
i don't like to give bad reviews as this one
this product had rave reviews
purchased this based on reviews
so when i hear the words moisture surge
i agree with another review i had read.
i don't understand the rave reviews.
i wanted to love it because it got so many positive reviews
other reviews ii was expecting something nice
i read the description over
after hearing all the amazing reviews
i decided to purchase based on the glowing reviews
it makes me wonder if the perricone company is writing these reviews
this is an odd review
i read so many good reviews
i read all the rave reviews and ordered this.
from reading at the ingredients
i read bad reviews of first aid
i read on the description that it was for normal skin
based on the amazing reviews--i would have bought it
i read a lot of good reviews about the product that's why i decided to try it
will write a review on that after i've tested it!
i tried this based on reviews.
positive comments on this product
like mentioned by some
after reading such rave reviews
i read a blog raving about this product
after reading all the good reviews
will revise my review
i've also read about ha in magazines and stuff.
i found it on the web
i've read that you should give a product like 6 weeks to see results
the reviews were great
i'd like to revise my earlier review.
as with other reviewers
i don't usually write negative reviews
bought it cause of good reviews.
so....what product are you reviewing????
after reading so many reviews i thought to give this a try
i read other reviewers saying they use this with their clarisonic
wanted to love it after reading all the great reviews
write a fair review in a couple of weeks
after reading the reviews for this product
you do see some positive results
have read that it comes with consistent use after 6 weeks
i follow the directions as stated
i rarely write negative reviews as everyone has different needs
i researched this product
i really wanted to love this from all the rave reviews
they said that was confidential info
after reading other reviews complaining about it drying out their skin
after reading reviews, i thought i this was it.
after reading reviews i was expecting an immediate change in my skin
as other reviewers have noted
since most of the reviews are very positive
thumbs down for this horrible reformulation.
then post another review
seriously i was reading the other reviews
especially after the other 3 reviews i read
i decided to splurge on this after reading about it on caroline hiron's blog
even the "temporary results" mentioned in other reviews didn't work for me
wish i could rave about this product like the 2 other reviews
please disregard my review
the highly-rated reviews on sephora's website
all of the rave reviews of this product
i paid a lot money for this cleanser based on sephora reviews
thought i would based on the reviews
i wanted to try the oil free since it's rave reviews
i literally never write product reviews
i followed the advice of some reviewers who used it in conjunction with nose strips
after reading all the reveiws
after reading the reviews
with all those rave reviews
i looked through many reviews for reports of burning
a couple of reviews mentioned the flakiness
i read a review on another perricone md product
i really wanted to like this due to the positive reviews
i got this after reading all the rave reviews
the rating site was not allowing me to post my review
believe the reviews that describe the smell as fishy
none of the reviewers saying they gagged are exaggerating
i saw other reviewers complain of the smell
i rarely give one star ratings.
i agree with the other reviewers
i never write reviews but always read them.
and was compelled to write a review!
my review from a week ago was deleted.
i don't find the words to describe it
i'd heard rave reviews (hello ingrid nilsen!)
as other reviewers have noted
i couldn't find many reviews for dark circles
i did read the other reviews before buying which were not favorable
it wasn't a miracle worker as some of the other reviews claim
this is so raved about
saw the rave reviews on this product
the reviews i read for this product were kind of all of the place
i wish i had checked the reviews before purchasing
i read the reviews
with all the 4-5 star reviews
reading reviews for retinol products i decided to give this product a try
reviews raved about this working on sensitive
i figured i'd give it a try due to the rave reviews on this site
will update my review once i pass 30 days with this
i don't write many reviews
i wish i would've listened to the reviews on this before buying
i didn't read the ingredients list in the store.
after reading so many great reviews about this i couldn't help
mua's rave about this product
i hate to be the one to give bad reviews
the bad news is that
i read the product description
i've waited to try this product before writing a review
im reading all of these fabulous reviews thinking
it was never published
heard rave reviews on the sephora website so thought of buying this product
like a number of other reviewers
i learned about this product over a youtube review
this product gets a lot of love in the reviews
after reading the amazing reviews i gave to the heavy price tag that came with this product
after reading mostly glowing reviews of this product
i will update the results later.
i don't usually write bad reviews
i will update my review if i feel a serious change
i went on to write my review
i read reviews about this product
my first review didn't get published
so when i first wrote a review on this product i had nothing
purchase this after the positive reviews
after reading the description of the product
after reading the reviews
i got this because of all the good reviews.
i must have read the description
i couldn't decide to trust the bad views or the good views
although my friends rave about it
if you're sold by the other reviews
this is the first review i have ever written
i never ever write reviews
i wish i'd read the reviews before letting the sales girl talk me into this
like other reviews have said
how all these mediocre products get such glowing reviews
why this product has good reviews
wish i'd read the reviews!
i should have read about all the ingredients
so many people raved about this
like some other reviewers
please reply to this message
i read mixed reviews from those with my skin type
after reading all the reviews i splurged
i don't get all the reviews raving about the scent
when i read the label
surprised they won't correct it after reading the same comments about the residue in these reviews
i read the reviews for application tips.
like other reviewers mentioned
given some of the reviews
it could be just my skin because from other reviews
i would like to hear how other users like it.
read the reviews thought i would try.
i hesitate to write such comments for such a lovely br
i came on to read the reviews
i dont usually write reviews
as others have mentioned
as mentioned by other reviewers
this bottle is so dissatisfying it prompted me to write my first review
this bottle has received negative reviews for years
read the reviews before purchasing.
my first shiseido purchase after i studied all the reviews
like many other reviews
which in my opinion
reading such wonderful reviews
i should have listened.
like some of the other ladies mentioned
i read the reviews of a product like crazy before purchasing
as i'm reading the reviews i see that its working for a lot of people
then i read that these two products
after reading the early reviews on this product i thought i would give it a try
after trying this i like another reviewer wonder if the early reviews are real
i read that some received fantasitic results
ials read others saw no change
i hav read tons of reviews
makes me wonder who is writing all those glowing reviews??
i spent more than i normally do after reading the reviews
from reading the reviews here
the testimonials/product description on the home site leaves you w/"astonishing" dna repairing results
i read the reviews
like many of the reviewers
i actually already wrote a review for this saying all of the above
i preface this by saying i received the 100pt beauty insider version so not the full version however
nothing to write home about.
when i read the label
as many others have mentioned
scouring the reviews for additional tips
i read all the reviews
i used all the tips everyone has posted
i read the directions.
i read the directions again.
if that changes i'll update my review.
i saw another reviewer say it tasted like sharpies
thought i'd give this a try based on the reviews.
i normally don't write reviews so here we go
i didn't see any of the positive results.
not even smoothing that other reviews referred to
i don't like giving negative reviews
feel like a debbydowner writing just bad reviews today
from what it sounds like from the other reviews however
i read reviews before buying stating some saw improvements with fine lines
what about the results?
like other reviewers have said
i really had high hopes after reading some of the reviews
i've read other raving reviews
4 star reviews mention its inefficacy
decided on this one after looking through reviews
i will update my review in another 2 weeks.
i never write reviews
i feel this product is misrepresented
like another reviewer said
looked to compare the new box i have to the list i posted
after reading all the positive reviews
not reading complaints about this in other reviews
this cleanser has good reviews.
i got this after reading all the rave reviews
ordered this due to the reviews and ingredients.
it has amazing reviews from so many
after reading great reviews
after reading the reviews
like other reviewers have said
i never write reviews
i rarely write reviews
read a favorable magazine article about this masque which prompted my purchase
only one review mentioned the strong fragrance.
based on the reviews
i agree with some reviewers that the smell is rather strong
i received this product complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review
i received this as a complimentary product from influenster to give my honest review
i received this product free from influenster in exchange for an honest review
i read many other reviews with people being very happy with it
the bad reviews are right
i agree with some of the previous comments that it's an overpriced moisturizer
i tried this product out because of all the positive reviews
i also didn't notice any positive results
the instructions tell you to use this daily
had high expectations for this after having heard positive reviews
i did read the mixed reviews on how it was a holy grail for some
after reading the reviews
this had so many good reviews
i quickly purchased this during the vib sale after reading so many good reviews on here
when the reviews say that something has a "strong scent
i wanted to love this cleanser after reading all the reviews
i read all the great reviews
after reading all the reviews i thought i would give it a try
i expected a lot more from this product after reading so many reviews raving about this product
hopefully i'll return to for a positive update.
other than that- i give this mask a thumbs down
purchased this because it had such great reviews.
not only did i have zero negative reactions
why before i read some comments about it
like another reviewer mentioned
purchased this based on the reviews.
based on the reviews
if you read the ingredient list
i agree with some other reviewers
i left a glowing review previously
write the name of the treatment on the baggie
i read all the reviews relating with similar problems to other users
read so many things about this mask
based on the great reviews
as is the bottle as another reviewer stated
i saw many good reviews on this
even most of the reviews claims it to be good
as another reviewer posted
after reading positive reviews of this product
does the product works for you or you're paid to write review for this product?
since according to the study posted
the rave reviews on the site
since i heard such good reviews about it
i gave the small bottle a try due to the positive reviews
i ordered the smaller size of this after reading all the positive reviews
after reading the reviews on this product
always read the ingredients list
read the ingredients list.
thought it would based on all the glowing reviews
i didn't see the "results" like most reviews
by reading other reviews it seemed to work for others
this product is getting rave reviews everywhere i look
maybe i expected miracles after reading the reviews
based on the reviews i was expecting to see
i hate to leave bad reviews
never felt like it absorbed into my skin-even when i patted it in as one other reviewer suggested
the horrible smell of this product compelled me to write a review
this is my first time writing a review
before purchase i read the benefit
seen such good reviews
i saw so many goo reviews
it's so well-reviewed
i read all the reviews
i heard great reviews with this product
got raving reviews of this product by some sales associates in sephora
after i read all the reviews
i immediately wanted to read some reviews
seriously i've never written a bad review for any product so this is a first
reading other peoples reviews about the smell made me realized that i wasn't the only one
i should have read the reviews more closely.
every review i've read since mentions the smell.
i read the pamphlet that came in the box
like many other reviewers
like other reviewers have said
before i talk about the product
as many other reviews said
the reviews i read before purchasing said it reduced puffiness
it does leave a nice cooling effect as mentioned numerous times throughout these reviews
especially after reading so many reviews
i agree with most of these reviews
i've read other reviews across the internet that said it smells like lavender
read the ingredients list before you buy this.
i agree with many other reviewers
i do agree with the previous reviewer who stated that applying extra on problem spots alleviated their appearance
i really bought into all the positive reviews on this product
back to the actual review
i read great reviews about this cream.
i did not come across any bad reviews on the web at all
i found a blogger that describes how
luna oil to use together because of all of the amazing reviews
bought this with luna oil based on the rave reviews
no reading/watching reviews
i read reviews that suggested that this was to be expected
i know everyone raves about this product
after seeing overwhelming positive reviews for this i figured i'd try one of the two samples i got from sephora
i went for it because i read so many amazing reviews about how it transforms your skin overnight
was super excited to receive it after reading reviews
i though the need to write a review because you can't possibly use the product as directed
after reading the reviews
i looked at reviews of this product
look at the very poor reviews on a shopping channel
i read the other reviews about how the bottle was terrible
i read the other reviews
after reading the previous reviews i had high hopes
tried this because of the good reviews
i'll update my review after doing a comparison against shiseido
this product is not living up to its reviews
i read reslly great reviews about how well thus product worked
is probably the product most of the positive reviews are for
or 5 star reviews in my case
i compare it to whiteout
i read other reviews w/ the same complaint
these glowing reviews are a bit too glowing
i read so many positive reviews for this which makes it all the more disappointing that it was awful
thought i would try this as it always has rave reviews
is it as amazing as all the reviewers?
i read good reviews about this line
read the ingredients list prior to buying this product
wish it had stated that on the website description
i wanted to post a review that raved about how it lightened my dark circles by at least 30%
as mentioned in other comments
as some of the other reviews advise
i've heard so many excellent reviews
like i mentioned above
purchased this after reading the rave reviews
i never write reviews
the reviews are above-average positive
if i notice a change in skin, i will update.
as i'm reading many reviews
different people in the company write reviews-
if i see any new result, i will update my post.
based on all the reviews of this product
i've read so many good reviews about it
i hope they update the packaging.
i do know what other reviewers are talking about
like many of the other reviewers
hope this review helped!
i don't post reviews
i took a chance on this product based on reviews
so after reading reviews here
i read a lot of other reviews
after reading the first few reviews on this product
to leave this review on a positive note
i also agree with another reviewer who stated that it helps calm down redness
judging by the opinions at my local sephora
the reviews online were great
after reading reviews online
the title of my review says it all.
i decided to splurge on this based on the reviews
someone else in this comments forum mentioned that the company had been sold
i checked lancôme website for video instructions.
have mixed feelings about it
was so excited to try it after reading rave reviews on multiple websites
this is my first review on sephora.
i rarely leave reviews
i don't want other people to make the same mistake of buying this after reading the reviews
sorry to not have better feedback as i tend to enjoy most of your products
then i read the instructions
can give an honest review of this product
i received this product for free to review.
there was no product insert included with the product detailing benefits
i received this product for free for my honest review
i wish i could of reviewed this product in winter though
have checked for results
surprised this product was the one they recommended me in store given the poor reviews online
read reviews of the same thing happening to others
after reading the great reviews on this product i couldn't wait to try it
after reading such good reviews i chose to buy the small version of this oil
after a quick scroll through the reviews
based on the reviews i choose this one
i read the reviews for this product
i shouldn't review this yet
the good reviews i read
another critique i have is the packaging
like some of the other reviewers
i read so many good reviews
i don't understand the reviews.
given the many amazing reviews
as another reviewer mentioned i also have noticed this cream contri
update if there's a change
i've read a lot of other reviews, too.
read a lot of good reviews
i know, seems contradictory.
which another reviewer mentioned
i just had to write a review
hate leaving negative comments or reviews
because i read a great review about this product
not sure about other reviewers
bought this product because of high reviews
i'll update the progress later
i wrote a review last week about how horrible this products is
my review got deleted
when i first reviewed this product i wasn't noticing any benefits
nothing to write home about
i agree with almost every other reviewer that this crime does half the job
i've heard many great reviews on this product.
like some other review suggested
i agree with couple other reviewers
after reading a few reviews
i really wanted to like this after reading the reviews
the reviews were good
the reviews are mixed
i wish i had taken pictures to upload
this mask didn't live up to the good reviews on the website
despite the good reviews i read prior to purchasing the nars mask i was not impressed
i don't normally write reviews
maybe i can update my review
when i checked the ingredients list
i usually never write reviews
i don't get all these positive reviews?
can't comment on what other reviewers are saying regarding that
for the reviews mentioning the smell.
it most definitely has a fishy smell as noted by other reviewers
i gave this product a one star review because
agree with the reviewer who said this just sits on top of the skin
like other reviewers i used the sample before reading here that it's a self tanner
gross' company because of the review i gave the original formulation
started reading reviews of this product
so i have mixed reviews about this product.
i chose this one based on the reviews
read how great c is for both problems
i received this product complimentary from influenster for my honest review
i received this product free for review from influenster
i received this complimentary from influenster for review
i wanted to finish the bottle before submitting my review
i agree with the other reviewer- stay away!
i should have read the ingredients before purchasing
difference that others have mentioned
from the reviews that i've read
after reading the reviews it seems like several people have had this same issue
this product has mostly amazing reviews
i'd heard it worked really well from other reviews
i read the ingredients online
i heard a lot of good reviews on how it treats acne
after reading great reviews of the lotus oil on several websites
as it hasn't been updated
after reading the other reviews
like i've seen other reviewers note
i heard amazing reviews on this item.
or compared to others leaving their reviews
i wish i'd read the reviews before i tried
led it with care because of other reviews i read about it breaking easily
i reviewed another product from the same br
after reading the ingredient list
the reviews are raving
reviews this product had received
after reading several reviews i'd say my expectations were pretty bang on for this product
i checked other reviews
as i've read rave reviews about all things tata harper
glad product suits some other reviewers
this is the first time i feel compelled to write a review for a product
my first review.....i just had to write a review.
i read reviews about this product before purchasing it
i read on other reviews that 1 pump is enough to cover your whole face
let me start by saying that whenever i read a review
from the look of the other reviews
i hate to be this brutal in a review
nothing to write home about
purchased this oil after reading all the glowing reviews
this product receives rave reviews
lots of reviews reading before i decided to buy it
i will update in a couple of months.
i expected this product to be as amazing as all of the reviews said
list all of the things i liked about it:
am just reviewing this product's effectiveness on under eye circles
given the glowing reviews i have seen
i agree with the other reviewer that said this isn't for very dry eyes
i don't usually write reviews
everyone raves about it
had high expectations after the reviews
please check out the other
glowing write ups in magazines
i heard great reviews on this
i've heard a lot of good words about shiseido ibuki series
usually when i read these reviews
as other people have mentioned
i read all these reviews that say "good for oily skin"--- absolutely not
i read a lot of previous review
at first reading the reviews made me excited to try these out
i never write reviews
i read the reviews
dennis gross get such rave reviews
as another reviewer admitted
i saw the other users review to try it on your h
this is an update of my last review for this serum
beyond the terrible smell that many reviewers have already noted
i read the ingredients
read the other reviews of how customers were claiming how drying
it is my first time to write a bad review
i wanted to like this product based on reading the majority of great reviews
as other reviewers have noted
from the reviews i thought it would be foamy
with all the glowing reviews
good reviews that it would work
many of the reviewers said it stung their eyes.
how this has good reviews
this would have been a 5 star review
so bummed to have to write this review.
smells very strong as noted from other reviewers.
reading some of the other reviews
although this isn't the case with many of the reviews
i hate giving bad reviews.
go read the reviews on that
i read rave reviews about this product.
many of the other reviewers love the smell
there have been so many positive reviews about
i read all the reviews before purchasing it.
went with the positive reviews
because i've heard great reviews in the past
my more detailed review video is below.
nor the type to review a product
i don't usually write reviews
thank goodness for the other reviewer who indicated her sensitive skin's reaction
when i read the ingredients
based on the great reviews
true to the other reviews
as it seems to be a love or hate relationship based on the reviews
i read all of the rave reviews
i suggest you read the list
the reviews seemed amazing.
especially after reading a lot of reviews here
especially after seeing all the reviews
as much as i hate leaving a negative review i think that if i would have read my comment i wouldn't have purchased this product
i follow the instructions
after reading reviews chose this
i feel bad writing a negative review
like another reviewer below me
positive reviews for the product
after reading a lot of great reviews
i am surprised at the positive reviews as this was such a waste of money for such a bad product
although i had none of the problems some other reviewers had
i heard all the reviews on this product
after reading so many positive reviews
i read such raving reviews about this product
i don't believe i've ever written a review
rritated with the packaging of this product i have to write a review
i've got to agree with several of the other reviews here
i read several reviews before purchasing as my skin is acne prone
i don't know who this cream works on as the reviews have no age showing
i never write reviews
i went in to sephora to purchase a specific product that had great reviews
i can hear my pores clogging as i write this.
in my own opinion
the commenters who have written about the product flaking or balling up are correct
i hope my non-glowing review won't be mysteriously deleted
very sad unfortunately the negative reviews keep getting deleted after 24 hours that is very deceiving for potential customers
i agree with the other reviewers 100% that this product "balls up"
i read so many good reviews
after reading many reviews i decided to try it for myself
i heard so many great reviews on this product about the blurring effect this could create
i really should have read more reviews on this product before purchasing
saw a review of this on youtube
this was so bad that i felt compelled to write my first review
some comments have complained of the scent
as other reviewers have noted
i decided to splurge after reading all the good reviews
i too wonder if these reviews are fake!
after reading the description
after reading all the reviews
the reviews made me want to buy this
i dont normally write reviews
as i read everyone elses reviews on different products i want to try
i didn't ask for any other recommendations for dark circle correction
with all the rave reviews
based on all of the other reviews i'm apparently in the minority
i agree with the previous reviewer.
i picked this up during the vib sale as a "treat yo self" purchase after seeing rave reviews about it
i read several reviews of sensitive skin people having bad reactions to this product
i follow instructions from the reviews
i love to read all of them
most of the other negative reviews that were up were deleted
i never write any review before
i read some reviews before
i've read some of the other reviews
will write back with another true review once i notice any changes
after reading other reviews i saw the serum has less coverage
lesson to me, read the label.
i've read lots of good reviews about the product
i should have read the ingredient list before buying this
normally i wouldn't write a review on a free sample
in case that matters for this review
wish i had read reviews before trying.
then we scroll down the list
the cream does not stay as another reviewer suggests
based on all the glowing reviews it received
i used up an entire an jar of this before writing my review
it didn't perform for me as it had for other reviewers
was excited when i read the reviews on this one
i read the reviews of that product a variety of times
despite seeing many negative reviews
i read the bad reviews
i read the reviews
like many of the reviewers here
nothing to write home about, but ok.
read the review here and now i know why!
after reading the other reviews it's actually a common issue
i've heard so many good reviews
as other reviewers have
i disagree with other reviews saying this is like glue
as other reviewers have said
had enough to write a review
i don't understand the positive reviews.
i've never written a review before however
of course i'm the 1 in 10000 who didn't find this product as amazing as the reviews
she raved about it
i've read many reviews from oily-skinned people raving about this product as well
according to the reviews this seemed like a good product to try
i wanted to love this night cream after reading all of the other reviews
as another review said
i read some great reviews.
bought this because of the good reviews.
another reviewer said bacon bits
i read several reviews that also raved about how well it took off makeup
i've read good review about what the product can do
after reading multiple good reviews about this korres product
i read great reviews
i'll update my review when i gauge whether this was the breakout culprit
as evidenced by the two earlier reviews
before buying this product i heard mixed reviews
read all the rave reviews
saw many similar reviews online
contrary to other what other reviewers say
read the reviews for this product
i always read the reviews before i buy products
i heard rave reviews about this product
saw all the positive reviews
i read all of the reviews
it seems the reviews are mixed
the rating site was not allowing me to post my review
my detailed review is below.
it has such amazing reviews
i also bought this based off the good reviews it got
i just bought this based on the reviews
the reviews of this product were so high
in spite of the other reviews
i received this item from sephora
no email or social media replies
i will update this as time goes by
i hope other people see what i wrote
i didn't read that in the description on sephora
my detailed review is below.
i read the reviews of this
which were all glowing
other reviewers raved about this
i can read what it claims to do
in contrast to the last review i see on this
based on the good reviews this product got
nothing special to rave about.
wish i would have read reviews before using this on my face
i agree with some of the other reviews
i read great reviews about this mask
i read some great reviews
read about product in prevention
after reading reviews with very similar reactions after just a couple uses
after reading other reviews about the pump
especially because of the many 5-star reviews i saw before purchasing this
absolutely wanted to love it i read a bunch of reviews on it
i read the reviews
i read an article about tata a couple years back
as other reviewers mentioned
it has such great reviews
saw all the amazing reviews it had
i read so many reviews
i read reviews and took a chance.
i hardly ever write bad reviews
great reviews for this product i decided to take the plunge
i just want to address a couple issues i had reading these other reviews:a
after reading all the amazing reviews
at the suggestion of other reviewers
especially reading the instructions
glowing reviews about this bar
first time reviewer here.
however an employee raved about this product to me
i don't know if caudalie has hired people to write possitive comments about this product or not
i read all the reviews of this product
after reading the reviews i thought this sounded like the perfect product
after reading the reviews i tried it
after reading so many great reviews i decided to give this product a try
giving false positive reviews
i waited a few weeks to write my review
the other reviewers that compare this to a primer are not wrong: dimethicone is listed as one of the top ingredients
based on other reviews
i heard someone compare it to glamglo's mud mask
i've read all these reviews
brought this product after many sephora reps raved about it
i will write another review
after reading all the rave reviews
i've read the reviews on sephora as well as a description of the product which seems to promise to reduce the appearance of dark circles
please read all the 1-3 star reviews
i should have read into the ingredients more
when i heard so many people raving about this br
i should've been more skeptic since this product has a ton of mixed reviews
then as others mentioned
when i read that
i never review products but i had to warn people.
i normally don't write reviews
based on all the glowing reviews
ordered because of the reviews
i went through a couple pages of reviews to see if i could find someone who say this dried their skin out
some reviewers complained about the smell
i definitely have to agree with the previous reviewer
considering how it took a burning sensation for me to write a review
watching videos about this
the reviews of this product enticed my to purchase
so after careful reading of many reviews
like others have mentioned
this is an updated version of it
i dont get the positive reviews
i read the reviews
i gave this a try because of all the glowing reviews
after reading the reviews
not sure why this product receives such rave reviews
i saw some reviews about the perfume smell
am not being paid to write this review
enjoy the feedback you get continuously without asking:
i read great reviews about it
after reading the reviews
always give fair reviews
i already wrote a review for this which apparently didn't post
i agree with most of the other reviews
i can't believe reviews are not commenting on the smell
after reading all of the reviews
i don't usually write reviews
since i have purchased this product based on the good reviews i have read
why there are so many glowing reviews
i hate to write this bad review because i swear by first aid beauty's eye cream
read about it in an article that it would work so well for oily skin
she continued to rave about this product
i read great reviews on this
i wonder if all the positive feedbacks are true.
why all the other excellent reviews
people raved about this product
i want to love this because of the reviews
i see most reviews are good
i read such great reviews
which i read afterward
raved about this cream in particular
just lays there like some other reviews said
i guess i should have read more carefully.
based on previous reviews
other reviews have raved about this mask treating pimples
bought after reading so many rave reviews about it
after seeing mostly all positive reviews
as many other reviews stated
after reading all the reviews on several websites
as other reviewers have noted
as noted in other reviews
after reading the reviews wanted to love this cream
as others have mentioned
as other reviewers mentioned
checked out the reviews
before buying it i checked at the reviews
bought this after reading a billion reviews
with glowing reviews to top it all off
i read the reviews
like other reviewers i've read here is this is the 2nd bottle i've bought where the entire new bottle tipped over
i agree with the reviewer that said this mask feels like bugs crawling on your face
other reviewers are correct
he heard great reviews about the line
check my purchase on my sephora app
i got this as a sample which might be something to consider while reading my review
this one came with very high reviews specifically relating to dark circles
i read the reviews about how soft this "stick" cleanser was
like many of the reviewers
after reading reviews now
another reviewer stated this
in my personal opinion
as many reviews state
i read lots of reviews before putting this on my face
i'd write one-stars on all of these if i had time
i wish i could give negative stars.
this is my first negative review.
my more detailed review video is below.
i came across this product based on all the positive reviews from multiple sites
if i had to describe it
i read in another review that if you have really dry skin
i read the ingredients
almost all of the reviews sound like the same scripted person
funny how the bad reviews are the only ones with more personal
just can’t vouch for the results
based on the positive reviews
i will update if so
i tried multiple times because the other reviews say you must use the product exactly as described
i will update with results.
this has had such great reviews
i seem to be the only reviewer so far with a negative outcome with this product
i feel the same way about a couple reviewers.
after reading through a ton of reviews
he gets all the samples and demand his reviews.
gave in depth explanations
i did read a few comments about breakouts
since the majority were great reviews
like other reviews said it is sticky
read the reviews on it so when i went in store to purchase
after reading the reviews on this one
this is my first review of a product
i am only writing it to warn people about the dispenser
the reviews for this br
i saw all the 5-star reviews
because the first review fails to mention this
i feel like the first reviewer has never actually tried the mask
when the review was posted
the only review on that account
following the amazing feedback
reviews this product has
read great reviews about the br
as with other reviews
after reading other reviews
like other reviewers have said
i read the reviews
like many other reviewers
i received this as a 100 point peek at sephora.
i never put something in or on my body that i haven't researched thoroughly
now after reading all the other reviews
i usually check reviews on here
i came to read reviews because after first getting this
guess i'm not the only one has this problem after reading other reviews
considering all the five star reviews
i am so glad to read the other
purchased this because i read so many great reviews on this product
got his thinking it would be gentle based on the reviews
had read rave reviews about this stuff
i wanted so badly to love this oil after reading all the positive reviews
i really wanted to like this one from all the positive reviews
reading all the reviews i thought it would smell amazing
i ordered this because of the great reviews
based on the reviews
ordered this online because of all of the amazing reviews
i saw a lot of positive reviews here
i would still recommend buying it just because out of all the reviews i've read it seems like it works for the majority
after reading all the rave reviews i decided to give this product a try
i also tried the bar soap from herbivore with also raving reviews
based on the reviews
the reviews were good
i heartily second the reviews praising sephora for carrying this bunny-friendly br
the product description should be rewritten
i honestly read all the reviews on this product
though many reviewers have expressed the opposite
based on many raving reviews
this was a let down after reading the reviews.
i really hate to write a negative review
i read the mixed reviews before actually buying this product
the bad reviews were mainly about the smell
thinking that smells are personal opinions
as someone who will try any well reviewed
i see here that there are other reviews about the smell
after reading all rave reviews decided to get this at vib sale
i read so many great reviews about this product
my more detailed review video is below.
...i read to give it 2 weeks to see results.
i don't usually write reviews
this is the first time i write a review at sephora here
i hate writing bad reviews because i typically love everything i buy at sephora
i never write bad reviews
i will finish the bottle then update this review
like someone mentioned below
i've always heard about murad's products through positive reputation
i read reviews that it was drying
the reviews were great
i wish i had the good results others have reported
i don't usually write negative reviews
the super positive reviews must be fake
after reading reviews i want so stoked
read reviews of this cleansing
i expected it to be thicker because of previous reviews
