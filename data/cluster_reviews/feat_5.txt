even my mascara and liner were gone.
rub in circular motions
catch a little something with a q tip/cotton swab
i personally don't like to use cotton rounds/swabs
just a gentle rub melts away liner

i even washed off my makeup forst with a cloth
rinses away so cleanly
as soon as you apply water to wash off the oiliness is gone
it makes my eyes feel all gunky

feels too oily at first
too oily to cleanse whole face
no make up or dirt was found on my toner cotton ball
i like to rub it in with my fingers

then i used the sephora microsmooth baked face powder
this healed my acne in days

my skin feels squeaky clean
clogged pores all over my face
cystic acne on my cheek

obsessed with this mask.
irritated pimples on my cheek
the gel is super sticky
then a rubber like sheet mask on top

it didn't have a strong rubber scent at all
the rubber was pretty thick
the pimples are clearing
the clogged pores that i removed are almost healed
the serum is a thick jelly-like formula which allows me to play with it a little more without it immediately sinking into my skin
i cannot speak to this for oily skin.
my face was puffy
once i peeled the rubber mask which comes in 2 parts
the seaweed rubber mask felt so cooling on my skin after a day out of being in the sun when i was in miami
i look absolutely while wearing this pink rubber mask
the rubber mask rips easily
you smear the gel over your face
then put the rubberized mask on
then the rubber mask
then, the rubber mask goes on.
i love how the rubber mask comes in two parts: for the eyes
peeled off in those areas
unlike the cotton sheet masks
i think i'll stick to the boscia gel sheet masks
my pores were next to invisible
my skin was tingling
i did a thin layer on my face
my surface redness was reduced even after i washed my makeup off that night
i am obsessed with this new rubber mask!
the mask is a little frail
i still punctured a few small holes in the rubber mask
they cant be compared with this rubber mask
these rubber masks are unreal
seriously enjoying the rubberized sheet mask.
some days it’ll be as oily as an oil slick
the condition of my skin
day if i’m more on the oily side: the pore perfecting water gel
possibly the silk or water cream depending on my skin

just right for oily
i slather it on before bed most nights a week

which manifested itself with my nose peeling daily
my nose has the "marble" effect
my t zone is oily skin
this cream keeps my skin from becoming oily
which makes my forehead feel oily in summer
my skin is oily and can get dehydrated.
even though its oily
feels slightly sticky to the touch
when you brush foundation over an area like your nose or sides of nose
you can see a dot of foundation inside each pore
as if i rubbed a line
theres a balled up line of smeared foundation
flakiness on my nose
i am super oily during the summer
typically oily in my t-zone
you won't get a white cast from this cream.
my oily skin was more under control
my skin soaks it up
as a oily skin girl creams aren't typically my best friend
it feels like i'm splashing water on my face.
just enough coconut smell like drinking coconut water
the water cream has a thinner consistency
if you prefer thick creams or have dehydrated skin this cream isn't for you
it melted into my skin when i rubbed it in
i feel like my skin was dunked in a milky
i love that gold plated spoon that comes with the product
lip area get so dry
flaky or oily in the t-zone
mostly oily on my t zone
after trying the tatcha skin mist
meaning when i wash my oily face my skin becomes tight if i use cleansers for "oil"--
for me this was a light moisturizer that absorbed quickly into nothingness
as i put sunscreen on overtop
great since i have oily skin in the summer
using the golden spoon you scoop out the desired amount
which prevents the oils from your fingers from going into the cream
keeps the oily areas matte
my skin is oily/combo
once applied to the skin it becomes watery
my cheeks have been red
which just clung to all my flaky bits
i'd try to exfoliate the flaky bits
i don't see my face getting oily
it's literally the length of a ballpoint pen.
got rid of my blackheads
smoothed out all my pores

my pores were teeny tiny

as well as scribbled with a sharpie permanent marker

i pump it into the palm of my h
it smells like the typical citrus cleanser-- like your washing your face with orange juice
it leaves a squeaky clean feeling afterwards
my skin feels squeaky clean
scrubbed after using this cleanser
love this facial mask.
i start with the sephora collection mud mask
my pores looked cleaner
i rinse mine off since i have sensitive skin
my only complaint is that the paint/ink(?)
it melts right into my skin
how it just melted into my skin without feeling oily
a terrible flare-up of acne or rosacea
seeps into your skin
i love to wear thick
it hydrates instead of drying out your face.
i normally have little texture bumps on my chin
the chin texture bumps have completely disappeared
this mask deep cleans
when i was pregnant i got really bad cystic break outs on my neck
emu oil is amazing on your face
it has helped with the redness of my skin
it instantly moisturized and cleared my skin.
i've got hereditary dark circles
you're not left oily-
redness or clogged pores
cause in my oily- comb skin it was pretty much normal
cystic acne to make matters worse
with dryness in my cheeks
while balancing the oily ones
minor signs of sun damage like sun spots
i put a dab of primer over it
clearing moisturizer for occasional breakouts
my acne scars are fading
i rub three drops in my palms until warmed
it didnt make me oily at all
throughout the day it gets oily
my forehead lined vanished
no oil slick sitting on the surface.
the mask gets a lot of junk out of my pores without damaging my skin
this cleanser transitions from light clay into a very thick lather
no more $92 fresh clay mask for me
at which point became soapy
it brings blackheads to the surface
mother both have had surgery to fix their drooping upper eyelids
smooth my actual eye lids
as i'm aging my lids are getting a little slouchy
i like that it is addressing the upper eyelid- so many eye creams
this eliminates my under eye puffiness while i do my makeup
nighttime underneath my eye cream
which is why i'm puffy
my hooded eyelids are still mature looking
my face is usually oily
has a lot of acne around my forehead
this cleansing oil has the most thick
creates a nice milky lather that removes every trace of makeup on my face
becomes a thicker gel like texture
fine wrinkles under my eyes seem plumper
my eyelashes are longer
i crossed fingers and began using the eye serum.
i only use about 1/2 a pump though to avoid clumping/pilling
lashes-- it conditions them
unfortunately i did noticed some clumping underneath my concealer
massage it from my eyebrows to my under eye
forced the inner tube down with a cuticle stick so there was less air
bad habits of rubbing my eyes
my eye lids are oily
this never burns on application
product isn't exposed to air or sunlight
that would be icing on the cake
concealer to fade or slip
this shaba soaks in without leaving any residue.
puffiness or dark circles around my eyes
my dark circles are from pale thin skin-
on that note i use bareminerals stroke of light concealer- tip- put it on in one stroke- it's liquidy- let it sink in for 1+ min
you won't waist concealer dabbing
the labeling was even smudged all across my bottle
narrow to store upright in a drawer
tingles across your skin
this cleanser is amazing on my oily skin.
grime off my face
this cleanser completely cleans my face without drying it
waterproof makeup, lip liner - everything.
especially my oily nose
don't put lid down or the soap will leak out!
this strips all of the leftover makeup or dirt from the day
i really like this jelly cleanser!
it leaves my normal skin feeling squeaky clean
this jelly soap by far surpasses the face bars
to get off my eye makeup i wet a washcloth
rub the pekee bar on it
squirt a little on your h
otherwise it gets too runny
the dispenser is a bit of a pain
now i am in love with the jelly cleanser
it has not dried my skin out which has happened with other gel/jelly cleaners i have purchased in the past
oil/balm then foaming
bouncy after patting it dry
i really like this jelly cleanser.
great packaging for less mess- no unscrewing a cap
rubbed it overtop black dark eyeshadows
just rubbed it lightly with my fingertip
with one light tissue rub over my h
it was squeaky clean
gentle on eye makeup and skin.
exfoliated my skin in a matter of two minutes
it has tiny beads in it that slightly exfoliate your face
my skin is degreased
leaves my redness at bay
my skin feels squeaky clean
it gets rid of the redness
exfoliated without ever drying it out
my nose can get slightly oily
leaves my skin feeling literally squeaky clean
i just use a towel to dab off any soapy residue from the top after i use it
the ingredients clean without stripping my skin
my skin is very oily in the t zone
the pores on my nose shrunk
the purple has shrunk all my pores around my nose
glowy his skin was after
then add a bit of warm water to exfoliate using circular motions
wash off the mask once it's dried
the gold mask on my cheeks

i am prone to redness there
it does nothing for clogged pores
make sure to layer it on thick
your face will get itchy
have super oily patches
the occasional pimple in my t-zone
nice on the nails and cuticles too.
it really helped with my blemishes and oily skin.
my skin is semi-oily
the baby facial from drunk elephant
have to rub gently after the 15-20 min because it's so strong on the skin
i went on to apply this honey like texture i used a flat foundation brush to paint this on my face
then i rinsed it off gently massaging it off
it turned into this diamond powder scrub i know it does not have diamond powder in it
still make facial expressions
the "beads" a tad harsh
my cheeks are covered in them!
i could feel the mask tingling on face
i developed cystic acne from one face peel 2 years ago
after i rinsed the complexion of my skin was so smooth
baby facial is an excellent face mask that gets rid of dead skin
reduce my acne along my jawline
goes on thick and smooth with a brush.
it took away all the redness of my cheeks
tingles without burning while on 3
no redness or dryness after the fact
anyone who has ever had acne knows that exfoliation of the edges
the lather is ok
then rubbed in circular motions all over my face
when i rinsed it off it came off awesomely
i love love how clean this jelly ball cleanser leaves my face
use the jelly ball to get in there afterwards
this jelly ball formula cuts down on waste
rub the cleanser ball all over your face
any activated charcoal product will smell a little foul
the jelly feels good on the skin
gently rub it on ouor faces
then using my mia brush to lather it up
i store it in a zip lock baggy in my shower
this jelly ball takes off makeup like a dream
when i tested this on the giorgio armani lip magnet
rub it on skin
rub it all over your skin or rub it between your palms
it lathered up into a very light foam.
i normally have oily skin
i've always dreaded washing my face
then use it along with sephora's little $6 pink silicone scrubber
find that almost all clay masks irritate my skin
i swear by the blue mask
purchased the gray clay mask.
i washed it off
i used the green clay mask
irritation that i usually have in the crease of my nose was gone
you don't need a thick layer
use this with the sephora sleeping mask my skin look
the clay mask also had a light baby powder scent
i picked this up because i've had amazing results with the blue algae mask from the sephora collection
i lobe it a lot
like your skin is quenched
stiffness a charcoal mask gives you
from peels to scrubs to masks to wipes
to me it smells like orange flavored cough syrup
hope in a jar with a dab of josie's regular argan oil
glowy without the oily look
not crusty or cakey
i can wear it overnight as a sleeping mask without any clogged pores on my normally troublesome skin
i only need 2-3 spoonful
the mask soaks into your skin
even with my oily skin
this kinda "fluffs" the product up
after washing my face putting this on is like a facial for me
my skin is glowing like i just got a $1000 facial
probably from the oily nature of the mask
the top layer in the jar is kinda oily
then good genes then the watermelon glow mask to seal it all in
my jaw dropped at my skins clarity
i love the little spatula because this mask is runny
goes on like jelly and dries for overnight use.
feels like you are coating your face in angel dew i swear
kind of beading up like weird jelly on my face
the product dries up into a slick layer on the face
clogged pores that looked like skin-toned mini pimples all over my face especially my forehead
felt no stinging or itching

i don't get as oily during the day

hair up in a bun, no makeup.
it hasn't caused any breakouts or clogged pores
i slathered on two dime sized amounts of this all over my face
the mask hydrates dry skin to leave your face soft
to the reviewer saying it pilled into their hair while asleep
i love how it resurfaces the skin gently like that
it gets rid of old dead skin cells
asides from lipgloss or lip balms
when washing off the remaining residue
i used a brush to apply the mask.
this mask sunk right in to my skin leaving no greasy texture to the face
along with healing scars
i also like the little spoon/spatula it comes with
laniege’s water bank sleeping mask to seal everything in
i’d recommend layering thinnest to thickest
it sinks in leaving your sling so silky smooth
hasn't irritated my skin
doesn't have any oily residue
the lactic acid does a great job melting off the top layers of my dull tired skin
sprinkle a few drops onto fingertips
rock my clean face
hyperpigmentation on my cheeks

like freshly mopped work or school cafeteria

peeling the way it was
it absorbs instantly with no oily residue left behind
who doesn't like the feeling of thick cream moisturizers on her face
my forehead wrinkles became more visible
i started noticing more "peach fuzz" or facial hair growing in
i even use it on my upper eyelid to help with dry saggy skin
satified with the reduction of wrinkleson my forehead
gunk of slapping a moisturizer product all over it
it leaves me as soft as a newborn baby.
left a "sticky" texture on my skin for about an hour
flaky around my nose
especially the skin around my lips
the skin around my lips felt very scaly

i slather this lip mask on each night before bed
it also gives my lips a bit of a plump.
there was one lip balm that i've been faithful for years as my holy grails
i exfoliate withe milani lip scrub
unlike the bite mask
as the bite mask is much thicker
i can put a thinner layer of this on my lips
i've also found that blotting my lips at this point
i like to apply a thin layer on my lips during the daytime
for a long time i was using the bite agave mask
however, this lip mask is amazzinggg!
i also appreciate that it comes with a teenie tiny spatula
itchy lips for a long time

i love this lip mask.
i love this lip mask

s down the best lip product for dry lips

bleeding caused them to always be unevenly discolored

not in love with the sponge
it takes off everything even my waterproof lash glue
will not deep clean your pores
lighter more watery formula is less sticky
dark patches around mouth
it goes on oily
a washcloth every morning as well
moisture as of the almond in it
it lathers into a rich milky soap
when you add water it turns milky
it turns into a milky emulsion
super oily in certain places
i tend to stay away from overnight heavy duty hydrating products because they make my skin oily
they leave my skin feeling too sticky/oily
restore some color to my cheeks
the product has a gelatinous texture that i first wasn't crazy about
rinses off easily in the morning
it has the texture of flubber
not oily or greasy
the mask feels light on your skin
after trying the hydra therapy sleep mask for a week my face is noticeably softer without getting oily either
moisturized in a way i hadn't seen before
jello-like texture so there's no oily residue in the morning
so no worries about staining my pillowcase
like a thin jelly or gel.
