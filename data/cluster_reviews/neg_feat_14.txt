you have a sephora store nearby
i love this br
so much son that i would never purchase again
i got this product in a duty-free shop in honalulu
i wore it twice a week as was recommended by my helper at sephora
pretend you're a robot around your house
i tried this twice based off all the glowing reviews i saw of it on youtube
i am obsessed with masks
my friends were hyping me up about this mask
i look like one of those people that dress as statues
i've had a secret yearning for this product for a while
iam a huge fan of glam glow
i found it also left a film
such a fan of first aid beauty
that comes from someone who loves fab
i am a loyalist to fresh products
my friend actually used this
it really worked well for her she felt she saw a difference in her fine lines
i am on the cusp of thirty
or cuz it just works only on beginners for the first few days?
an associate in the store was talking this product up
urged me to buy it
the girl in sephora told me to store this in my fridge
oh lord that cap has been found in my vegetable drawer
great eye cream for a 15-18 year old to use
however as a stressful university student
ed it over to my teen daughter
last time i listen to a very young looking sales person
it was semi-good.
this is not a product for a sleep deprived mama.
i love this br
it is murder if it gets in your eyes.
prefect for bed or going out
i checked the reviews
i left a before & after photo to view.
so for anyone else in my boat
this is my sleeping side
i read every review
this is only my opinion
i got on the computer
i am not talking about satin pilowcases.
so advice from an elder for you younger glams
since i like to wear foundation
since i haven't changed anything else in my skincare regiment
i fell victim to it myself
my husband also used this and felt the same way.
i became curious about the somerville line
this item sits on my vanity screaming to be used
since sephora stopped carrying bliss micro magic
the lady at sephora told me this was "one of her favorites
i read a blog post on how great this was
love the mask version of this
the fact that every employee raved over it
i wish i would have kept my receipt!
i returned it to the store.
it's working in my case.
save yourself the month and $125.
this product left the weirdest film on my face.
i am an avid fan of the argan oil
i gave to my mom who is using it w the milk
it also broke my mom out
was super putted because i heard good things about the br
i followed the directions religiously
while i give kudos to any br
i tried on the am
i am an athlete
i plan on returing.
this wasn't my fav mask
my boyfriend hated it also.
i got this product in my july paly box when i first opened it
it reminds me of some primer from laura mercier
my fave looked beautiful
sadly, i had to return it.
the sephora rep said it codve been the ginger.
my skin recently has bee very clear
i saw this in store
bought it last minute because i had heard such a rave over this br
only to be met with the craziest of breakouts
my friends that work at sephora urged me to not purchase from this br
that i had to pass this one on to a friend
i didn't care for this product in my july box.
i wasn't wowed with this
box, but not a love item.
i got this in my july play box.
i hate checking my bag
i've heard people rave of this product
the driest part of my face
i am 30-years-old and have very oily skin.
i picked this up by accident.
i got it in the murad starter kit
i moved on to another br
it was recommended for me from a lady in sephora
while i adored the masks
i spoke with a sephora employee about this product
i love doing mini-spa nights for myself when i'm stressed
when i redeemed beauty insider points
i patted it in
i am an avid facial mask user
i own tons of them
boscia ones being my favorites
my mom break out alit
i tried their old formulas
i am also a fan of the ingredients.
i took this with me on a recent vacation to a tropical location
i returned this item
i love this br
i decided to fo ahead
i may try it again once i start cleansing again with the drunk elephant juju bar
i gave it to my mom and she enjoyed it a lot.
long background story short
as another reviewer mentioned
i am a licensed cosmetologist
i followed all instructions
a worker recommended it to me
the search for a new br
i then switched to the belif aqua bomb
i am living for it
first couple of uses, i was in love.
i live in co and i had dry skin.
forever a loyal tarte fan
this was a part of her routine
ended up giving it to my mom who likes it
for me it was a big flop
2nd one the same
i read article after article to make sure it wasn't the hype
they will haunt me forever!
first of all, i can't read the tiny instructions.
i intended to leave it plugged in to the outlet in the bathroom
i remember in the beginning the br
i took a photo before i started
im just giving you my humble opinion
even won an award
i am ranking 3 stars in hopes that someone reads this review
you get 30 pairs here so the sephora br
i gave it to my mom
i might recommend this to a friend
a sephora employee directed me to this
when i say pills up
i keep this in the fridge
hated that it was in a pot
sadly i have not see a difference (26 yrs old).
i desperately wanted this to work in place of my beloved nude omega oil that has been discontinued
now i'm that crazy old lady begging nude to bring back the original oil
it absolutely destroyed my skin
i got this as points perk after learning about it from a youtube video
all comments/thoughts are my own
the color that they sent me "05 in the buff
my favorite part of the product
this is best suite a tan person.
i tried it for giggles and it was horrible.
the shimmer it left behind reminds me of the girls i went to elementary school with
it asks to use twice a day
which i wasn't a fan of
dry skin homies, i would skip this one.
i emailed the company
i am a fierce de fan.
i followed the instructions to a t
like other drunk elephant products
i read the reviews
i am a 33 year old female.
when i returned the product the sephora employee even admitted it did not work for her
i am living in the south
i absolutely loved the old formulation of take a deep breath
i just reordered it
the original formula was my all-time favorite.
my friend let me have practically a full jar of this
loved the old formula!
sephora peeps need to double check this.
every time i used the old formula
i miss the old formula!!
i prefer philosophy miracle worker.
will be returning asap.
maybe it was the airplane flight
my spouse on the other h
the girl at sephora said i was doing it properly
the sephora employee told me to buy it
the product left a film
i think the best stuff is the son
this has officially ruined my impression of korres as a company
ma used back in the 70's
i spent $100 on a bottle of 1
as i enter my 40s
i used this bottle faithfully
reminds me of an old lady.
posted a photo of glowing skin
"youtube made me buy it" lol!
it gets on my clothes and all over my bathroom.
it deserves negative star
so this was recommended to me
gave it to my teen daughter who loved it
not made of plastic so the other br
girl i can't st
sunday riley products are either hit or miss for me
not the best of the sunday riley brunch.
i got this in a gift set.
a sephora skin-care employee recommended this to me
pills up like crazy2.
a sephora worker suggested this product to me.
i love the sunday riley line
i quit using it
switched to the foil packet i found the smell to be overwhelmingly granny-ish
clarins, please bring back the old formula!
i moved to florida recently
i agree w/ all the reviews preceding this one
the old packaging was great!
i sent him a picture of the tube.
the associate told him the tube was discontinued
philosophy hope in a jar
this product was recommended to me by a worker
i read the directions
at least not mine
the sales associate told me she swore by this at night
my friend also tried it out for 30 days
having heard all the buzz around the sk-ii br
particularly their commercial in china which works to remove the stigma from being an unmarried woman with a career
was referred this by a sephora consultant
thank god it was just a sample or it'd be returned
maybe last 10 mins i think
trying this at the store?
s felt like it was silk
i know i'm in my mid-40s
i put it in the refrigerator
i tried this product at the recommendation of the kate sommerville rep who was in town at the local sephora demoing the products
i tried it in store
when i got talking to the rep about the ingredients
the rep for the br
it also made me feel like a twilight vampire
this girl was less than helpful to me
definetly left a white cast on my face.
i don't keep a bowl in my bathroom
i could not st
i love mute-tasking product
i saw the actress ha ji won who i am a big fan of demonstrate it online
i really wanted to try this product because it was made by my favorite korean actress ha ji-won
i watched countless videos on how to use it
i did watch the video on youtube on how to use it
i am a huge fan of the tata br
when i saw tati westbrook
on youtube give this a great review
spoiler, it was not.
i've recently moved to socal for college
i saw a few glowing reviews for this product on youtube
any time i've purchased a product that a smaller yt'er/blogger has raved about
review this on youtube
then i went shopping in a mall
none of the results wowed me
unfortunately it made it oiler
i am so devastated
this is the only skin care i changed since the perricone rep sold it to me
if it's someone at the store giving you grief
take a page from my book
this was recommended to me
i gave the product to my mom
something set me odf
this was my first product that i've ever tried from drunk elephant
heard a lot about this br
drunk elephant is my go-to skincare brand.
drunk elephant is a new skincare line
this didn't cause me to break out witch i loved
i love all drunk elephant products.
especially since i live in louisiana
i got a small traveler size as an online promo
i read the reviews
just my friendly opinion.
this was a bust for me.
this is my second disappointment from this br
despite the "nude" tag
if money grew on trees
go to your room lol
it had my face pumping oil like a texas tycoon.
gave it to my mom
i am using my same
i am a 28 year old woman with normal-combo skin
i checked myself once more
it's a no from this combo girl
the sales clerk told me that it would be as a primer also
was in a dream with this product
the lady at the store told me this would be perfect for me
i look at the bottle with regrets
i got this in my october play box
i received this in my october play box
i wanted to try this br
my friend could smell me when i walked in the room
i got this in my october play!
i got this product in my october 2016 sephora play box
i will have to revoke this from my "hearts".
another fail in my october box
but i noticed on beauty blogs and sites.
or a baby right after a bath
don't need to look like i just came from a unicorns birthday party
i didn't notice at 1st my niece did
boy was i glad that i had a sample
it looked like i was st
i am sad that i threw away the original package along with the receipt
i heard a youtuber talking about it
i live in southern louisiana.
i watched a youtuber use and recommend it.
my skin is recovering
i assumed i got a faulty one
the cashier told me to open it just to make sure
got this in my play box in january
i appreciated that it was gentle
thank heavens i had a sample
it took me 20 mins
i read the reviews
bought because i love origins masks
this mask was a waste of money for me
my friend and i used it at the same time.
i will use mine up
this was a youtube made me buy it
am a fan of some of their products
it just doesnt work for me in harsh canadian winters
bought my regular miracle worker that i love
this one was my favorite
like another reviewer said
am in my mid twenties
i am a five-lush-products-at-once kinda girl.
i received this in my august play box
while i enjoyed using it
i mostly associate the br
like boys high school gym locker
doesnt leave any white reside
i heard about this on a youtube video
im a very oily person
i tried this product on a whim
i got this as a replacement for the other sephora-br
like dead skin analogy
i loved the glow under the foundation when i initially applied it
i am a fan of sunday riley’s other products
im almost done with the bottle.
made me believe this was a life saver
it gave me more regrets than my high school relationship
it was recommended for me
i am a fan of some sunday riley products
i love sunday riley
cherish every single sunday riley product
boy i wanted to love this
i love this br
i hate having pieces of fruit on my face
its always been my favorite skin care br
with the old version
i would recommend this for people with aged skin.
it was short lived
i went to my local sephora
the saleswoman recommended this product.
i love that its warming
none have takin there place :-
i liked the warming sensation
farmacy has the cutest packaging
the girl at sephora gave me a very generous sample
you can ask any bee keeper
i love the sleep tight
made me very unimpressed
i used it on my back where i get acne from working out in a sports bra
i just bought this hoping it would be my forever go to acne helper
to spend 5 extra dollars for kate somerville spot treatment
a very lovely sephora employee recommended this
it's one of my holy grails
i just found it in a drawer
i don't agree when br
i returned it in store.
watched the wild card mlb game
it was all hype in my opinion
the salesgirl was so excited about this.
it was new to the store
someone at the store suggested it
i spent $70 on this mask and absolutely hated it.
i made a magnetic mask myself from a video i saw on youtube
this is the messiest waste of time.
i love science and playing with magnets!
i found this was a waste of my time
i followed the instructions
at the recommendation of my esthetician i started trying this- i use
the ph is on the high side
this came in my january play!
when i saw this br
my review keeps being deleted..
it didn't work @ all
i don't know how it worked on that one pale lady in the video
watched videos of people using it etc
my container arrived looking sad
the jury is still out
my mom actually bought this
i read the instructions
am searching for the perfect all in one
i read all the reviews
after hearing it be raved about
been called "a hidden holy grail"
i tried this product in store
the sales lady spoke highly of the br
because i dig the br
for reference, i am 23.
i am not sticking with this br
am currently on the hunt for my favorite eye cream
i picked this up in the rewards bazaar
i picked this from rewards bazaar.
good for bedtime use
i initially wanted to purchase the tiger grass treatment
i looked like an idiot
i heard about this product on youtube
i am already a fair person
i read a review about this product in a magazine
i read the reviews
when i got this, boy did i love it.
it made me look like a ghost
i looked like a vampire
my 14 year old son is using it now
i loved this when i tried it at the store.
the jury is still out on this product for me.
looks cake-y after a few hours
i first want to say that i'm an avid user of dr
after reading the raving reviews
(and ive been using it only on my cheeks).
which is why i gave it 2 stars
this one is not my favorite
i recommend skipping it!
if you want to reminisce the smell of the last time you visited a petting zoo this might be for you
i looked up the name "nilotica" which confirmed my suspicions
ter in my office that cost me a whole $12
my eyes ached while i slept when i used it
it did list alcohol which i am allergic to
i looked like the matchmaker in mulan.
the powder... i was not a fan of.
i am returning this
almost fainted from the perfume
i just wasn't a fan of the two-step system
based on the quiz i took
i gave this product to my husb
i've never been a fan of bar soaps
maybe even one from the drugstore.
the bar part was ok
the bar is my worst nightmare
i am not crazy about the soap bar
im not crazy about the bar soap in this duo
which grosses me out
gave it to my mom
all thoughts are my own
now that im using at home as instructed
i tried this as i love belif moisture bomb
apparently i'm a glutton for punishment so
never straying from my faves again to try
if you've ever been around a metalworking shop
i agree with another reviewer.
i guess sephora is paid by lancer to remove negative ones
this balm is wonderful in the morning before putting in my earrings
gave me a clear highlighter which i loved-
i felt like a disco ball.
i looked like the tin man!
i used it before and after my makeup and omg!!!
so, i go out to run an errand.
i got one for my daughter and she loves it!!
unless you are a 5 year old girl
people still asked me if they're shooting another twilight movie
i am a 100% tarte lover
my 9 year old daughter said it looked like i had been crafting
if you're going to a festival
i received a total glitter bomb
my boyfriend comments that i look like a little girl who just left claires
the skin care is just a flop for me personally
i got this from the rewards bazaar
i regret buying it especially since sephora br
gave 3 stars bc its is cute
my dad struggles with very dark
i am 55 years old and have combination skin.
this ione didn't work for me i 40 years old
the cast member assured me this was better
for someone who is my age
tried it on my h
i can't remember the last time i gave something a one star review
it was not my cup of tea
i love first aid beauty
this was my fav i already went through one bottle
gave them to my bf, he tried it.
he told me he would rather use drug store bar soap on his face
my sister did use it
i ordered the online
wanting to believe dior is your ticket to luxury
i got this item in my play!
this was recommended to me by someone working in sephora
i agree with the other reviewer who said skin looked "starved"
going back to my old favorite.
the woman that helped me raved about this moisturizer
i received this in my april play box
get very tan in summers
that is why i gave it 3 stars :
i am an active person i exercise daily.
bought this because of all the rave reviews
as another reviewer mentioned
i am super disappointed in drunk elephant.
i sadly had to return this to sephora!
see where i st
that my friends has been a game changer for me
i am not an employee of any of the above mentioned
just a nurse who is a product lover.
all my died skin will be gone
t wasn't my trusty nars
it is now july
spoke to someone about this
a worker from sephora recommended this to me
bought this on a whim on one of my layover.
recently moved to a drier climate
my face freaked out
i saw this product on a tv shopping network
was excited since i am a fan of the tidal cream
i love sunday riley
a friend of mine uses this product
): i was so upset!
worked for my friend but not for me.
ceo broke me out so bad
ceo didn't work for me.
which i was shocked by
i forget the br
in my personal opinion
hence the three mentions before as my favorites
i am returning it.
i will be returning this asap!
see if i notice that la mer glow- i wish i had tried this when i lived in the
honestly not until a few years ago while i was living in sydney
a friend asked me to buy some for her
this is not the original cream that inspired the cult following
did nothing listed in description- returned.
am on the fence about it
beeing using it ever since i found this product.
hi i never wrote a review before .
i read other reviews saying it was drying
couldn't leave the bottle st
i gave this one star because this product doesn't contri
that it was cruelty free
my tube has also typo in the description on the back lol
had high hopes for this br
this is my 3rd attempt to write a review.
the lady who recommended this to me got my hopes up
this made me look like a high schooler again
i got this as a sample/gift redeemed with my beauty insider points
this was my least favorite
that is a pet peeve of mine.
i used this with dior forever foundation
i got this with my beauty points.
overall it wasn't my favorite
it wasn't my favorite.
this was recommended to me by a store employee
except make me break out like a teenager right before my best friend's wedding
holy cow does it sting
i am missing my clarins eye cream a lot since purchasing this
then i told my sister to feel my face
i read a review of this somewhere
when i saw the sephora play july video
for some reason my review was deleted.
sadly i returned this product
i love this br
i love this br
i live in michigan where it's cold for a good 8 months out of the year
it started happening a lil after i started to use this
the girls weren't surprised
i spent a good chunk of time reading reviews
try the unicorn one because that's bomb
it should have stayed on ig
it was a different story
my coworker had the same problem
i've seen it all over instagram and youtube.
my husband loves it and i gave it to him.
i follow her on instagram
so sad i returned it
so of course i saw this all over social media
was left in utter disappointment
i tried to use it as a st
worked for my sister who has combo skin
ive followed the instructions
my friend told me about this
hello every skin care br
i am a true beauty junkie.
is known as an "instagram" br
for the love of god, save your money.
after seeing this product used on various youtube videos
still on the hunt for the unicorn.
i saw her use it as a primer in one of her insta videos
after commenting on an instagram post
which im also not a fan of
i lusted after this product for a long time before finally caving
i love the "glowtion" trend
however i couldn't st
i am returning this and going back to my sorbet.
first of all i'm a big boscia fan.
my son kissed me on the cheek
the old one was light
please bring back the old formula!!
overall i was unimpressed
i been using the youth sorbet every single day since i was 17
it's not as light weight as the old one which was a dream for me
it was given to me as a gift from my gr
mother as she knows how much i love
i heard this mask was great from a beauty you guru
so did my teen daughter
that's what the 2nd star is for
now for my dislikes
sephora stop deleting my comments !
which i think defeats the purpose
really was not a fan, returned this product.
firm lover masks to see what the hype was all about
worth the snap chat pic
the sephora workers were raving about it
i got this product because one of the ladies in he store recommended it for hydration
as a late 20s asian female
my dog wouldn't look at me for 40 mins lol
not a miracle worker like everyone says.
here is some info on my skin type for reference: mid-twenties
i would never recommend this to a friend.
i love her older products as well
i will be returning asap.
it was suggested to me at my local store
i absolutely love drunk elephant
which is a pet peeve of mine
let me start by saying i am an avid drunk elephant fan
i love drunk elephant
i am a very big drunk elephant fan
i've used all of the drunk elephant products
i am a huge fan of the entire drunk elephant line- i swear by every other product they make
one by marykay and the other sunday riley.
i read reviews on beautypedia
sephora for the drunk elephant line
i faithfully used the product morning
love several drunk elephant products
i do however love the rest of the drunk elephant line
i love drunk elephant
i love drunk elephant so much
i ordered the beste cleanser as soon as it was available because i thought i'd love it
i've gone back to the juju
not sure if mine was a defect
it leaked all over my medicine cabinet
gave it to my mom to try just in case
she is just now discovering/loving de
i won't complain about the twister cap.
this is a bit of a departure from the drunk elephant cleansing bars
this is one of the first drunk elephant products that i'm not 100% in love with
will be returning asap!
i really wished i had saved my money
one issue is that this br
the tubes looked cute so i ordered them.
i got this through a promo coupon code
which felt like an eternity
i ordered this online
i am keeping this one.
am i the only person who isn't blown away by this?
listen this mask is a social star i get it
i've heard people who love this
save your money ladies
leave this for the teenagers
hearing the sephora consultants rave about it
i used it as a sleeping mask
the check-out lady looked at me like i was nuts
admittedly i ordered this to get on the trend train
good lord it is foul
after loving the watermelon sleeping mask i was hoping this would be my new cleanser
had this product recommended by a friend who works as an esthetician
she swears by this stuff
because it's done wonders for a friend
she looks like an 18 yr
old, but she's actually 34 yrs.
returned it because i couldn't st
i am surprised to see the overwhelming 5 star responses
i am 31 years old with dry skin
i gave it to my husband and he loves it.
my mom got this stuff in some beauty box
for now i am saddened by the results
i passed it along to my mom who loves it.
i ended up giving the sample to my mother.
bought this after attending a sephora class
i am a huge fan of farmacy
when i applied it to my face i couldn't st
from such a wonderful br
i love first aid
i received a 7 day trial of this product from #influencer for my honest opinions
at the end of day 3 my face look like a teenager going through puberty
with a name like that
had kate somerville sold her product the way the sa in store did
i read the instructions
applied it in the car
i should have done more snooping before i wasted $60 on this because once i snooped
i even contacted them about it
they read my message
they did this on facebook
they lost a very loyal customer
its not my favorite
loved the results when i woke up
just got around to trying this as part of my pur of 12
sadly the girl recommended it
i am 50 years old
i read the reviews
then someone asked me if i was sunburned
the reason why the the sales lady recommended it to me was to help with my dark spots
you'll thank me later
after about 30 mins of wearing it
i received this in a black friday gift set
decided to treat myself to this as an early birthday present
am sorry to say it is no where as good as drink elephants c firma
i got mine as a 100 point prize from the rewards
this product was a favorite of mine
when i googled it
i think mine turned
wanted to keep the same br
the scent reminded me of the orange triaminic medicine my mom used to give me as a kid for colds
i’m leaving a crummy 1 star review
i tried the trio.
i read the reviews
ever since i started using this i noticed r
i ended up returning it because it was an expensive paperweight
even though it was a gift.
i didnt break out but my sister did
i followed the directions to the letter
i gave it to my mother who has a dry complexion
thank god i only purchased the travel size one.
a family friend tried the product
when i went to ask her her thoughts on it
i would not recommend this to a friend.
please, please fix the scent.
gave the rest to my niece
i tried this on at a store
boy was i wrong!
i am using it now

my cousin swear by it.
i am someone who has been struggling to find something to help my large pores since i was a teenager
i didn't have a sephora near me
i tossed the reciept
after reading all the glowing reviews
i can't say that it has been a miracle worker
i will keep you posted.
i then gave to to my mom
i am on the fence about this product
the girl talked my ear off about this eye cream i thought it was the real thing
i am returning it.
afer using this religiously i still have baggy
i found that my homemade masks did a better job
my daughter used it in the shower
thought somebody had pooped in the tub
i cannot follow the crowd
defiantly didn't meet my expectations
the bar gets like s
listened to the "bad" right reviews
loved it when i had the sample for my birthday.
as a fan of the br
why i gave 2 stars
this is my nightmare
my sister has it
first of all: if your boyfriend has oily skin
worked at a coffee shop
i didn't even open my br
i will give to a friend
looked like i was a snake
thought it would suit me
my wife loves it
personal preference i suppose.
like i leave the house matte
i got this as the birthday gift
boy do i wish i picked the other option instead
i received this as my birthday gift
i love them as a pair
living in colorado does not help
33 oz for my birthday gift
after research i've learned that sqalane
except in my wallet
as one reviewer said helped
i received this as my vib birthday gift right in time to resurrect my dull
i got the little birthday gift kit that included this serum
photo before on top
this is not your friend
i am thinking about returning it
my bf's sister gave me a tester she took from work
the sales assistant who convinced me to buy this br
bless him for that
i gave mine to a friend.
i read rave reviews about it
mother kept for decoration in her bathroom
then u can put maker over
this product was raved about in several travel blogs that i read
if i was younger
not a winner for me
it also happened to my friend that i gave this too
this is the first thing i had ever tried in this br
it wasn't my favorite
now i am out $55
get the bliss youth as we know it serum to use at night
i returned this junk!
i read the other reviews
kayaking are my hobbies so my after sun is super important to me
this was not my favorite.
the old bottle was nice
i rushed out to buy this after reading great reviews
i also let my boyfriend try it
especially after the rav reviews it received
i couldve return it
after reading the reviews
considering that nothing like benefit's dear john
i went to itch my face
the lady was very helpful
i used this twice the family was in the room
shame on jack black
there was a staff who said they were a murad rep/expert
i am in general a fan of murad.
case in point: this little gem from murad.
as most people are not cursed with death valley for a face
i did some hiking
just buy a tube of banana boat
i put it in storage in case i will go skiing
in my case it was a waist of money
a friend of mine let me try this for a couple of weeks
i only used this once and gave it to my neighbor.
eventually gave it to my boyfriend
i am returning it
know its not a miracle worker
gave it to my boyfriend
live in the northeast
i later found out she was a dermadoctor representative
when i mentioned this
the woman mentioned that the tester was probably just old
at my last sephora store visit
i actually returned this item.
when i told the associate what happened
i realized the lady she grabbed was the dermadoctor rep
i took her recommendation
a sales rep swore to me that she used this product personally
i am going back to my previous br
if i lived closer to sephora
still like the store
ad bags because i have 1 year old that hates sleep
when i was younger
asked a representative to help me
who am i to argue with a makeup goddess?
the girl told me that i'd have "instant" results
heard wonders about it
the sales woman said it would take about 12 mos
my mother was interested
i ran out of eye cream while i was visiting my parents home
buy my mom a new one
i tried this mask many times with my sister
i remember i first bought this when i lived in europe
after reading rave reviews
however my sister did not
i am 72 years old
was coerced into buying by a pushy salesperson who swore results
or did she just swear commission?
went though a skin phase where ptr was my fav
there was no other br
which my aesthetician told me she uses on her ageless-looking skin
it dissapeared into my skin
like another reviewer mentioned
this was just so-so despite the raving reviews from the store
a sephora employee geared me towards this prof
i trusted her advice
she had recommended this
perfect for san diego's year-round warm
i told the woman at sephora i had really dry skin
a lady at sephora recommended i try this because i was also buying a korres face wash
noooo the next day my skin was the driest its ever been in my life i woke up with a million zits
my skin was a nightmare!!!!
i visited sephora store in perimeter mall
i told them my experience before with this item
i bough it last month
she told me to get it
i got this as a gift for my birthday--my mom knows i was curious because all of youtube was abuzz about it
after a friend confirmed that
am a bit of a product junkie
it has not become my hg
while i'm a fan of philosophy in general
my mom told me to start using eye cream
now i am rethinking it
results were the same as if i had used a drugstore br
try eye hope or miracle worker eye cream
ended up giving this to my mom, and she likes it.
the sales clerk suggested it to me.
i returned it to the store
i got this for a 54 yr old man.
it was great on my h
when i returned it i asked the gal to smell it
she said it's normal
i found this soap to leave a film on my face.
i ended up giving it to my dad
it will definetly firm
i brought for my brother
it was the strangest feeling.
my mom originally bought this for herself
used this as a teenager
i am in my 60s
my boyfriend's sister recommended this cream to me
does wonders for her
nevertheless i am returning this product
my mother on the other hand swears by it.
i am 31 years old
it had rave reviews
00 i expected something because drug store br
my son likes it.
i got this for my boyfriend
got this for my husband.
got this for my fiance as a gift.
i got this for my brother who was dealing with some really dry skin
bought this for my man, he didn't like it.
after reading the reviews
hearing close relatives rave about this product
i am a fan of clinique
was using other br
i got this in my july bag.
dear god buy a different face mask people
got this in my july box.
i got this in my july play box.
a friend gave this to me in the past
i received this item as both part of a birthday perk trio
my friend loves it
opening of our neighboring remodeled sephora store
sadly i gave it away to a friend...
not even in my teen years
while in the store i chatted with a sales rep in the store
it still became filmy
i got this for my bf since he has enjoyed the face wash
i've tried this on for myself
as other reviewer was mentioning
there are no complaints from my gf
i did my research
as i'm writing this my eyes r tearing
t was great for traveling
ive tried this 3 nights in a row
i went out for dinner
i returned it to the store.
thought id try this
almost all the products i have tried from this br
but is is legendary?
as an 18 year old girl
i am very unhappy with the service i have received
the sales assistant reassured me
my trust in shop assistants
i liked the packing and pump bottle.
i think as i age
bought something from another br
i'd never had it so bad even when i was a teenager
gave it to my sister
giving all the product to my sister now
this soap left me unimpressed
went back to purity by philosphy
it was a wreck after
my favorite sephora girl ever recommended this
the woman suggested this expensive primer
i looked so many youtube videos before iam buying this product
it brings my died skin obvious
ive been searching for the perfect primer for a long time now
bought one for her
i won't even gift the unused one to my mom
reminds me of a medicine cabinet
i recently found another primer
i'd heard so much about dr
although i am young
loved other korres wild rose products
after reading other reviews i decided that this sounded like it worked
the girl who always does it said she had never seen my pored this clogged
also i keep getting emails to write a review!
at first i didnt know it was this creme
i loved it at the store
am a fair skinned black female
my mom gave me this product to try
my daughter who is 16 likes it
made me look older than i am
spent a month trying to convince myself
i read the reviews
t made me breakout like a pepperoni pizza
my sister had told me to buy the oil
i accidentally purchased this
my bf asked if i was ok because my eyes were so red
if i had no bought this in the bahamas i would return it
i felt as though it left an ily film on my face
thank goodness for sephoras return policy!
my last purchase was from the br
i am 40 yrs old.
i tried this version
i tried the shiseido super revitalizer
especially for my age
reminded me of my gr
i am actually using it in my h
after reading the reviews
i told myself to be patient
cause you grief later on?
i gave it to my mom.
i can't leave my contact info
it just didn't make a difference on my 30 year old baby fine lines
i am already a shiseido night mask diehard
i switched to a different br
this was her suggestion
i got this product because it was recommended by the sales girl that did my mini-facial at sephora
i love this br
the beauty advisor at sephora suggested it because i am oily
this cream was not a winner
it's my go to br
i know this white lucent line works wonderfully on a friend of mine
ew... it was so gross i had to return it.
wish the bottle was not glass
the lady at the shiseido counter convinced me that i'd love it
i look like a clown!!!
i am returning it
my sister tried it
it was recommended to me by a makeup artist on a job i did recently
i read all the reviews on this
i am only 20 years old this ruined my under eye area i am so upset
been using it since april
ed to my breakout i had in the summer
i returned it and bought the clay which i love.
i fell in love with the description
it planted bombs in mine
it was suggested by a sephora employee
a rep from this company used this product on me in store before a makeover
so the sephora lady recommended this for me
i am keeping it
i wanted to give 1 star
a ren representative was there
she laughed at me saying the alcohol was non-drying
she dismissed me again
i told her i have very sensitive eyes
depuffing my eyes after crying
i am a huge ren fan
a sales girl talked me into this product.
i agree with the last reviewer
i originally tried this as part of the best of ren set
wanted to try out ren
wanted to love ren after reading the reviews
very far from my gold st
come on ren, live up to your hype.
it is not a keeper since my purpose was for my oh-almighty blackheads which has haunted me for over a decade
bhs has been such a complex on my self-esteem in my teens
this was recommended to me by a representative at sephora
i would look into another br
please go back to the old packaging !!
has been an absolute nightmare
go back to the old packaging please!
i hate the new pump bottle!
super heavy to pack in the suitcase
bring back the old packaging please!!!
this product was recommended to me by a store clerk
i informed her of my sensitive skin.
you know its a week before the dreaded visit from aunt flo
worse now in my 30s than when i was a teen
i would say it works as well as a drugstore br
never toss the reciept girls.
i adored the old formula
i used mine about 2x a week
which my sister uses
i gave it to a friend with normal skin
now i learnt the lesson
now i learnt the lesson
this is perfect for humid texas summers
i kept hearing rave reviews about clinque
was actually given extra by the in store demo guy
i tried this at the recommendation of a store associate
i got the 90 minute beauty makeover
i am a big fan of the umbrian clay line
so when asking one of sephora's associates for advice
the friend who recommended it to me has had success
i gave it to my sister who has really oily skin
i am breaking out a lot since i started graduate school
made me look old
did nothing for my 30yr old skin.
i brought this home so that my teenage daughters would have a goto at time of "pimple alerts"
i am going to go to store
according to the bottle i have
im not the biggest fan of clinique
i read good reviews about this item
i tried to be patient
of course me being me
now im off to find a new prodict
i am so self conscious about it
murad is spot on with the aha
i am biracial with brown skin
swear by their vinosource s
i couldn't tell a difference in my skin compared to cheaper drug store br
i sadly had to return
this wasn't living up the promise for me
expensive and not a quick miracle worker.
to compare i am a 44 year old
save your money ladies!
replace my beloved proactive bar
it worked miracles for my face
i tried this after someone recommended it to me
definitely not a miracle worker
teen son used this treatment along with the cleanser
that's the only pro.
i asked the sales girl about it
she talked me into this and raved about it.
i returned it to the store
unfortunately bought this product in the store instead of online where i should've read reviews
my friends told me i looked oily all night.
for the price i wasn't awe stricken
this product was recommended to me by a dior rep
i ordered it from sephora
i returned this to the store
i got this because my coworker swears by this.
it's the worst money i've ever spent on a beauty product
a close friend of mine did say my skin was looking better
it is now march
which i've had since i was a child
t would be a tall order
then you have to have plastic surgery
i live on a 40 acre lot
i definitely recommend this to my friend who lives next door
she owns a cabbage farm
she worries about the rainfall
i visited a sephora store to find an eye cream specifically for my dark circles
learned my lesson: read reviews before you buy
when i first saw the container i wasn't amazed.
plus bathroom paper on my face
i gave it away to a friend who wanted it.
i started using this when i got it in my july supscription box
tho i soldiered on
i agree with another review i had read.
maybe it's operator error.
if it burns, it's working, am i right ladies?
particularly while eating my breakfast
the worst thing about it is its disgusting old gr
wish i hadn't wasted 100 pts on this sample.
like my great-grandmother's candle.
still on the search for my favorite
please bring back the old formula
my mother and i spent over $400 each.
tried this product on a recommendation from a sephora clerk
who wants a glass container in the bathroom?
i am hlaf bottle down
none lived up to the hype.
i turned 40 in feb.
i am a firm believer of dr
thank god for sephoras lax return policy!
have enjoyed his book
my mom bought this
she is in her 50's
well i went to vegas for the weekend
i returned this item.
i spent almost $100 on this eye therapy
i read the description over
was very carful about applying it
i am out of the county until november 4th
obvioulsy i returned it.
after hearing all the amazing reviews
jury is still out.
for me it was just another dissapointing snake oil
this was recommended to me by a sephora employee
tried as a suggestion from a sephora consultant
i told her all my products
i've written ole henriksen via the website
ive had to bottle within 2 months go rotten
i returned it to the store.
i read all the rave reviews and ordered this.
which i originally loved
im a guerlain person for a long time.
not on the internet
i went to the store
i told the staff i have sensitive skin
she recommended this one
i read bad reviews of first aid
i decided to go ren
go back to dr jart tiger grass one
it didn't do the deed
no one wants to smell like an old lady except maybe an old lady
i find that this product is not enough for jan/feb on the east coast
i read on the description that it was for normal skin
t must've been an ingredient in this
i returned this item.
one of the sa told me about this product
i tried this as the sephora sales associate raved about it
it does its job like a drugstore br
i wish i had returned it
it has made my h
thank god i got a sample before purchasing
i got this as a gift
i wouldn't recommend this to a friend
i am surprised the jar is so tiny
after receiving it as gift from a girlfriend that is a youtube addict
and my friend says the same thing.
received this as a gift from my sister
this mask worked miracles for his skin
quickly regretted the decision
then i saw the price-- yikes
was hoping it worked as nice as my drugstore br
loved the older version
i read a blog raving about this product
i didn't feel like this produce lived up to its st
then passed it to my less dry sister who loved it
one i received as a gift from my mom
i've also read about ha in magazines and stuff.
this is a waster in my opinion
i felt like i was on vacation
i disliked this product and returned it.
i swore by this cream.
sadly this is my least favorite clinique product.
my face literally drank the cream!
was a huge fan of it
but the smell... dear god.
boy i am disappointed
i cannot walk around with this old lady smell
the verdict is still out
ive tried using it in the morning
this product was recommended to me by the worker at sephora
to each his own i guess.
i let a friend try it
it was recommended for me by a sephora store attendant
someone at sephora recommended this to me.
i waited til i finished this baby off for me to write this review
have used this product everynight
i am returning it.
i am waiting for another br
i used it religiously
ing on my shirt
this was recommended to me
i just bought my 2nd bottle.
the jury is still out
i actually returned this item.
thank god for sephoras great return policy since this cost $75
i tried it as directed
i followed all instructions
boy was i wrong.
it was a different story
gave it to my mom who also hated it
i told her i wanted something lightweight
the sales lady urged me to purchase this
was at local sephora to purchase clarins when kate sommerville rep pushed this product on me
not an agent civilian clothes
thankful sephora has open return policy.
for the price, yo could do better girl.
i gave it to my mother
my daughter was recommended this product at one of your stores as he skin gets dry
a boy was the one who pointed this out to me
returned to the old br
actually today ive returned it
i got this little set with my mia 2
this wash came with my clarisonic mia 2.
i learned from this experience to never buy this br
after reading reviews, i thought i this was it.
i switched to another br
i could get the same results from a drug store br
the lady at sephora recommended it to me
not for dry skin i went on a trip to reno
my t-zone was shiny
bought in january and i liked it.
worst $$$ ive ever spent.
i am in search of something else
this goat milk hasn't helped at all
after success with several other kate somerville products tried this
my 47 year old mom uses it
the girl talked me into this product
i ended up purchasing it after reading so much about it from caroline hirons
gave it to my mom she has a dry skin type
i don't feel it earns the title of 'exfoliating cleanser'
she swayed me over to do the old
i tried it on a lark because i like ks retashpere
i am 42 years old with a good, even complexion.
they suggested this br
seriously i was reading the other reviews
i decided to splurge on this after reading about it on caroline hiron's blog
i used it faithfully
even took before & after pics.
at first i thought i was hormonal
then i saw the damage to my comforter.
which made a greasy dot on my bedroom comforter
being a big fan of the exfolikate
i am a huge kate somerville fan
not worth $65 in my book.
oh well, back to the search
it would be better on my boyfriend
switching back to this br
after getting a demo done on me by an amorepacific rep at sephora
man, was i disappointed.
the fragrance didn't brother me like it did some other people
the nice lady at my sephora suggested this
i felt like a teenager again!
which i die for
when i revisted the ingredients i was shocked
i love the murad br
i could use the old fashion
will be returning this asap
putted this mask on
ful of times so the jury is still out
this coming from a new yorker
i am 35 years old
first of all, i am not a big fan of dr.brandt.
i made my bf use it
i am almost done with the bottle
'm going to rate it a 3 star
after reading the reviews
so im only giving it 3 stars.
this works amazing on my crows feet
now my boyfriend uses it also.
that's still out for the jury
i always considered this br
this is the 2nd perricone product i returned.
i am absolutely irate
usually i'm such a beauty product fiend that i will use every last drop for myself
my self esteem plummeted
will stick to old st
after application i felt like i had a film on my skin
i got this after reading all the rave reviews
i wasn't sure if it was an old sample that i had neglected
the price is unrealistic for this working girl
she is in her late 60s.
run..they are a scam.
was this the original intention?
the sales lady said this would do wonders for my skin
night like the directions stated
i not only was nauseated each time
a little nauseating… like something died on the ocean
i just started reading the book by nicholas perricone
none of the reviewers saying they gagged are exaggerating
gets one star from me
i asked my bf to smell my face
even my kitten woke up from the bedroom
reminded me of expired mayo
and was compelled to write a review!
about 30 mins after i apply it
i am in my late twenties
i am still on a quest to find the best eye cream!
if you're under the age of 25
once i got it on my face, though....ew.
even my boyfriend tried it
i'd heard rave reviews (hello ingrid nilsen!)
i used my points
i told the girl at the store i wanted something to help with my dry eyes
it wasn't a miracle worker as some of the other reviews claim
overall i was unimpressed
then be supper stubborn
a fellow customer saw me st
i love first aid line
i got this as a sample in the winter since i was visiting washington state
i used it religiously
the sephora employee i consulted claimed this one
i wish i had checked the reviews before purchasing
i really wish the skincare "specialists" at my local store were a little more knowledgable
girl at sephora recamended this and....no.
i am a fan of fab
i read the reviews
am sad to say this is the culprit
to the point where i can't st
i can't find my receipt
this is basically baby oil
i originally wanted the $12
i tried almost the entire collection of dr
i tried this after my favorite mattifier was discontinued
i got this for christmas.
jar is ill represented in photo
i got this cream in a trial size along with the miracle worker pads-which i love
i am 57 years old.
i went with clinique's youth surge with spf 15
i wish i had returned.
i guess i should've known by its title
i told him specifically that i use a clarisonic.
e it under my eyes
lesson learned this was not me.
worst money ever spent
this must've been apart of the dr
i should've given this one star for ineffectiveness
an absolute waste of someones time
despite having a printout of my online order showing it was charged to my credit card
am just winging it!..
i am trying to stop aging
the lady had highly advised me about this cream
not cute, i returned this immediately.
yet sometime this product can al
my boyfriend likes using it too!
if you're buying it at 25 yrs old then yes.
the bad news is that
i read the product description
i felt that it didn't really deputy my eyes in the morning
i keep it in the fridge
i kept this in the fridge
it was never published
heard rave reviews on the sephora website so thought of buying this product
i told another associate
the dior rep happened to be at the store
maybe better on a younger woman.
this was recommended to me in the store
00 i thought i hada bargain
my sister gave this to me.
it didn't work for me or my sister patty
it does work for nana
i learned about this product over a youtube review
was originally going to give it to a friend
i am a skincare fanatic
my sister bought this for me as part of a kit.
i gave it to my sister to try
i realized it was the cream
i got a sample of this eye cream at my local sephora after speaking to an associate
wouldn't take the pacifier i offered her with the h
i suspect it is the cream
this was recommended to me
according to the sales girl at sephora
i am returning it.
i decided to soldier on because of perricone's reputation
i went on to write my review
i can't stop laughing about the woman's review who said her "dog thinks she's withholding treats
i spent the entire day with a mayor migrane
i sent an email to dr
this was a gift to a friend.
i prayed no one would notice.
my entire face turned into a pepperoni pizza
bought on a whim because i loved the packaging.
i tried this out in the store on my h
the woman working at sephora recommended this to me
my first review didn't get published
i went back to my trusted br
leaving a shinny film on my skin after application
i love that this is a cruelty free
the sales woman thought this would be a gentle enough br
the lady recommended that i get something with scylic acid in it
im not even exaggerating!
retired it to the back of the vanity
i wish i had returned it
after reading the reviews
never a problem with the former version
was suggested to me by a sephora employee.
the sale's associates were raving about ren
i wish i had returned it
i must have read the description
i tried it on my father
sister after they showered
its just an ok mask as i mentioned before :/ ill use it on my friends lol
although my friends rave about it
man this bums me out.
i wanted a product that was similar to black savage that i had seen on ig
the lady who sold it to me said it was natural
my friend used it too
i tried this because of the excitement of social media on the charcoal masks
my sister love it because she doesn't have a lot of blackheads
i finally got my h
i wish i'd read the reviews before letting the sales girl talk me into this
i even had my sister try it
my teenage daughter's and i did it together.
i waste my money!
my friend also tried it
would have loved it at a sleepover
the woman at sephora suggested this to me.
love his products in general
i recently got a sample of this creme since i am trying to find a new face creme favorite for my skin
have used ole henriksen before
i assumed ole henriksen would have higher st
so i gave it to a friend of mine.
before using this people frequently guessed i was still a teen
so only a year older than my real age at this point lol
i learned my lesson
since i work outdoors
my mom raved about this cream.
'm using it on my h
i saw this on caroline hirons' blog
then i saw someone commented about the shea
i am returning this product to sephora
i liked the bobby brown foundation
which is why i gave it 3 stars
i first tried this product at a friend's house
she tried it out in store with a bb consultant
not good for girls.
considering this cream was almost 60$ cad
the worst creme i have bought by far.
i used this whole bottle
please reply to this message
or check out my youtube channel
i trust their br
this potion i stalked because it looked cool
i am a huge fan of the "extra" line
my room mate whom had oily skin loved it
i would recommend to a friend.
the service was amazing
after reading all the reviews i splurged
unless it was a miracle worker
i am an fan of face oils
i am middle aged
wish i saved that $20
i am a bobbi brown fan
when i read the label
just bought this for my mother for mother's day
after the girl at the store told me how wonderful it was
i almost freaked out in the store
well im in my late 20s
it was like a film attached to my skin
ill use it til its gone
nothing that i have tried from this br
i am giving it 2 stars
still i get the film
i saved my sample of ptr's instant firmx for a special occasion
i got a sample of this as recommended by the sephora employee as my birthday gift
i first used this when i got my free birthday gift
i got this in the birthday gift set with the serum
was happy to see it was the birthday gift this year
ed to my congestion problem
i received this as my birthday gift in february.
when i first received this for my birthday gift
it felt amazing on my skin song with the serum
i received this as part of my birthday gift.
even the worker at sephora saw me with it in my h
the salesperson swore it would change my life
when the bodyguard got discontinued
i am using it onmy neck
on my 2nd bottle
it "pills" like a sweater
i typically am a big fan of sephora br
it's no miracle worker
the sells lady at sephora recommended this
the title speaks for itself.
i am still searching...
bring the old one back please.
i hope another br
since the store only had one jar i also ordered a jar online
i went searching for a comparable
i came on to read the reviews
i could not st
although i am 25 years old.
back to the drawing board for this mom/teacher.
i used it religiously day
wasn't asking for miracles
i am not a sensitive person
my lines disappeared again thank god
this bottle is so dissatisfying it prompted me to write my first review
i tried a tinny sample my mom gave me
my wallet/ pay check doesn't
my eyes burned and teared i can not use it.
i give this a 2.5 stars.
use a jar, wasn't impressed.
one that reminds me of my gr
i gave this to my mother right away.
which in my opinion
i should have listened.
i just couldn't st
the girl told me that i have great skin
like some of the other ladies mentioned
got this for my husband for his large pores.
i am a clinique enthusiast
the area where i used the serum felt like the skin of a newborn child
i am almost done with my 1st bottle
i even tried an experiment
the name escapes me
i gave stars just because i like the br
spoke with a sephora beauty advisor
i think this br
i got this as a christmas gift
from reading the reviews here
i read the reviews
trying this one that was highly recommended to me by a sephora worker
then i looked like a prepubescent teen again
i am 63 years old
my esthetician questioned me as to what products i had used when she saw the condition of my face
i preface this by saying i received the 100pt beauty insider version so not the full version however
bought it at urging of salesperson
being an sf resident i thought i would try this sf-based skincare br
i looked in my car mirror
so of course i freaked out
this one was recommended to me by a sephora rep i trust explicitly
i am going back to the old formula.
since i loved the first one
who is in his mid 40s
i am in my 20's
twice with high hopes because my sister loves it
same in my august beaty box
by in my drawer
when i read the label
bought this for my mother
reminds me of the flayed women fairytale.
omg save your money!
this was a gift for my husb
i read all the reviews
i used my finger
i used all the tips everyone has posted
got this product with the 21st birthday kit.
i got this in the 21st birthday set
thank goodness for sephora's return policy
quick refund to my card
i read the directions.
i read the directions again.
i blame living in the city
i miss the old one!
my sister said she experienced the same thing.
missing the old product :
decided to upgrade to the big bottle because it made my skin bey soft
i realized i wasn't the only one
was directed to this by a salesperson
the lady at sephora suggested this.
i saw another reviewer say it tasted like sharpies
i still tasted sharpies all day
/kids complain about it when kissing me on the cheek
i brought this before going to paris to study aboard in spring
the bottle is adorable
i'll be returning this asap.
a sales associate got me to try this
btw why i gave 2 stars?
the clerk recommended it
i watched a segment on a show with the benefit girls
after hearing a few friends talk about it
bought this product in august
i gave it to my mom to try
i recently tried this product.
ever since i was a kid
a mention on a youtube channel i was watching
thankfully i hired a make-up artist to do my make-up
picked this up after seeing a demo by kate somerville herself
m really disappointed with the dispenser
i am 22 years old
got this on an in store recomendation
ill be returning this
i am guilty of that as well
put aside my sephora br
im surprised by the number of stars this product has earned
i wished i had returned this
e well on my face
it reminds me of the drugstore br
you feel like you're getting scammed
i know what an ounce is
the ladies there kept on recommending it
i've read other raving reviews
boy does it sting
the lady at sephora raved about it
email was written to ole henriksen
maybe the 3rd is the charm?
which was my favorite
the gal at sephora told me that i only needed a very tiny amount
the jury is still out
it actually aged my eyes.
the sephora saleswoman recommended this
being brainwashed by it's void claims
this company should be ashamed.
i used it faithfully morning
i checked in with the friend
i got this product after a sales associate at a sephora store raved about it
i would rate you guy 3 stars
i am middle aged
as per the instructions i am left with a greasy film which is horrible for me
like another reviewer said
i am a huge fan of algenist
i got this after reading all the rave reviews
haha i decided to return it.
i am giving the rest of my sample to my mother
after reading great reviews
after reading the reviews
my friend gave me this as my birthday gift
also, i wasn't a fan of the bottle itself.
i woke up looking like a raisin.
my boyfriend was totally bothered when i slept with this mask on
i gave it to a friend
since i'm still in college
i feel like a vampire from twilight when i put it on my skin
i fell in love
i personally don't have an issue with my undereye area however i gave it to my mom
my boyfriend loves it though
i feel like i'm manhandling it.
i even told her my skin was dry
my cousin suggested this product to me
the woman at sephora recommended it
after reading the reviews
go buy tea tree oil for $4.00 and thank me later.
i remember my friend raving about this treatment gel
saying that this was her holy grail
i am not bowled over by this presults
am a big fan of this br
however, i was lured by the "anti-aging" siren.
sadly it didn't live upto my expectations
i am a huge fan or origins products
i did help but holy cow!!!!!
my sister has dry skin
i messaged as well
this was recommended to me
sephora was good about accepting it
i already had reservations about it
lucky sephora had a great return policy!
will keep hunting for a mask i love
this is the second mask ive tried from origins
the sephora lady told me it would help clear my pores
i followed the instructions
my friend also used it
loved this for years so when i developed burning
read the back of bottles
i am a big fan of origins products
i neglect this area of my face
i switched from fresh to this br
after a friend recommended it
i just couldn't st
like another reviewer mentioned
my face is oiler than before
this was was ok
i am still on the lookout
please please please try fresh rose mask
tried this under recommendation of friends
i am 44 years old with normal to dry skin.
the sephora woman told me to get this product
i love this br
it made me oiler throughout the day
i saw this origins one
i plan on returning asap.
i spot treated it
write the name of the treatment on the baggie
heard great things about this from a colleague
my skin has been acting up recently
i am a big fan of origins products
this was good on my ski
bought this is in a rush since i had dinner reservations
the associate showed me to the touch screen tablet thing
she asked my skin type
it sounded great when i was in the store.
i still found myself with flaky
i spoke with a skin care expert in sephora
who after explaining to her my skin problems
which i love her oil free one
i used this religiously
age defying.....age defying?
im in my mid 20s
the clerk at the store talked me into buying this one
this was recommended to me
this one is not my favorite
inhave tried everything from drug store br
i am now suspecting the same thing
wish that i'd spent the money on a trip to my dermatologist instead
the sephora associate suggested this for me
as someone who loves cake face
as another reviewer posted
my boyfriend likes it.
after one of my best friends raved about this product for months
i accidentally bought the intense version
a salesperson insisted this is what kept her skin youthful
i even went so far as to have my photographer husb
i fall under the 35-44 age group
i tried this in the store
there is also a br
the lady at sephora rec me this product.
i am a faithful dr
mine was too much
when i returned to the store
yes u fell warm first
i like this product's warming
asked her what she have done to her face
she said she started using this cream
my mother both got one of these
it was different for my mother than it was for me
did not made me breakup
i so wanted this to be the cats meow
i am an eye cream junkie
went thru menopause at age 60
this eye gel was given to me as a gift from a dear friend back in december
i am a 32 year old mother of 2 with a dem
maybe i expected miracles after reading the reviews
after 2 jars of this product, i am done.
my mom loves it
on my desk it shall sit!
ive got some white heads
i am a woman on a mission.
don't remember the name
this was so fake
this is my first time writing a review
i first got into this br
i love sleeping masks/products
man oh man i threw it away because i couldn't h
it's no miracle worker either
somehow reminds me of the tibetan mountains
it was recommended by a sales lady
i sadly had to return.
also because skin guru caroline hirons loves it-
used it once and am returning it asap.
that's where the beauty consultant tried it in me
i read all the reviews
following the instructions to a t
i am a diehard fan of exfolikate
the day i was in sephora the rep for kate sommerville was there
this is my last bottle
saw on the drs...thougjt ot was great.
after i read all the reviews
this item took me by surprize
product i am getting out of the bottle
was a smoker for a decade
i am 26 years old
i returned this to the store
smells like fish that died a natural death.
this was recommened by a fashion mag
unless i wake up looking like heidi klum
my boyfriend loves them as well
my boyfriend is currently using the blue label
waist of money for me
truth revealed with spf15 for ages
i am returning it
the salesperson talked me into this one
saved myself some time
it feels like i am wearing a mask
i used it in conjunction with an oh gift set i received for christmas
im stuck at a 3 here
every review i've read since mentions the smell.
kids won't kids me goodnight when i have it on
especially in the humid atlanta summers
i did recently purchase the anthony logistics for men instant fix oil control
said alot of women buy it
i returned it to the store.
the belif is a clear winner
i read the pamphlet that came in the box
my fave is oily
i returned it asap.
i love this br
i returned this item.
i put this in my fridge
i should preface by saying that i am a beauty junkie
had heard about this
it is not a miracle worker
this was my least favorite.
it was short lived
i am a devout omorovicza fan
my skin type: teenager skin
as a student my money is spent sparingly
i love sunday riley for that
kitchen cupboard is not very pleasant while applying
the whole concept behind this br
other days i am indifferent
cult products years ago
i let this one seduce me
"bionic" after reading the reviews here
my boyfriend did not know i was using a new skincare line
he remarked that my crow's feet
purchased the whole sunday riley line
i found a blogger that describes how
riley is cashing in
i gave it three stars because a friend of mine who also has this product says she loves it
i slept with it
gave the product away to a friend
it reminds me of a horse barn
i rated 3 stars because i think i'll give it another shot
bought this with luna oil based on the rave reviews
i did pass this along to my mother
no reading/watching reviews
i took a trip down adolescent lane
i also fell in love with luna
i took it with me on vacation and i regretted it.
back to my old faithful.....
had not tried this br
as a first impression this was not my cup of tea.
i am throughly unimpressed
1 week after i stopped using the ufo clarifying oil
i chose this knowing the br
this is the first sunday riley product i've tried
since i am a big fan of clinique
i stopped using the repairwear uplifting
this is why i gave it 1 star.
i got this from ren fab 4 gift set.
i am dying to finish this bottle just
i must have patted
the girl at sephora convinced me to buy this product instead
i even took photos of my forehead to compare
thank goodness for sephora's return policy.
after reading the reviews
this line isn't one of my fav
finally find my holy grail
i brought this product for my boyfriend
anyway - i'm in my late thirties.
i live in south louisiana
i read the other reviews
leaving for a visit with friends
was not a fan of that
i love the sephora br
remembered i had bought this mask
i loved the description of the product
i am diligent with my skin
sadly it is a return.
told a rep what i had been using
i really had high hopes of this working because the sales associates say its "da bomb"
or 5 star reviews in my case
god forbid i use these in the day time.
i compare it to whiteout
i read other reviews w/ the same complaint
it reminds me of a drugstore brand.
i used this for a couple of years before i educated myself on proper skincare
i ended up giving it to my sister
as i chose it based on another customer saying it "smelled divine"
i know skin care is trial
so visited sephora to try out a serum
for reference, i am a caudalie loyalist.
hunting for a body oil
thought i'd hit the jackpot
my fave felt a burning sensation
it gives me a mortician adams look when i use it
my friend tried as well
having been made with oatmeal
i personally like overnight masks
i love the fab line
vinosource riche was my staple for years
the worker persuaded me to buy this clinique one instead
my mom got this for me a while ago
assumed it wasn't working
wish it had stated that on the website description
i even kept it in the refrigerator as adviced by the lady in sephora
this one just wasn't a keeper.
is in every magazine
watch their youtube video from clinique themselves
i compared it to what i had left of my old bottle
like i mentioned above
even strangers would gush about how beautiful my skin was
i heard great things about all of dr grosses products
all rave reviews that its a gd chance its a bunch of ppl working for the br
i followed this product's instructions to the letter
my aunt gave this to me.
bought this after seeing all the 5 star reviews
after experiencing a massive breakout from kate somerville eradikate mask i was guided towards this product by an associate
this isn't a miracle worker
i found it pleasant after that
as i've reached my 30s
the sephora consultant guided me to a representative from the dr
this was recommended to me by a sephora sa
but my coworkers loves this one.
i am disappointed my skin revolted!!
glowing corpse bride look
the sales lady recommended this br
it worked for my friend and she loved it.
the salesperson was really convincing
i regret listening to her
thats the truth lady.
i just had to post based on the magic people rave it performs
it was a piece of junk.
patiently answering all my questions
so after reading reviews here
this was returned (thank you, sephora!
my motto is if it works
it is now march
then i noticed that korres had been acquired by johnson
still i was blinded for hours
she likes the results
i enjoyed that it has a pump.
thought i would give western skincare another chance
i loved that it had no sent
i took a screw driver
i just destroyed it
for my 50+ yr old mother
i felt like i was wearing a mask
i am not alone
absolutely destroyed my face
i am returning these asap
after reading reviews online
talking to sephora staff in the store
the title of my review says it all.
since i've raised two kids
been a nurse most of my life
my face was devastated with breakouts
and i am no baby!
well girl das expensive
from now on ill stick with my dr br
sensation that others have spoken about
someone else in this comments forum mentioned that the company had been sold
i am bummed as i have bought at least 30 of these since it launched
i am a huge fan of genifique
i am in my 60's.
i used 100 of my beauty insider points on this
i checked lancôme website for video instructions.
i got this as a gift
have mixed feelings about it
i will be taking it back to the lady who sold it to me
i am still using
then i read the instructions
i find that i go back to my old
i gave it to my mother to use
she is in her early 60's
i am now on the hunt for that "fountain of youth" miracle product
tried to find it on youtube.
have wanted to try this br
i originally bought this for my mom
my mom uses this one
the sales rep had told me that i don't need
the verdict is in
sales person told me to get this instead
must've forgotten that at time of purchase.
why ru deleting my reviews??
nicole guerrero herself even said this has helped flatten her blemishes
i loved the old formula
the old mad didn't
ruined my foundation application
so sad another failure.
in lieu of revisiting my teen years i decided it was time to give it up
had my colleagues also smell it she said the same thing
even my husband said that my skin was glowing!
i didn't even have them as a teenager.
i am 35 years old
the nj store where i returned it does not carry ren
i am always on the lookout for a good eye treatment
i gave it to my friend
i am considering returning it
this was recommended to me by sephora employee
my boyfriend even commented
then i fought i was allergic to something in my hotel room
the pics look the same
i am only newly 29
i will be returning asap
it's dried out my underage area
i religiously put it on everyday
or i am tricked into thinking it does
a sales woman at the store recommended this to help with my under-eye bags
i loved the tube
bought this for my mother.
a couple weeks before my wedding (feb.
the sales lady recommended this product for me
i am however a huge kate fan
i got this cream from redeeming the beauty insider point
after application i would feel a weird sensation
it would leave a film
as a very busy person
i will be returning this product asap.
if i wore this alone
which another reviewer mentioned
found that it just couldn't st
initially i thought it was my bb cream
i just had to write a review
hate leaving negative comments or reviews
even more so than when i worked nightshift
i used it faithfully
i wasted my time and money.
i think this is just a scam.
i wrote a review last week about how horrible this products is
my review got deleted
then again i am a mother of a 2
however this was murder on my sensitive eyes.
i am going to be 30 years old
idk what to call the container
please tell dior to bring back the old version
i loved my first container
sort of like a treasure chest.
about a month ago i reorganized my beauty products into a drawer
my mom said the last pimple
bump on her face was when she was a young girl
i've used clinique since college
*as* i was using this
i returned my jar today.
have friends that work at the stores
i tried this in store
my age group:30s / season tested: dead of summer in texas
which i'm supper disappointed about
an old woman's dusty bedroom
it got all over my bedding while i slept
didn't leave a white film
tried this out after a salesperson recommended it
even during my teenage years when all my friends were battling acne
i am a huge boscia fan
i wish i had taken pictures to upload
radiance since i'm getting married in a few months
i found that it made my skin feel even oiler
onto my car seat
i am now on my 3rd bottle
" so said the sephora associate
i found that my mother has purchased this product just recently
i am a big fans of rose facial products
this was not a homerun for me.
i really like rose
i am travelling for work
i am a huge fresh fan
the sales associate talked me into purchasing this one in it's place
i regret listening to her
thought it was campfire from the outside
i looked like i should apply to charlie's chocolate factory
ps the smell is like an orange bomb exploded on your face
my daughter gave me this for christmas
am a lover of the truth serum
i wish i hadn't let the saleswoman talk me into this
i gave this product a one star review because
this one didn't impress.
if you're an ole henriksen lover like me
wish i knew that this was a self tanner when i got the sample
my only clue from the packet was that it said to wash h
like other reviewers i used the sample before reading here that it's a self tanner
this was almost unbearable to me
used this without realizing this was a self tanner
i also did not realize this was a self tanner
found out about the self tanner piece
this time even my child asked what was that smell
then at dinner with friends
i am returning this asap!!
my cousin is a dermatologist
i love this br
i will try smashbox photo finish.
i am a fan of the algenist product line.
i told the sephora sales associate about it
i got a bottle of this
i wanted to finish the bottle before submitting my review
the emperor has no clothes, as they say.
i agree with the other reviewer- stay away!
i gave it to my mom and she loved it.
i looked like i had been in the kitchen all day long frying chicken
my nose is the worst offender for being oily.
tried it on my hand in store and loved it!
when i ordered online
so she advised me to try photo plasma
i don't use mine
although it was lovely when i applied
i live in a very warm
am a fan of this particular br
spoke with a woman who recommended this product i explained i have rather dry skin
the sell woman told me a serum was not necessary.
the photo plasma is getting returned.
my sister who's in her 30s and swears by it.
i heard amazing reviews on this item.
it irritated my skin and i bloke out.
i am 37 years old.
i followed the instructions
i got this item in my sephora play
bought this because of the glowing
as a lover of anything rosy
i followed the instructions
from my personal experience
i checked other reviews
i keep trying this br
i took a trip to the mountains
i am returning this product asap
recently bought this cleanser on a whim because i heard such great things about this br
it didn't suit me
went back to sunday riley cleanser which is absolutely amazing
i will give it to a friend to test
my first review.....i just had to write a review.
appearance it bottle seems what a luxury br
i heard so much about the tata harper line
just waiting to crash off my ledge in my shower
the jury is still out on this one.
had wanted to try the br
sa in store raved about it
i really wanted to like this after hearing rave reviews from some prominent skincare bloggers
i am a fan of a few other products from the line
this is an intensely fragranced accident waiting to happen
i hate to be this brutal in a review
this was recommended to me by one of the girls at sephora
tried this in store
she did some of her homework
she studied a little bit for finals
even tried chilling it in the fridge
was shocked that this happened
i never had experienced this before with my ole henriksens cleanser
the sales lady recommended this for me
it's claim of anti aging is far fetched.
overwhelming l made me breakout
i tried it at a local sephora.
she during 40s-50s
i am finishing up my second bottle but nada!
im about to finish my first bottle of this product
the jury is still out
for the price i was actually praying
f you were a newbie like me
when i realized the price as well, i was shocked.
bought this in korea years ago
it has done absolutely nothing for my underage area
was loyal to it for years
everyone raves about it
i think because it doubles as a mask
now i have to repair what's been damaged
i tried something similar from another that br
i am returning this product
i contacted sephora about my situation
i've since found another br
they are a lazy girl's best friend.
was very excited to use it after my dermatologist appointment
i like to apply some foundation on my face before i leave the dr office
i am obsessed with face masks
t lived on the shelf for a while
glowing write ups in magazines
my mom has used this for years
i'll probably give it away to a friend
at the suggestion of an employee
i switched when i realised i was looking 10 years older
my face is looking my age
figured clinique was a safe bet
id never buy again
made me breakout profusely
i applied some to my boyfriend
i probably would have loved this when i was in my early twenties
i got this as a gift
i also asked my co-worker who tried it
the lady swore by this
at first i thought this cream was a god-sent
a worker told me this one was better for younger skin
i just got it in the mail
honestly burns the worst i've ever felt
i tried this product because it was recommended to me by a sephora representative
i read the reviews
as another reviewer admitted
i religiously mask each week
sephora has soo many different
i liked the muslim cloth
the cloth is a joke.
my skin was a wreck
am i missing something?
i love most of the eve lom products in the travel kit that i tried
it reminds me of horse stalls
i love this br
i got my hubby to crack the lid
i am still relatively young
maybe it was just mine?
i am the biggest supporter of lancôme
i got this as part of a huge gift from my family.
it was in my wishlist
was not expecting a miracle
i asked store associate about smaller bottle
i am returning this product asap.
i got a deluxe sample of this after the sales lady raved about it on herself
i am 50 years old
i tried this cleanser at a friends house
pick up a tub of the same stuff at the grocery store
go read the reviews on that
the feeling was short lived
wasn't wowed after first use
i read rave reviews about this product.
got this product with my free birthday gift.
the rep talked me into this at the vib event.
view more of carol hirons in youtube she gives awesome beauty advice love her
it came highly recommended by the ba at the store
i tried wearing foundation
i will return to my nude oil
she said it "transformed" her own skin.
i learned my lesson
passed this along to a friend
she swore it was a holy grail product.
after reading the amazing reviews i thought this was going to be my holy grail serum along with the cream
boy was i wrong
it worked amazingly on my mom
so i gave it to a friend.
on my last visit a representative from kate somerville was in sephora
thank goodness for the other reviewer who indicated her sensitive skin's reaction
the gal who sold me in it said it was the best product for dark spots
i am switching back to the orginal gentle cleasner by shiseido
i am sad to leave this br
i love this br
i read all of the rave reviews
the container is very embarrasing
on wendy williams show they had deals on there
after reading reviews chose this
i am staying hopeful
i used it faithfully morning
they both agreed that dr
i am in my early twenties.
this was because of the people i spoke to
a sephora employee recommended it to me
i told myself if drug store was so great
so i started my search.
reminded me of my grandmothers rose perfume.
the former was amazing.
not my fave product from kate sommerville
a sephora employee recommended it to me
tried this on my h
i ended up washing my face again with my trusty drugstore br
it's definitely a dry-girls best friend though.
it's just sitting in my cupboard
this one was a flop for me
this project didn't work for me
like another reviewer below me
i am a huge fan of
i work from home
sadly, i had to return it.
gave it to a friend to try
disappointed in this product from a br
cakes under make up
fyi: when i see the word "luxurious" in descriptions-- to me
was recommended by a woman at sephora
the girls at the store suggested this product
mind you, i just did it 5 mins ago.
was impressed with fab
was purchased because origins black mask
i used it religiously
i am not a fan of peel-off masks in general
after a swim in the dead sea
the most my sister
it was the skin rescue
i will now be working overtime to nurse my skin back to health
when i saw i was getting this in my july play!
i used as instructed
i'll pass it to my sister
i love the idea of sleeping with a mask on
i've shopped with sephora for years
the former i could live with.
not a cream i use when the boyfriend is in town
it reminded me of a bad self-tanner.
i love the entire line of black tea
as someone who was born with hereditary dark circles
i am a 32 year product junkie.
a sephora employee talked me into this cream.
i am 38yrs old
but i wasn't wowed by it at all.
i checked the basket
i actually had a friend ask if i had stopped using eye cream
i don't like the association of "milk" on my face
a worker in the store convinced me to buy this after i asked her opinion on face lotions
the bottle is terrible
which is why i gave it 2 stars
just after only one use of this argan milk it turns me to a night mare
i patted my face
gave it to my mom who is using it
as i recently just purchased a value set of her infamous argan oil
on wednesday a makeup artist was asking why my skin was so dry
ive tried the sephora mask before the pink one
claimed it was amazing
i cried at the sight of my skin.
i'd say this is my least favorite glamglow mask.
when i mentioned it to a sephora rep they laughed it off
my boyfriend casually mentioned to me yesterday that my skin looked bad
in my own opinion
i hope my non-glowing review won't be mysteriously deleted
apparently im the only one who thinks that
that's why i'm deducting two stars here
i expected a choir of angels to sing praises of my "superior"
she recommended this product for me
despite it being from ren
first one was a flop
oh my god in heaven
id like to say that ive never written a product review before
after the recommendation of a few you tube gurus
thank goodness sephora has such a generous return policy
i really wanted to like this product after hearing a popular makeup artist rave about it
i tried this in the store
i tried it in the store
i swiped it on my h
saw a review of this on youtube
thought this was going to be the holy grail of pore perfecters
this baby is tiny
it's by far my favorite br
i will go back to my other department store br
?i'm returning to the store to inquire further.
frankly there is a drugstore br
i contacted customer service
i heard of ren pump horror stories
i saw this version advertised
i suppose i should've taken a hint by the name "youth" moisturizer
her praises for this mask
the very nice sales gals in the store suggested this mask
after reading the description
this bottle was a waste of money
i'd had great luck with dr
i love this br
she tried it on me
the fab rep was in the store.
fab has me covered!
i loved this product when i had a beauty consultant use it on me in the store
i am an eye product junkie
i love fab in general
ive only used it twice
i'll hulk it out for 15-20 minutes
i did this mask before my birthday dinner.
i agree with the previous reviewer.
an e-mail later
sorry if i misspelled this
i am a huge fan of ren products
i picked this up during the vib sale as a "treat yo self" purchase after seeing rave reviews about it
wish i had returned it.
it was recommended to me by one of the staff at sephora
i read some reviews before
if you're a teen of the 80s
it looks like it was deleted
my sister has oily skin
anyway i remembered the face wash.
as i've been using it i often find myself reading the massive wall of text on the bottle
i know this br
i've recently changed over to another ptr cleanser which i am loving
i got a sample and it cried me out.
this is the first kate somerville product that i have tried
i am crossing my fingers
this is just my opinion :)
wish i actually lived in the city
i also wasn't a big fan of the dropper.
lesson to me, read the label.
i am disappointed in the perricone br
wallet will thank you for it
not a creme as i had imagined
i am a rose lover
am i missing it?
im in my early 30s
yay for sephora's amazing return policy!
i love the idea of tata harper
learned my lesson with this.
i am a fan of fresh product
it looked like i had been crying.
winters in the midwest gets cold
a half before my bridal shower
i regret spending that 7
i agreed it was very slimy
got much deeper i thought than drug store br
then the woman at checkout raved about it
i read the bad reviews
i followed the instructions
i fall in the hate camp.
i read the reviews
maybe i misunderstood the directions
i am giving this product 3 stars.
mine wasn't burning like others
this is my least favorite mask from glamglow
i love this br
this is a def first for me.
this was recommended to me by an employee
i've tried everyone of the br
while i am a huge fan of glamglow thirsty mud
the sephora employee recommended this after i inquired about a serum for my oily
as a woman entering my 30s
i feel like i was cheated out of almost a month's usage
one more star deducted because kate somerville knows the container doesn't dispense correctly
thankful for sephora's no questions asked return policy
banging about is no my fav part of my night time regime
i can't speak to its lifting
the woman who recommended it told me it was for day wearing
i got a little jar of this as a gift from a friend for xmas
unfortunately i am a side sleeper
ha it feels good on
i accidently purchased this product thinking it was the eye cream
she raved about it
i will be returning it to my local sephora store.
i gave it to a friend who loves it-
i used my reward points on the kate sommerville website to purchase this
it definitely gives off old lady vibes.
it's been about 10 mins
gave it to my mom
i wish this was in a jar
i wanted to rekindle my love affair with clinique products
told her my age
she bought some, as did another woman.
i would have said meat from a bbq
another reviewer said bacon bits
when i remembered i have a sample bottle
as a huge clinique fan
boy was it a mistake
i love the pump for traveling
got in in december
in the old-style pump
i felt like i was living in a deep forest
i took weekly pictures
i returned it to the store.
the "skin guru" in my local sephora recommended this
i would not recommend this product to a friend
i followed the instructions
dk what went wrong
i trashed it immediately
i just got mine
i used this once and gagged.
loved the results after one use
i learned my lesson
unfortunately right before getting maternity pictures done this weekend… have to cancel
gross film on my face
read all the rave reviews
my friend recommended this cream to me
i personally use it on rare occasions
i am usually a sheiseido fan.
was so excited since its such a reputed br
i even had a friend
waste of 200 points in my opinion
it was a bit of a horror show
i used this religiously
i recommended this product to my mother who is 43
otherwise i would pass it to my mom
it didn't boos my skin
i am finishing the bottle
my friends like it
i did my homework
why it garnered 3 stars from this dry faced girl
the worker spoke highly of it
i then had my husband try it .
it reminds me of a dentist office.
i heard rave reviews about this product
that freaked me out.
i gave it to my mother.
i only changed this is my a.m.
i used this religiously
then i opened a br
l was shocked to see l still had makeup
was shocked to see foundation
i read all of the reviews
neither my teenage daughter or i liked this.
i wanted to love this product based on its youtube presence
i am a one-step person
i am 2/3 of the bottle in
i am 20 years old
the best ever br
i live in the midwest
plus my mother said i had bags
the woman in sephora ran to this over priced product
i got this for christmas.
i trust my gal at sephora
as the title says
this was recommended to me.
since my friend likes it i'll give it to her.
ive been constantly on the hunt for something that works
i got it in early december
no email or social media replies
the chat seems to always be unavailable
i didn't read that in the description on sephora
a sephora employee recommended it to me
i am in my late 20's and a huge skin care junkie.
i read the reviews of this
other reviewers raved about this
fell for the fabulous reviews
i personally found the dr
even my mom noticed when i went back home
i wish i hadn't waited so long
back to my old drugstore stand by.
wishing i had returned this.
god forbid i wash my face
i gave it to my mom to use maybe it would work better on a 52 year old
it is off putting to my bf at bedtime too.
it'd have to look like the plastic-surgeon fairy came during the night in order for me to buy it
the sa at sephora raved too
not really a winner in my book.
i am a huge fresh fan
for one it just sits on ur skin
when i went to return this the lady told me i wasn't using it properly
boy does it make me breakout
at first i thought it was my diet
i used the sample 10 days before my wedding--i know
i get married in 3 days
my best advice is to stay out of the sun
i miss crease release!
i gave it a shot as i'm not a surgery person
but it's not a miracle worker.
i gave it to my mom
was going to give to my mother to try
my mother had recently started a new wrinkle product
this has to be mentioned i get botox for my crows feet every 4 months
my biggest complaint is the bottle!!
i tried this very expensive anti wrinkle treatment for the recommended time the saleslady gave me
stop myself from purchasing
it absolutely destroyed my skin.
have been dealing with acne since i was in 8th grade
no that's a big no i've had this mask since december started to really use it in january-present
i got this while i was out of town for vacation.
figured the washer would be great
i read the reviews
am so sad to have this gorgeous green bottle sitting on my bathroom counter
that i dread using
god it made me nauseous
a waste of money in my opinion.
i read an article about tata a couple years back
my skin is making me look like a middle-aged teenager
i am a lover of philosophy product
i am a 29 year old female.

i sadly returned it
which i was expecting
sold to me by a sephora employee who swore this was the holy grail of holy grail products

i love the drunk elephant line
i got my mini juju bar from the travel size duo.
when my mom tried it she said it was too harsh for her oily skin
was told by a sephora salesperson it had a good lather
it ruined my self esteem... returned it
glowing reviews about this bar

my 33 yr old daughter tried caudalie
however an employee raved about this product to me
why am i spending $99 to look older?
thank heavens it was a sample!
i used this religiously
benefit it one of my very faves
if you are a teenager
watch my video for pros
a few sephora employees i talked to felt the same
she definitely convinced me that the little iron was the cutest thing in the world
after reading the reviews i tried it
for ne it has worked great that way
the other was majorette
haven't been traveling with it
a sephora employee recommended this for me since i mentioned that i have dry skin
compared with the white tea skin guardian from origins
this was the least favorite of the bunch
was left extremely underwhelmed
i think i fell victim to marketing regarding this mask
has buzz words like "24k"
restored a 'glow' like the description says
dates just to get that goddess glow
got this in the holiday black and gold kit.
i am 26 years of age
i learned this after i used all of this
she was also disappointed by the mask
netflix with my gals
i love the gold
bought this around christmas time 2014
i used faithfully for awhile.
i heard someone compare it to glamglo's mud mask
the girl at the store recommended this one for my t-zone oiliness

best for a younger person
love many of her products
my mom loves this wash
am scared to use any cleanser by this br
i am returning my bottle

the sales person talked me into it--i have buyers remorse

which is what the sales person told me it was
i used it religiously am
after reading all the rave reviews

originally bought glamglow for my teenage daughter's acne
sadly i had to give this to a friend

it did the same to her
i chose this product bc an in store beauty advisor suggested it

in the home of a person who doesn't bathe
like a very old woman.
if you want your sixteen year old peaches
a sephora employee brought this one to my attention
so disappointed because the saleswoman in sephora raved about it
influenced me to buy it

who was born in 1910
i love the perricone br
i would not recommend this to my friends or family
i am on the fence about returning it
i owe that to healthy habits
i used this after getting a sample from the associate who swears by this
believe i've earned bragging rights
i'll go back to my drugstore brand.
grew up in hawaii in the 60's
who ever said it was ... they're lying.
even the photos on the box seem bogus.
i remember trying the pink
it's made in china?
i tried the pearl one as well
i got this as part of a gift from a friend
i told an employee at sephora my issue with under eye bags
was not only shocked to see alcohol
later i realized that duh
just can’t vouch for the results

that's coming from a person who is heavy h
i tried this alone
or any woman that is on the struggle bus to not sleeping a lot/heriditary under eye problems
i asked for sephora gift certificates for christmas
it's being returned asap.
it worked for my sister

this is the worst thing i ever bought from sephora
the lady at sephora recommended this
i searched the site for night moisturizer in ole henriksen line
the lady from a sephora store recommended this product
that is my only complaint.
when it comes to eye creams my boyfriend is my guinea pig
i used it one day when i had fresh cleansed kin
was grossed out with how old
a l'occitane rep was in the store so she tried some products on me
love many other products from this br
would not recommend to friends
it didn't live up to its famous counterpart.
i gave it 2 stars just for the presentation
my friend has been brainwashing me for a long time how great tatcha product is
i saw this product online
my biggest gripe is the bottle.
i should've listened to others with regards to the ridiculous cap
dumped it in my h
i am only writing it to warn people about the dispenser
i returned one bottle to a sephora store
the reviews for this br
i saw all the 5-star reviews
i even put it in freezer
when the review was posted

omg the worst experience
the smell is also assaulting
i got this for my beauty insider points
i love my friends enough to throw it in the trash
youth preserve to name a few
i used one whole bottle of this
a sephora worker recommended i try this
this product has been causing a ruckus in just about every fall fashion magazine by editors
it is good for teenagers
why do you take away my joy of taking a bath?
for a while i'd been wanting to buy from herbivore
sorry lapis, back you went.
in the past i've tried vintner's daughter
now i wish i hadn't been so stubborn headed
i am an oil queen.
i really liked the first bottle of lapis that i ordered
thank you sephora for your gracious return policy
repurchased the trusty phoenix oil
if trying out this br
it reminded me of c
i also tried the bar soap from herbivore with also raving reviews
k thought this would work
i felt it was a waste of money
i heartily second the reviews praising sephora for carrying this bunny-friendly br
i played with this in the store
it's not a miracle worker.

first things first - the dropper is genius.

i gave this to my husb
this is a regretful purchase.
i am a mask addict
i've loved nearly everything from the korean skin care br
have been an avid fan
i am now trying a korres black pine product.
i received this in my august play box
the lady at the store recommended this because she said she used it
apparently from birth control
i used it religiously
i spoke to a sephora rep who insisted products with vita-c were best
i am a beauty product junkie
a sephora rep directed me to this product.
i am not a sun lover
this was recommended at a store in nyc by a clerk who appeared knowledgeable
i got this as a gift
i am one of them
like someone mentioned below
purchased this after being referred to it by a staff member
even though i had reservations
felt like crocodile skin.
i wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy.
asked an employee to help me pick out a cleanser
it murdered my skin.
wish i hadn't purchased the kit.
more hatred towards this br
it make my fave brakeup every were
thought this was a great new br
sephora girl recommended this based on others i've tried that did nothing
i kind of bought into the sunday riley hype

huge disappointment, will be returning it asap.
