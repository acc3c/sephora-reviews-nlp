the first week was fine.
using it 2ish weeks
have been using it for about a week now
used them over the course of a week
i feel like this could easily last me nearly six months
as like 2 hours after i applied it
been using this about a month
there was a film even hours after i applied it.
i used this until the last drop
my face started burning after a couple of minutes of having it on
stayed red for a few hours
use the fresh clay mask one or two times a week
it made my face really oily for the next couple of days after i used it
i didn't see much difference after using it twice a week for a month
i ran out in about a month after using only 1-2 times a week
i used this three times
i returned this after that.
effects last for a very short amount of time
for a mask i'd expect more than just a half day boost
it will last a long time
used for a little over a week
even after using this stuff for a month
happy for the first few days
the bumps went away after a few days
have used it 3 to 4 times a week without seeing even results
decided to try it again last month
it did smooth my skin somewhat after a few days use
bought another one a few weeks ago
did the formula change in the last few months?
i used the product for a week
that one is miles better than this one
after using it several times for a couple weeks
i used this for over 2 weeks hoping that it would rescue my skin
for the summer time
it just felt extremely gross after a couple of hours
i've used it for a few weeks
have been wearing this for about a 6 weeks
it lasted over 3 weeks of daily/twice daily use
i used this for a couple of weeks
i used this for several weeks with no difference.
applied this for about three weeks
i wish i had spent my hundred dollars on something else
after two weeks used this product
i used the product for 2-3 weeks twice a day
i tried this product for a few weeks.
i did use this for a couple of times
it only works for one or two hours
used this product for months
i used this eye cream for about a week
seems to wear away a few hours after i apply
30-45 minutes later i would have to reapply before putting on my makeup
i used it for a couple days for my eyes
this product made my eyes ten times worse
used it for only 3 days
i used it for about 1 week
i returned it after 2 weeks or so.
only used it twice
the results don't last
have used 3 times a week as directed for weeks
after my first use
applied it everyday for 7 days
i've used religiously over the last few weeks
i saw no change in my skin at all over two weeks of use
going to use for a week
i tried this mask nightly for about 6 weeks
have been using this product now for about 3-4 weeks
it takes weeks to often notice results
within a few hours you are right back where you were
the benefits last longer than about 5-6 hours
i gave it a full week before returning.
it did nothing for me after a week.
tried it out for a few more days
i used this product for 30 days
i used the product for a few weeks
have been using it for years
i used it a few times
no long term changes after a month of daily use
after using this for 3 days
i went three weeks without a toner
for nearly forty dollars, i expected more.
it took about a week to start working
nearly three weeks after using this cleanser day
i've used it a few times
i've had a clarisinic brush for 2 years now
used for several weeks and no improvement.
this dried my skin out within the first two days of using it
specially not during drier months
used since last year
after completing the full month long treatment
that wrinkle disappeared over the course of the day
wanted to wait the entire month before reviewing
she suggested i wait a few months
i only used it for three days
it has taken me over two weeks for my skin to go back to normal
i've bought countless tubs of it over the years for myself
who has that much time in the morning?
after it was applied
i gave it 2 months
the first couple of times i used it i had amazing results
an giving the new formula a two week testing period
i've used this about 5 times now
have used it only 3 times
within 2 minutes it started to burn
the following days after the first time using everything
i been using this for three months possibly
i exchanged for luna after a little more than a week with this
other than that i don't see any improvements in my skin since i started using it a few months ago
have been using it consistently for the past 6 months
it worked great for the first two days
forehead a week after using it twice a day
i used it for about a week
used it for a month.
have to go over my face a few times
after using this for two days i started breaking out horribly all over my face
i used it about 10 times.
beautiful for several hours
within seconds after applying
it was amazing the first free days
after a few months of hyping myself up about it
the cooling honestly last for a couple seconds
i'd be lucky for this to last a month.
i tried it for a month
my pores were huge after using it for a couple of weeks
first time i used it i was oily within an hour.
a couple hours later my t-zone would become oily
used it all for about a month
i stopped using it a few weeks ago
after using this multiple times
just got around to it several days ago
used it a few times
i've used it on four separate occasions
three days later my face goes back to normal
i tried this three times to make it was the product
same cycle over and over again.
when it was time to reorder last time
s for the first time in years
which i had used for years
night for about 4 months
i only used it a couple of times
smooth for years using it
bought this last year
every time i use it for more than two days in a row
after 3 days of using it i have to stop
that since it's only been a short time
it lasted beyond half an hour on my face
i used it on only those areas for about 3months.
i used it for a couple nights in hopes of seeing past it
it lasted me only 1 month.
i tried this product for about a week
after using it for a couple of weeks
used them for over a decade
gave it a fair shot and used for a few weeks.
it worked well the first couple of days
1st one the battery lasted only 10-12 days
battery lasted only 1 week
i used this twice a day for around 6 months.
using it twice a day
after about a month i realized that i have not usual breakout
every few times i use this i end up with stinging
took one at 2 weeks
i used this product for about a month.
after over 3 weeks of use
way hoping to experience the total benefit of its claims within at least 2 weeks
however after 3 weeks now of repeated use day
after three weeks of using it, no change!
used this product every night for about 3 weeks
so since i had a lot left over
it was about four weeks
i used nightly for a few weeks
used them several times
i've used this faithfully for about three weeks now
when i used it the first time
but i only used five time, it's already empty.
i've broken out for the first time in a decade
if i stop using the product for a few days
used it a few days
the product did work after applying twice a day for 3 weeks
i used the deluxe sample for only three days on dark spots
i used this for over a month
i used it twice daily for nearly three weeks.
i used this serum twice a day for 4 days
had to reapply 5 minutes later because my skin was already super dry again
i've tried twice in past to review this
i put it on about 30 minuets ago
within minutes of putting it on
used it two nights in a row
it made me break out after a few hours
i used this half a dozen times to be sure
i returned if after 3 weeks
since it's the last product i use
lasted all day long
i gave it a couple weeks to try
used it for a few days
after a few days of using this i kept noticing more
before starting it 2 weeks ago i had red dry spots around my mouth since a really long time
it took a couple days before i could feel the hydratation
i used this for over a month with such high expectations
i used this twice a day
did find within the first few days that my skin was looking more hydrated
after a few days i started to react to this product
then after a few more applications i started to break out
i kept it for about 3 weeks
i will write a review about that one in a few weeks time
even with twice a day application
it will maybe last a month it's so small
then i broke out for the first time in years
more oily during summer months
had to for this one
a month in, i had to return.
changed to this for a few days
my nose is still dry after a few hours
not worth a third attempt especially since i haven't had a major breakout in years before this
i gave it about 3 weeks to see if it just took some time
especially in the winter months
this was the first product that did absolutely nothing to my skin even after wearing it nonstop for two months
after a couple days of use
have used it for years
marks are nearly gone
ive had it less than a month
this last time they changed the formula
used this for about 2 days
it got better after a few uses a few days a part
didn't last long at all.
i waited about 3 minutes
i will try this a couple more times before giving up
i've used this sample for three weeks now
at least once if not twice daily
i got this 3 days ago
i wish i realized this sooner before the 3month return period was uo
that was probably 20 years old at that time
i've used it now for a week
it goes away after about five minutes
have been willing to spend a little more than in previous decades
i used it for over a week
this is the first time a korres product hasn't delivered the results i expected
i've used it every day for the past four weeks
so technically 5-weeks total
every night for 5 weeks
that's twice a day for 5 weeks
i tried this product daily for about 3 weeks
night for the last 10 days
it lasted about three weeks
my skin looked exactly the same after the three weeks
returned it the next day!
i tried to work with this over the period of two months
i tried this 2 days in a row
stopped using it for a week
non-fuctional after about a week of use
ive been using this for about 2 months with occasionally switching it up to try other products
in fact at twice the strength
used the pep-start for 2 weeks
goes away after a few minutes
after month 2 the moisturizer started to separate
only problem is that after a few hours of applying it
been using it for 2 weeks now.
as i have posted in my review of the "power couple"
used it regularly for about 2 weeks
tried to use this product for 3 times in different weeks
the first day or two using this product was great
tried it for two weeks until it ran out
tried out the sample size for three weeks
about a month or so of constant use
i used it twice a day over the weekend
the bumps disappeared in a few days
i used this for 3 days
i did not have a single breakout for months before using this
s i have used in the past
have used it for 10 years
after a few hours my skin is dry
whereas before it would last all day
also with the new formula i am breaking out for the first time in years
i used it for a few weeks
it ended up breaking me out worse than i've been in at least a year
i still probably have another 2 months of using it left
been using this product for years
i started noticing a few blemishes after using it for just a few days
even after a month of use
i used this for about 2 months before i started realizing it wasn't actually working
not five minutes later
i felt like within 20 minutes
i used my sephora points to purchase this a few days ago
this only lasted about a month for me
i've used it for over a month now
ive been using this product as directed for about 8 weeks now
bought this and used it for a month.
i even tried using it twice a day
i tried it out for 30 days
i used it a few times
however after using it for 2 weeks my skin just keep breaking out
it has been 15 minutes
it's been five minutes since application
this broke me out within hours of using.
based on the few times i used it
i used this 3 days in a row.
i tried to use this mask a few times
especially during the summer months
off for a couple months
as the hours went by
it will last a long time
i've used this product for about a month.
it took me a few weeks to get use to the smell
i used it for 2 days
been using this eyelids cream for about 2 weeks now
less than five minutes later my eyes were irritated
really loved this the first couple of weeks i was using it
three hours later its flakey under my eye
i've used this every night for two weeks
within weeks i got more black heads than ever
a few hours into the day
just as i had expected
sorry to say i see no difference after three weeks of use
tried in for 2 weeks morning
also been using it for 8 weeks
i used this product for months
so far ive been using this for akmost a month
it hasn't even been a full week
the product is almost half gone
i tried it a few days with different foundations
this product started to dry my face after several days
took home samples on two separate occasions
after a few hours i noticed my tzone was very oily
i tried it several times
i even waited a few minutes before applying my foundation
after 2 days of use my skin has broken out.
i stopped using it for a few days
having tried it for a month now.
does dry down after a few minutes
i read about this a couple of months before sephora started carrying it
i didn't see any difference in my skin after two weeks
after around 2-3 weeks of continual use
another plus is that it will last a long time as i only use a small drop each day
i tried it out for a good 2 weeks every day different ways
oily to the point i have to blot about every thirty minutes
i really gave it a chance for a month or so
spent $42 on this product
for over fourty bucks
this is actually the first product that i've returned to sephora
so i had to have it just for those hot days.
two hours after application
well i used it for about a week
after about 3 days my skin went back to normal

my face was back to oily after a couple of hours
i tried it a few times
i used this for about 3 weeks
i used it every day for one month

after 2 days of using it morning
i tried this out for over a month
ful of products in the past several year
after using it for a few weeks
i tried it for a full 2 weeks
it went well for the first 4-6 days.
after the first week though, i was breaking out.
so first week of using this was amazing
during the winter months
off for a few weeks
after continuously using it for a week
used this product for a couple weeks
after about a week of daily use
it took two weeks to get my skin back to its regularly scheduled condition
unfortunately after trying it for a day or two
not even 4 hours of having it on
i've tried it two separate occasions
took some time testing it out before writing this review
it lingers on the skin hours later
after using it for about a week
after a few weeks of using this
tried out a sample of this for a few days
used it for a whole week
i tested it out for about a week
i tried it a few different ways for a few days
tried it for the first time today
which hasn't been available a while ago
after using this for a couple weeks my skin started to break out
was not an issue prior to using
i tried it for several days
after about two weeks of usage
this started to happen after the third time i used it
revisit it in a couple weeks to see if it's causing the breakout :
out for a long time
the sample really lasted a long time
breakouts went away a couple days after stopping this
night for about 4 days
i like the five in one concept
they used for a second time
have tried the cream for about a week
did i get oily within the first couple of hours
used it for 3 days
which i will say lasted quite about three months
off three weeks now
which only lasts for maybe an hour
after months of consistently using this morning
have used it 3 times
the third time i used less
after about an hour
i used it for a weeks
i gave it three days of trial before making this decision
it worked for like a week
i ran out like maybe a week ago
reduced from twice a week to once a week
my issues haven't completely cleared up since i stopped using it a month ago
at most two months?
even skipping a few days in between
might have lasted less?
it only lasted for 3-4 uses
have been using on an off for a month now
it has been difficult each time
especially since it's been recommended to me repeatedly
tried it a couple of times
the first time i tried this
two or even three pieces
after leaving it on for ten minutes
made me cough several times after intially applying
the next time i used it
at least for me
also the after about 2 weeks of use
i stuck with it for a month
i used this for about 3 days or so
i used this for 2 weeks
after about 3 weeks of using it
wanting something that was more moisturizing for the summer months
within 3 days of using this once a day
sent this one back after a week of use
i tried it out for a week
fresh for the summer months to come
it remained for a long time
after two month of use
after about a couple minutes

after a few minutes i notice it becomes sticky

this product kept me matte for a couple of hours.
the only bad thing about this product is that after two days of using this my face completely broke out
after over a month of use
only for about 3 hours

wasn't really expecting the eight hours the product promised
within less than an hour
i returned this after a week.

didn't notice a difference after multiple times of using it
left my skin super oily for a couple of days after using the product
had a huge breakout the next day
within hours my skin began to breakout
there are only so many hours in a day
the fact that i spent $45 on something that was gone in 3 weeks is not worth it
everything used it for 2 weeks

one bottle in less than a month
and i broke out a few times when using this.

the first time i used this product
did not notice any difference after using it nightly for over a month
one week of using this
i used it for almost a month
i've used it for almost two weeks now with no improvement
i'll use it up because i'm past my 30 days to return it
after using it for half the year
a little does go a long way as i have 2/3 of the jar left after using it for more than 6 months
which i wish i had realized years ago
after a week of using it
returned it the next day
returned after a few weeks.
the second time used a lot less
this should last me a year, five or take.
loved this product for the first few days.
within a week of use i began to see breakouts starting
've been using this for about 3 months now
after three weeks the actual product went bad
impossible to use during the day.
have been using it nightly for over a month now
waited until i had used it for a month before writing this review
i've given it about 15 minutes
i only used it for three nights
this product made me break out like i haven't experienced in decades
since i only used it for two nights it was not that bad
after a few days use
i used this as directed for about a month to try
its gone within 2 days
after only using this product for 2 days
tried this product for almost 3 weeks
ole henriksen for the last 2 years
i am breaking out for the first time in many years
after at least twenty minutes
i used more the next time
there were only two or three other ingredients
stings for a few minutes after i put it on
i used it about two weeks
an hour later though
i used it everyday for two weeks
i used this product for around a month
after the first week
three more weeks went by
after one week of use
i also started to break out after a week of using it
by after a few days i was breaking out all over
the first time i used a bit more oil than the second time
the second time i used less oil
i've use it for about a week now.
stopped using them waited a week
broke out within a few days
three weeks after using this twice
it is a little hard to smell for a long period of time
i've used this for 6 months.
i'll probably use it up since it's past the time frame i can return it
i will be returning this product along with 4-5 others i should have returned a few weeks ago
i will post more products with my review in a day or two
it will last you a long long time.
the first two days i used it went well
within two days of using this
have been using it for a few weeks now
later in the day
the results after 2 weeks were visible.
i got it as a sample which lasted me a couple of weeks
have had way better results in a short period of time
each time i tried this
after using this product for a few days
i tried this product for about 3 weeks before writing this review hoping to give it a good shot
he has been aplying this product almost daily
after using this product for one week
the day after i used it for the first time
look a million times better
ten days later i've gotten 3 pimples
granted 10 days isn't very long
i decided to wait to review this until i had been using the product for a few months because of the 95
my desire to review only after months of daily use
it's been two months
this product was too harsh for me when used daily for about 3 days
i've used this for a month
been using it for about 1 week now
it has been a month now
after six weeks of use i can't tell a difference
when used twice a day
this effect only lasts a few hours
if the lines were softened for a longer period of time
it didn't last long
used about one month
i started using this product about 5 months ago
for a few hours afterward
much better than the similar product in my play box a few months back
got a sample of this about 6 months ago
after having this products for months i decided to finally write a review
it made my skin oily after a couple hours.
i picked up a second bottle a few days ago
this is the first
i waited a minute or two
i decided to buy it last week since summer is around the corner
around 4 foundations the last few days which i thought were the problem
becomes oily within two hours
this bottle won't last me a month
probably will only last a couple weeks.
a few problems i have with it though are that the bottle leaked about a quarter of the product the first day i got it
i tried it a few times this past week
waited 3 days between tries
it literally lasted me less than a month
i tried it for 30 days
especially since i spent $150 on it
after taking it off after about 20 minutes
removed excess after 15 minutes
on 5 different occasions within two weeks
noticed it is clarins' new line launched about 6 months ago
i got a sample of it about a month ago
after giving it a good couple weeks
after 5 days of trying it out
even after 10+ hours
had been using for weeks a little goes a long way
couldn't apply foundation even after waiting 30 minutes
it's almost gone at 6 weeks
dry just like it had been before
however i noticed my skin starting to break out after a few days of use
i end up feeling dry again within a few minutes of using it
took about a week to recover
upon using it for a month to three months i had to stop using it
at least for me
i didn't even get a full 2 months worth
i used it on occasions only
it actually made it flake off in certain places after a few hours
each time it had the same result
i only used it for 3 days in a row
ended up shiny within 2-3 minutes of application
this is my second month using this product
i've had it a few months
at first used it once a week
i barely got half a dozen uses from this
since this has both i had high hopes
texture for about 4 weeks
it has been about 4 days since i have used it
within the first few uses
i usually break out when having my period
this time its been a week after my period
i used it for around two weeks now
i gave it a week
however, after trying it for a month now.
after 2 weeks or more of use, it is not.
i used it for several weeks
used it for three weeks with the argan milk which i do like
consistently until it was gone
it lasted for me, using once a day, 2 months.
after the first use
this stuff made my skin so beautiful after using it for a few weeks
within days of not using it my skin was back to normal
i used it for about 3 days
that i am literally still recovering three weeks later
i got this as a deluxe sample a few weeks ago.
in a few days i had several large breakouts on my face
on for over a month
in the past i have used ole hendrickson
loved it for the first week i used it
for the next few hours my eyes were in fire
i used for two weeks for a ten days for a fair review before returning
i used this face wash for about 2 months
the second time however
the last time i used it was over a week ago
this cleared up all of my acne within two days
i returned after just a few days
the winter months take their toll on my skin
in total i used this product for 5 weeks
tried this product as directed for 4 weeks
major breakout in my chin area after 2 days of use
i broke out for the first time in years
i tried it a few times
over ten years ago i used this product for over two years
i've had a small jar of this cream for over a year
that i have used in the past
it's been a week since i've stopped using this
my skin looked the same after a fews days use
i used it for one day
as an almost thirty year old
i got the sample size it was enough for almost two weeks of daily use which was nice
this product undid months worth of progress
have been trying it out for about a week
been using it for at-least 3 weeks now.
after using this for about a week
it broke out within two days of using this oil.
i've used this product for a whole month now
been using for six weeks
i wanted this product for months!
i used it for 4 weeks and nothing.
the flaking appeared again after about a week
after using it a few weeks it didn't do anything for my dark circles
unfortunately after a week of use
night for almost a month
after trying it for a few days my skin has become super dry
it've been using it for a couple weeks now
power eye cream for about 2 weeks now.
maybe it takes longer than 2 weeks

after using this cream for about three weeks i can honestly say i haven't seen a difference at all
i loved this product the first two weeks
i used it twice a day for a week before giving up on it
i've used this for a few weeks now
night for the last 3-4 weeks
i used it for a week with the other 2 products
had to try a few times for product to come out
however after a few days i'm having to give up
several new under-skin blemishes came up after using a few days
after using it daily for several weeks
have been using it for >2 weeks at this point
i think this would be great for the summer months
i tried it out for a couple weeks
the redness lasted too long to make the product worth using more than 2 weeks
for sure more than 6 hours
i tried it several times
i couldn't believe first of all that i had to use this within seven days for it to be effective
then for the price of it for seven days??
one $20 bottle is only for one week which means this costs almost $80 a month
other times just a few drops
with it only lasting 7 days
after the first time it now leaks out
i've used it for the last few months
used this cream for about a month
i used this for a few weeks

i kept using it for 2 weeks
after using this for 2-3 days with my makeup

so saw this on instagram a million times
i've only been using it for four days now
after a months use i gave up on it
i used it daily for the first maybe 2 months of having it
first couple of days i did notice it kept my makeup on longer
i ended up returning it after a few months using it
however after 3-4 days of using it
*this is the only new product i've used in the past five days or so
which i never had before
used it for 2 months
since using it for a month now

it did last all day
i tried several times with various foundations
after two weeks of use
this product made me break out after a few days of use

get a full sample that will last you two weeks
the new formula has also caused many breakouts in the two weeks that i have tried it

came back with a few hours
once or twice a week
will update in a few weeks.

the camera really adds ten or twenty pounds
used it for a couple of days
for a week now i've stopped using it
i found that it made my skin oily after just a couple of hours
been using it for years
after six weeks of daily use my final verdict is this product just doesn't work for me
after three days of use
i'd been using it for a week
it took a few days for the breakouts to come
i've had this for 3 months
i received a small sample of this a little over a month ago
i've used this for over a week
i tried this for a few days
after some continued use

after a week of using this

it is almost gone
i've only had it just about 2 weeks
within the first week of using it once every other day

after i've been trying for one week
after about an hour

you will turn red within 2-3 days of usage

night for about 2 months
i used this for about 3 months- no difference.
it was too heavy for daytime use even after waiting several minutes

after a few uses in the am
i used this product for a month
after several months of use
first 5 days were great
still used it for about a month
then about a week went by

a couple of hours after applying
i feel like mine lasts about 3-4 hours before i have to reapply
my jar lasted about one month
i tried this for a few days with the same results

after about 3 days my skin cleared up
this is good to use during more humid months

after using this eye cream for a few months
especially in the winter months
it only took about 2 months to get through the whole jar
it's been a little over a month
which i've had issues with in the past
within a minute of applying it
i attempted to use it again a few weeks later

they took sunscreen out of the product several years ago
during the winter though i have more combination- normal skin
i took a break from using this for a few weeks
i gave it another try two days ago
my foundation looked freshly applied after about 8 hours
my local sephora made up a sample for me that lasted about a week

i tried it for a couple weeks
within hours of using this for the second time to wash my face

i used this twice over the last week
couple of weeks later- dry
i tried using this for a few months now
i started using this two weeks ago
i used this for a couple of weeks
over the past year or so
this cream does last a long time

after a few weeks of using
after using this product consistently 1-2 times a day

after waiting for a while
after a couple of minutes the cream started 'curdling'
this is the second time i've tried to review this product
used the whole thing in about 2-3 months
tried using it for a few days
then i tried it again a week or so later
cakey--even after i wait at least ten minutes
even in the short term
after a few weeks of using it i didn't notice any difference
i received this as a sample in two separate orders that were spaced about two weeks apart
i still use 4-5 days a week
i've only used this 3-4 times

disappear within an hour of application
i actually returned it within a few days.
within a few minutes of applying my eyes were burning
every time i've used this
i switched back to another eye cream for a few days
have gone through several containers
did not see any results after 3 weeks.
it has been about 2 weeks.
i can only address the formulation of this moisturizer as i returned it after two weeks
takes a few minutes to absorb
i used this creme for about three weeks.
it wasn't until a few weeks later that red spots began appearing in the places where i had applied it
i started experimenting with murad products over the last year
i used this for 3 months.
i got a few samples of this a few weeks ago
this is my first time
after 4 days of using this
the bottle should last for months if you're only using one pump per use
after just two weeks
which i had been using
after using it for several days
i only used it for a few weeks
i've only been using this for a couple weeks as my day eye cream
which i have noticed in the last year or so -- i am 32

i used this cream for over a year
continued to use it for a couple days
i've en using this product for a few weeks now.
used them for a week
i returned all four items.
after 5 days of use my skin looked worse than ever
after 3 weeks of use i was hoping for better results
i returned it after 2 weeks of nothing.
for about six weeks now
have been using faithfully for four weeks
been using it for a month
i used on half of my body for three months to see if there would be a difference
diligently applied twice a day for 3 weeks
was rather unhappily surprised to find that the container only lasted for about 2 weeks
i've used it for 3 weeks applying it faithfully twice a day
i gave it 3 stars because i have only been using it for 2 wks
i will probably come back to review again in another 4 weeks
when i was told at sephora that it would last 3 months
i used it for about two weeks
i've used this for 6 months with very little change to the spot
i used this twice a day for two months
i tried waiting 15 minutes
i used it twice daily for 1 month.
after about two weeks
after six weeks i did not see any further change
then some hours later
even after one use....
disclaimer: i gave this three stars because immediately after using it
i used it a few times
i've since gone through countless jars of this
after a few weeks of use
i tried it for almost an entire month
that i had used for a long time
during the two months during which i've used it
i gave this product a full month
a week to test it out
headache within an hour's time
after 6 months i had to return both products
i gave this a try for a week on two seperate occasions

the glamglow thirsty mask 2 days ago
i started off with twice a week
i only used a few times
i applied this before bed for a few weeks
this is the first time this has happened in years
after using the turnaround only once
the first couple of days were great
things changed about a week in
used this for a few nights in a row
i tried for 3 weeks
caused my skin to break out after a few days of use
i stopped using it for a 2 week period
noticed that my skin cleared up within a few days
the first time i used it
after doing this for a few consecutive days
off during my adult years
i've only been using two weeks got to give it more time
ive used it for about a week
since i've been using this product
it has microglitter in it
the reason i'm giving this product three stars is because for the past week
i tried it for about two weeks.
after using it for the first time
i tried it a few times
in the two or three days i've been using this wash
i used it for about a month to really try
i stopped using it two days ago
after using it for a few days
within a few days i started breaking out really badly
only lasted me a little while
i tried it multiple times for multiple days
need to use this daily for at least a week to see results
do not use more than once every couple days
after four or five weeks it has shown somewhat improvement
i've used the product a couple of times
these marks lasted nearly 3 weeks.
3 times a day like the box said
it should last a long time
after using it for a few weeks i can't tell a difference
after using this product for a month
i applied it everyday for a week
the originis starting over is just too heavy on my skin type this time of year
could be great for very dry types or during winter months
i used this product for a month
at least for me.
since it sounded more intensive
i'll give it a few more weeks.
discovered this last fall/winter
after a couple of minutes of applying it on
i tried this version after once having the oil-free gel in the past
i gave it another try a few weeks later
about a week ago it occurred to me that this was the only product i added to my skin care
i stopped using this a few days ago
i only ever breakout right before my period
used it a few more times
about 3-4days after i quit it cleared up?
been using this for a few months
after a few days i had dry patches
i used it about 5-6 times
last year i had fallen hard for an eye cream made by origins
the first time i used it
after trying it for a few weeks
this alone for a couple of weeks
after nearly finishing the bottle in the course of 4 months of twice-weekly use
it took about 5 minutes
my skin has been near-flawless for weeks
i tried it several times
on for the past two years
i've used it a few times
i used this twice
used the whole thing a couple times a week over about 6 weeks
i left the mask on ranging on many times from 15 minutes to 45 minutes
i also used another mask a few days after this one
still use it twice a month.
have been using this product weekly for a few months now
i tried this for 6 weeks under one eye
i waited almost two monts before posting a review
i've used it for over a month
it was all good for a week
day for about 3 weeks now
after a few hours it looks as though i never even applied it
i used this for a month
i used it for over a month
i used this for one full month or more
then just a few hours after using it my skin felt even more oily than it usually is
after two weeks of using this cleanser once daily
after using it twice a day for two weeks
this was a while ago
for me at least
i've tried three origins products till now
used it a couple times
i returned it after five days of trying to make it work
i tried leaving it on for longer then ten minutes the second time
i used this a couple of times to not judge the product to quickly
i tried it for 4 days
i tried this mask several times
within a day or two
the first time i used it
good for the summer though.
the thought of using it a third day
just a couple hours after applying
after all the times i used
i've used it multiple times now with zero results
also after i had gotten 3-4 during my cycle
i returned it within 2 days.
especially in the summer
i used this product for 3 months
i tried it out for about a week
after a few days i noticed that my nose area would sting after application as well
had no idea when i need to buy more until i was all of a sudden out after barely having it for a month
the face wash that goes along with this product i have had for almost 3 months
good product, but lasted less than 3 weeks!
honestly it finished in two weeks
about 5 hours passed since the application
off for a few years
only got 30 days worth of product.
i also went through a whole tub in less than a month

i used this for nearly a year.
in just two weeks
i look at least 5 years older in the eye area now
i tried the product a three times
all three times i experienced the same problem
have been using the older version "repairwear intensive eye cream" for years
had an allergic reaction within days of using
returned it after using it twice.

after i used it
the bottle lasted longer than expected
i tried a sample of this a few hours ago after i got out of the shower
within a day of not using the boscia moisuturizer
with spring just starting in the northeast it just hasn't been hydrating enough for me
after using it for 3 days
this stuff made me break out within three days of using it
the only time i've ever had a few pimples was my first few weeks in this country when my skin was adjusting to the cold dry weather
this is a little odd because during the summer months i don't typically have any problems with dry skin
have given it more than a few weeks to get used to it
i used it daily for 2 weeks.
after the first day of putting it all over
so much that i started buying the bottle about a couples months every now
used it for 2 years now
i quit using this for a week
it has failed me twice now during travels
i broke out 2 days after i started using this
unfortunately it had been more than 90 days
takes several minutes to sink in
its been two weeks of consistent use
after 20 minutes or so
the first month of use was great
the months that followed were horrible though
its effects last a long time
bumps that lasted for 3-4 days
i returned it within 24 hours
not for 24 hours as the product claims
even after it had been absorbed
it is already half hempty

during this time i was struggling with ruddiness
using it for a few weeks
ive been using this every night for about 1-2 months

much more so that the previous bottles
especially if i apply it a few minutes after serum
i used it for two months and found no difference.
i've seen no results from this after using for 2 months straight
i actually returned the product after trying it for a couple of weeks
it's been a little under a year now since i have been using this product

i returned this product after a week of use.
i used this a few times
even after using it twice daily for days on end
i used it for a few weeks b/c i spent the money
i tried this for four days and had to stop.
after a few months of debating weather of not to buy it i finally caved
the entire bottle barely lasts 6 weeks if you follow the application instructions
i tried a sample of this over about five days
i've tried it for a couple of days now
in the morning too for about two weeks
i will continue to use this for the next week
the price is very hard to take in addition to the fact that this barley lasted me a month
after testing this out for two weeks
even in the summer months
third use in two months
at least over time
after a couple weeks of using it i developed a mild burning reaction
been using for a month and no change.
i gave this a good two weeks of use
took me over a year of leaving it
used this for a month
after using this consistently for months on end i noticed not one improvement
i used this product for two weeks
after having used this twice a day for more than a month now
by the second day using this product
i used this product for a total of five days
after starting with three times a week
after about three weeks of once a day use i started to notice good results with increased firmness
when i stopped using it for a short period
for the first 2-3 days
the next few days were a mess!
after about four days of using this product my skin became extremely oily which then caused breakouts
this has only happened one other time
of the times that i used it
tried it a few more times
had to return it after a few uses
few days later they have developed into pimples
used it a few times at night
i continued usage because i thought it was just 'that time of the month
judging by my skin for the first few days
this product had to be returned
thought it was working for the first 2-3 days i was using it
after about 2 weeks of using this regularly
i am taking a few days off
i used this product consistently for a good two months
i used it for about a week
it was effective for the first month
onto the fourth month now since then
had lots of break out after using for two days.
have been using this for 3
i've used this product for over a year
this effect increased as in the next month or so that i used the product
returned it after 2 days.
tried for a few days
during the summer time
after using it for three days
during the winter months
to test if it was hormonal i stopped using several times
bottle lasted about 2 months.
ive been using this for a week.
i used this product for 7 days
used it for about a week
i used this s few times.
used it for two weeks before realizing that my never-before-seen craterous acne was the result of this product
bought this 3 months ago
after using this serum for a few weeks
i used it for about a week or two
had a breakout within a week
used it for about a week
will use it a few more times
after trying it on three separate occasions i've discovered it's just not for me
since i started to use this product i saw my skin older than before
i used it religiously for the first 2 weeks
tried it for a few days
after 4 days of use with new break outs every 12 hours
after 4 days of using this newly-gotten moisturizer
like the worst i've had in over a year
used it three nights in a row
it has been a few days
followed the instructions to use 3 days in a row
let it sit for atleast half an hour for about a month then i ran out of the product
i ended up using more than half the container within the 2 weeks i tried it
maybe it's because i'm turning 36 next month
it's been about 3 weeks
i needed three to four for my face
i used the product twice only
after using it for one month day
you will run out of the product in about 3 weeks
one more week only using it once a day since it was running out
only had it for 2
half the product was already gone
been using this product for about a week now
so far its been a week.
t lasts a long time
i've used it for about three weeks now
got this about a month ago
even after washing my face several times
it off about an hour ago
i used it for about a week
used it a few times
i used twice a day usually before and after work.
i used this product twice a day
you have to finish it up within 6 months
however, after 2 weeks of using during daytime.
i used it for about 2 weeks
after using it for a good 1-2 months
i still have to blot my face several times a day with this
by the way i've been using this for two weeks now
i used it for 2 days
i've used this for about a year.
within an hour of using this
after using it for three months
tried one more time
however, since the first use.
i used this product everyday for almost three months
tried it for a few nights
i hoped for an improvement within a few days at the most
ever since philosophy discontinued their replenishing night oil which i used for years
i used it 2 months every night, with no results.
i used it religiously for 4 months
i will update in a couple of months.
i feel i have aged 5 years in one month!
after using all products for 1 month
after the first couple days i thought it was making my skin more radiant
it lasted for a few weeks
after using it for a week
but after 5 days of use, i started to break out.
i used this for six weeks
i tried it for a month
the first 3 weeks i loved it
i been using this estée lauder product for about 6 years now
i've had this for almost 9 months
i used it for over 2 months
on to the next product!
almost too heavy for summer.
so the first couple weeks i used this
i stopped using this for next 3 months
later i re-started to use this
i am still using this currently its almost finished
i can say that after using it for several months
have used it for years
i used it for nearly a month
night for about a month

it has lasted quite a while though

wish i hadn't spent the money--about a month later i started to see some dryness under one eye
i feel i have aged 5 years in one month!
after using all products for 1 month
used regularly for over a month
which lasted me for a little over a month
may try again one or two years later.
i used it for about 3 weeks
i actually could only use this for a few days before i ended up returning it
after only a couple days of use the skin under my eyes looked
it's now been a month that i have been using this eye creme
i feel i have aged 5 years in one month!
after using all products for 1 month
l used for a month
after about 5 days or so
after only 1 month of purchasing even though the bottle says 12m
with continued use for a week
i've had my bottle for about 10 months now.
about a month ago i decided to give this another try
this has happened 2 times now
i tried multiple times
it's lasted me about 4 months
2 times per week usually
returned it after a week.
i used this for the first time
i've used this product for several years
after the packaging/formula update about a year ago
after using it twice i returned it due to that smell
bought this a few months back
it has been 2 hours since i've applied it
its been over a month
i still tried to use it a few more times
i waited past the 2 week period of adjustment.
i used this product for 2 years
when i first used this
good for winter months.
that lasted me at least a week
it usually disappears within 2 hours
has worked very well for me in the past
is at days dry
i used this product last when i was 10 years old.
i used it every day for about 2 weeks.
on to the next one.
have using this cream for about 2 years.
have been using it everyday for the past 5 months
i will stop using this for a few weeks
i did see results the first week to about 3 months
after two months i started getting pimples again
one after another at a time
well after 3 month of use all bottles were about 25% gone
it has not been 6 months
the skin will feel dry after few hours.

after about a week of use
was hopping to see results after a few weeks.
i know it days see a different in 10 days
noticed a glow after using this for a short period of time
again it's been one day
i used these for 3 weeks
i used this product for about 12 days
even after 10 days as indicated on the label
i stopped using after 12 days
i do like this… when i have a breakout i use this for a couple days
i've only been using this a couple days
my skin is only now getting back to normal almost 6 months later after religious use of retin-a
i kept using it for two weeks
i am only about a 15 days into the product
stopped working after about a month
have had this product for over a year
purchased this product last year
haven't had a breakout in many months
after a month of using this cleanser i had to return it
i used it for about a month
i received this product a couple months ago
evening for about the last 6 weeks
i felt like a had a lot more breakouts the last couple weeks
since i have used oil cleansets in the past without any issues
for those two reasons
stopped using after a few days.
i continued to use this for about 2 weeks
i used this day cream for about 3 weeks
i started getting one every week
as after three days my skin was red
it's been over a week
for the first few days
it has been about 6 weeks now.
worked in the first few weeks
skin under eye has now started drying out after about a month of use -- twice daily
later in the day
after 2 weeks of really giving it a chance
i only used it once during the day
i allowed it to dry for about 20 minutes before applying anything over it
this product made me look 5 years old as the day progressed
an hour to several hours
used this product for months
i used this product for four weeks
i used this product regularly for 3 months
i even took pictures every couple days to track the progress
it's certainly not work almost a hundred dollars.
i used this product twice a day
i used this consistently for a month
have been using it at night time since i did spend $100 on this
i am 24 years old, normal skin, never break out.
i waited a few weeks
i've used this product now for 2 months
have used it for a week or so
i started using this product daily about six months ago after asking a trusted sephora associate what she recommended for evening skin tone
in the first two weeks
it was great for two weeks
after using this product for a week
after using it for about 6 wks
the bottle lasts for three or four months
it took two weeks of using it to figure out which product was causing the breakout
been using it every day
within days of starting to use it
i used this twice a day for 60 days
one container lasted two months
about 15-30 minutes after i used it
the last time this happened with a product
i tried three different moisturizers: one lancome
i used it religiously for a week
night for four weeks
others are noticing a change in a few days to a few weeks?
been using this now for 3 weeks
a few hours after i put it on
they sent it every month.
i stopped using after 1 week
been using this for almost a month
after using it for a week
so the next day
it has been a week
used if for a few days
that i've done many times before
unless is that time of the month
i returned it after using it for 2 weeks.
this is the only product i have tried in the last five years that has broken me out
i gave it another try months later
i've used it about 3-4 times already
absorbs completely after about ten minutes
that was the day i only used one drop!
i experiment several days with this oil under my foundation
after using this product for several weeks
i used it for 5 days
each time within the day
i tried this for a week
the first time i used it
for almost $50 i was expecting more
it lasted me about 3 months
has led to some breakouts in the past couple of weeks
made it to day three
after trying this for a few months i just don't think this is the product for me
i tried it for three weeks
i've had this for several months
it took over a week for it to go away
it's def a must have especially during the winter seasons
i just couldn't get past the first two days
i ran out in a little over a month
a problem i hadn't for 25 years
i used the product for only two days
two weeks later things are just settling down
i tried it for a few days
it has been over 2 weeks since i stopped using the cream
when i went to return it two days later
i just started using this stuff a couple of weeks ago
after using this for about 2 months
after a couple days of use
i tried it for a few days
about an hour after applying this
i just sent this back after using it for a week
i tried it for a week
it has been a week of continuous evening use
after using the 30 day trial of shiseido's ibuki line
i used this product for about 4 weeks
tried it out for about a month or so
have been using it for a week
i used this product regularly for 6 weeks.
a half month using it every day
after a month an half
after using the product for three days i started seeing breakouts

ive been using it for about a week an a half
i used it for a month
i used it for about a week
used it for months now
stopped using this for a day or 2
have to re-apply in a couple of hours.
i started using drug store moisturizer about a year ago
its only been a little over two week since i started to use it
i also didn't see any results after two weeks
i can't even finish the basic 5-minute nuface regimen without having to reapply this gel several times
it should last as long as the 5-minute regimen
which can last throughout the 20-minute advanced regimen without the need to reapply
i've only been using this for under 2 weeks so maybe i'm not giving it enough time
it took about two weeks for my skin to clear up
i used it for 3 months- looks like i did not use any cream for 3 months at all
after using it for a few weeks
for at least one minute
used it for the rest of the week
it was winter time
i've used it three or four times
after about a weeks usage, i threw it away.
i used this mask for about two weeks
which lasted about 2 1/2 weeks
i feel i have aged 5 years in one month!
after using all products for 1 month
it's been about 2 months of using this twice a day
i tried using it for approximately two months
after less than a month of using it
been using it for about a month
i used it for about a week
was told to use for several weeks to see a difference n saw nothing then returned it
i used it for two weeks
i started using this product a few weeks ago.
tried for a week, saw nothing.
used it for about a week
have been using this product since january
night for about six weeks
should last a long time
i searched for months for a good replacement
after a few days using it i noticed my skin was very dry
i used it regularly for 6 weeks.
after about a month of using it my skin in this area was peeling off
i applied it for several days just to be sure
the first few days of trying
it worked well the first two weeks i applied it
especially in the cold winter months
only used it twice
after going through half of the pot over a month long period i did not see any results
has never failed me in the past
i used this cream for a few weeks.
especially with summer coming
for about two hours
with 3 weeks of use now
it's been several months
i've only been using about three weeks
its only 2 weeks i have been using it
have been using for 1 month
after this trial period
i used this product 3 times before giving up on it
maybe if it were fifteen to twenty dollars instead
have tried it twice
have been disappointed twice
then after waiting a day or two
i attempted the mask two additional times over a three week span
have used for 2 months and notice nothing.
after week six i was disinterested in the product
i did a few things, waited the 20 minutes.
off for a few weeks before finally giving up
i used it about 5 times
the first few times i used it
despite using it once or twice per week for the last few months
i've used this a couple of times now
i used this product daily for about six months
took weeks to repair the damage
after using it for about a month
after using for two days
i've ordered it three different times though
used this for a while
i kept using it two or three times a week
i tried this a few times
used it a few times before returning.
i just began using it after having it on a shelf for just under two months
i saw no difference at all after using it for about 5 weeks
it has been a brutal winter
got it close to year ago
have been a fan of dermadoctor products in the past
i used it for about 2 weeks
wanted to wait a few weeks before giving my results
i've tried it for a month so far
a few weeks later i tried it on my husb
been using for a month religiously and no change.
each sample packet lasted about a week with nightly use only
i've got a deluxe sample that i have been using for the last couple of weeks
after using this product for three weeks
on to the next one...
reached for another sample of this a couple of days later
it lasted me almost a month
i tried the eye cram since a couple of sale people in the stores had recommended it
after a couple of days it burn my eyes
i've tried it over two weeks
she was about 30 years old
especially in the summer
it lasted maybe a week
it lasts for all day
there's a huge problem however- all the benefits my skin has been receiving from other products the last few years diminished after a few weeks of using this
after i stopped using it for a couple of weeks it is starting to go back to normal
waited 30 minutes before deciding that enough was enough
it was nice for a month
i waited almost 45 minutes
even after having it on for a long period of time
after two mins i had to rise off since it was too overwhelming
i used it for a few weeks
i expected a lot more when i spent $25 on a small container
on to the next one
my skin is soft for three days by just using it one time
i tried it a few more times
i've done well with glamglow in the past
two stars instead of three for the price.
after spending $158 for this
have used them for several years
when i use this cream it balls up after a couple minutes
night since receiving a large sample bottle from sephora almost a month ago
the worst he has seen my skin in the past 3 years
in just the past 2 days
i tried using this multiple times
much too heavy for spring or summer
it did after using this product for a few days
its been over s months
this is the only eye spf i use for years
gave it a chance for a month
flakey within several minutes
i used it a couple times to take off my make up after a long day
wow, i've tried several times.
my sight is blurry for at least five minutes after i've used this product
it only lasts about an hour
i used it for a few days and sadly returned it.
which has never happened before
i will use the remaining product from time to time
i just tried this for the first time yesterday
i tried this for over a month
i used it for 3-4 days and returned it.
downfall was, the benefits lasted about an hour!
have makeup-less days recently
have had it less than a month
the jar cream lasted me almost four months with twice a day use
another thing was that after a few days of using it
some huge bumps were showing after three days using it
i've had this mask for about 6 months
i used it twice
after only a few hours of wear
this cream gave me three pimples after three days of use
i stopped using it after about a week.
and i gave it a good try of at least 3 months.
burned for over a half hour
i felt like it made my dark circles worse after a few weeks of use
i tried it a few times
it looked awesome for about four hours.
feel super dry after a few hours
it went back after two weeks.
i tried it for 2 weeks, then returned it.
i just started using it not long ago
once a week is great
twice a week is better
fast forward to two weeks
now that i've had it for a little shy over a month
i've reached for it about three times.
i tried this product for a full two weeks
the first couple of times
which is to use a normal amount for 10 minutes
i've had it for 9-10 months
this came up multiple times
i used this product last week
if the break out does not get under control in the next few days
i brought it back because i used it several times
just used this cream 10 minutes ago.
i've owned this product for a few weeks now.
when in fact i have used it 20 + times
i just used this mask ten mins ago
for maybe two days if anything
i first used it for 10 minutes
after a few days of not using it anymore
leaving on for 10+ minutes each time
i used it for two days
peeled after a few days
the first month, i was pleased.
second month in i started to develop rough
it's been about a week of using the wash
trying it for a week
get a second sample if you run out before a week is over
ive been using this product for about 3 months now
its been two days i stopped using it
the first times i used it
within another use or two
i started off only using this once a day
after not using this for a week
wish i had figured this out before the 60 day return period
heavy moisturizers for weeks after only using this twice
since i've been using it my face has been in its worst condition
a couple days ago i discovered really dry
i will have to say that i have used the same cleaning product for my face for the past ten years
did give this product a little over a week
you use it a while even months
this broke me out in just a few hours of using it
it is perfect for spring and summer.
could have returned this to the store
i loved it for the first two weeks
now that i'm using it every day
after wearing it for a couple of weeks
it's been a couple months
i got this for like a month
washed it off after less than 5 minutes
which i wanted for summer
well, it has been a few weeks now.
i used it for few more days just to confirm that it was the cream that was causing it
i used it for almost a week until i started to get a reaction from it
i started using this in the winter.
at least in the beginning
after the first couple times of using this
i just finished my first jar after a few months of use
during the spring time
after 2 months of regular application
after four solid months of twice-daily application
used it twice a day
the spots were not removed after several months of using this treatment
this was about a month
night for almost three months
cleansed for the next 2-3 days or so
four-stars for that.
cleared out one pore over the 4-5 times i've used it
tried it out in the span of a week
i could tell a difference from using this after three days
it took a couple weeks to get my skin back to normal
my skin stayed dry for a couple days
i've used this product a couple of times
the first few minutes are really intense- almost too intense
i tried it several times
it just was a total waste of time
even several days later
it went away after a couple of minutes
i ended up breaking out a few hours after
i've tried this product three different times now
have had the same result each time
i really felt the product was starting to work after about a month
also that one side stopped dispensing over three weeks before the other side
after a couple of days of using this serum
my break outs cleared up a few days later
a month later i decided to test it out again
i decided to give it one more chance yet another month later
a couple years ago i tried ptr's camu camu moisturizer
i'll give it a couple more days.
note: this is after 20 minutes of applying the product
i've had it for a few weeks
seen no results after 2 months.
have bought it a couple times
i used five nights in a row and saw no change.
i've used it every night for two months
i used this product for almost a month
i used this eye gel for two weeks
it really lasts for a few times of use.
i invested in a jar a few months ago
however it has been almost 3 weeks
after several minutes it drys up
when i first started using this about 2 months ago
i used this for about a year
i used it two days before my engagement party
i used it for about 2 weeks
my skin peeled a couple hours after application
after using it once daily for three consecutive days it began to break my skin out from dryness
i tried it twice a day for a month
i used this faithfully every day until the tube was used up so about 2 months
night for two months
she has been using it for couple months now
i tried this cream for a few weeks.
the problem came about 5 minutes later
i spent the next hour with horribly running
i've since stopped using the product
night for a month now
-breakouts for first two weeks
or fine lines on my face after 2 months of daily use
i used it for 3 months straight
maybe 2 months max using as indicated
however this product lasted me 2 weeks
i used this consistently twice a day for a month in conjunction with the nightnight cream
i've used this for a couple days.
i used this product for 6 months
i only used it once every couple of days
now, after about 10 days, i'm not as excited.
i used for good 6 months every night
i tried it a few more times
the bottle lasted me 2.5 months.
i used it twice a day
it also lasted me a long time.
it had been a while
i didn't see any results after using it consistently for a few months
used it for 30 days (approx.)
no change using this after about 6 weeks
it took years off by smoothing
i used shiseido benefiance prior to this
i've continued to try using this one for almost 3 months just to use it up
i tried for two weeks and saw no difference.
try it for a month
after two weeks only i had had enough.
have only been using it for a couple weeks
will post another review in another two weeks if i note a marked improvement
it goes bad within three months
three out of four hardened in the tube before i could use them
i used it few times
i used this until the package is nearly finished.
as evidenced by the two earlier reviews
the first time i used it
i've used it every three days for two weeks
however after i tried it for a week
i've used this cream for about a month
up until last week when i began to break out all over my face
havent finished it in several months
just started using this product for two days
especially in summer time
tired it for 2 weeks
i used this product for about three weeks
within two days my skin was dry
used it religiously for 10 months
there was no improvement in my skin after using if for three months too
have more than half bottle left
however in 2 weeks i got little breakouts all over my skin
even after trying each variation for at least 2-3 weeks at a time
i tried 3 days in a row
used it a few times
used it for a week
it fixes everything within days
it lasted almost 5months which was great!
saw results after a month pf using it
only 3 times the cost
took it back after a few days of using it.
off for about 5 months now
this was great in the winter months
i've only used this about 3 times now
i used this two days in a row
haven't since i discontinued using it immediately
i've had this cleanser for about 2 months now
i used it for a couple of days
this is the first time in all the years i have shopped at sephora that i am returning a product
so far after using this product for over 2 months i am extremely dissatisfied
within the first 2 weeks of use
sadly after applying it every night for over a month
i used this for a few months
twice a day for 3 weeks.
i used this for a month
i tried this for a week
the first few times
dropped it the first time using it
i've used this several times
i used this product for 2 weeks
not some other factor as i have had no new breakouts since i stopped using this product 5 days ago
a little too much for my skin in the summer months
first time i have ever returned anything from sephora in my life
i've tried this for a few nights now.
i used this product as i was supposed to for about a month
i used this product for about a week
few months is all it lasts
tried it for 3months!!
been in it only for two weeks.
well i've been using this for almost 2 weeks now
this is a three times a week kinda mask
used it for almost a month with no results
decided to try this product that it was recommended long time ago by a friend
for the first few days, it did work for me.
after using it for about a month now day
it's been a couple of weeks
i used it for two days
i used this cream for the past 2 months
after just one use
the pump broke a few weeks in
it doesn't last longer since i don't even have a a full month it
had to return it the next day
have used it a few times
after less than a week
i used this everyday for a month twice a day
i've used this product for three weeks
i've had this for a couple weeks
i waited about 45 minutes
i used this for a whole week
after a bit more than a month
i religiously used up the entire bottle in a month or so
after 3 months of daily use
using it for over a month now
used it for 3-4 weeks consistently
the bottle was less than half full
it lasted me under two weeks
i started by applying three drops twice a day
used this product for two months
i finished the bottle in three weeks
finished the whole thing in about 3 weeks
after that amount of time
used it for a week straight
any effect of course only lasted a few couple of hours
the results don't last
tried a couple more times, with the same results.
within 2 days of using however
after a few applications of this
i wrote a review a few months ago
i used it for about 3 weeks
3 days after i had stopped using this
jart products i've used in the past
ive used it for the past year.
i used it regularly for about two weeks
i've had this cream for three months now.
initially i used it 3 days straight
bought this jar about 6 months ago.
use once~twice a week.
this has never happened before
i tried a few more nights
i tried it every night for two months
at least until this jar is gone
i've used this ever night for a month
and 16 days from my wedding none the less!
all of this after only using it one time
maybe i need to use it more than 2 nights in a row
after using this one time i broke out at least 3 acnes
i waited few weeks later then use this again
ok for once or twice a week
i've started to use it only 2-3 times a week
i used it twice.
using a few times a week for three weeks it started breaking me out terribly
as soon as i stopped using it my skin returned to normal within a few days
tried a sample a few days ago
i used this twice daily for a month
i've used this for 6 weeks
i used it religiously for almost 2 months hoping that with time
been using this product for few weeks
eighty nine dollars is a lot of money for something that doesn't work
after another several uses
it did absolutely nothing for my crows feet after using it twice a day for 2 weeks
night for over 1 month
at least in the short term
used it for about 2 weeks
about 3 weeks now i think
i used it for 2 weeks
i tried it for about 2 weeks
i've only been using for a couple weeks
i used it only on one side of my face every night for two weeks
tried it before for almost a month.
or live with the fine lines that just started appearing over the past year
it is now the last week of december
i used this product for about a week
that only lasted for about ten minutes
however i have used two bottles
i used it twice a day
it only last 4 weeks
t some time ago
i've used it for 2 weeks straight
4 months later i thought i would try it again
it's been like that since day one.
it lasted me about 2 weeks of daily use.
using 2 xs a day for last 3 weeks
saw no difference after using for 2 weeks
i returned this product after using for 5 weeks
after the two months
especially in the first half hour
i used as directed for two months.
2 to 3 days later my skin started feeling bumpy
it has gotten oily just a few hours after using it
all my issues cleared up within 2 weeks
it purged my skin for the first week which i read was normal
then cleared up for a few days
i still have that acne and it's been two weeks.
a week after using this
despite having this product for over a year
using it everyday in my routine for six months
since i have a couple of cleansers i end up using this just once or twice a week
it lasted about 4 months with daily use i must add
i tried this a couple of times
used it the first time
after 2 weeks i still have a few of the blemishes
i've had this cleanser for about 2 weeks now
i got this oil in earlier this week
tried it for the first time
after a few consecutive days my skin looked dull
i tried it a few years ago
the first two weeks were amazing
used for several nights.
for the price i was expecting this to last all day
after couple times it got little better
i used this product for 1 week
its lasted me about 2 weeks for the small jar
been using it for a few months now
after using philosophy's hope in a jar for more than 4 years daily
used this product twice a day for a 2-3 months
have been using this cream for at least a couple of months
after three weeks of trial
a half of twice-daily use
i used it twice a day for about 3 weeks
took photos every few days in similar lighting to compare
after using it for 4 weeks i can say this
i used it twice
i used this for about two weeks
i waited about 10 minutes
however, after 2 weeks, i notice something odd.
was able to use it a few times
it broke my skin out after two days of use.
i spent a year doing the double cleaning method
a couple of months into the product use
have been using it a few weeks
i used this for about 3 weeks
after about 2 months of using this product every night religiously
i used both every other night for two months
i've used this for almost a year now
i used this for 3 weeks
the first 2 weeks were fine
i used it every night for a few months
ive been using it for 3 straight months
i started using this product 6 months ago
i've used it for almost 2 months and nothing.
using it twice a day
this bar dried out my face completely within the first three days of using it
have been using it now for over a week as part of my pm routine
the first couple of times using this was fine.
as instructed for over a month
peekee in the morning maybe once every couple weeks
still have half of a bar left after 6 months of using
after one week of use
i've only been using it for a week
after about a week of use
added this into my routine for three days
three days later i had to return it
after using it for a month i see no improvement in my skin at all
lines on my forehead that weren't there two months ago
this happened a few days ago
two hours after application
did it's work first couple of days
after using this oil
after using this twice
used it for a few days
i used it for a couple of days in which my skin looked like it aged 10 years
who has time to cleanse in three steps
one week after i started to use this product i got a lot of bumps
i started using it around 30 days after purchasing
tried it several times
a half weeks with no improvement at all
i've used this for over a month
this is the first product from sephora i've ever had to return
i used it for a full seven days
after using it for 4 weeks
wore this alone two different times
i tried it a few times.
the past five years it really has gone down hill on quality
the only positive i can share is that the product absorbs well after a few minutes
i tried it this product two nights in a row.
now that i've been using it for a couple of weeks
picked this up a month or two ago because my pores were out of control
after the two days before that ran out
as i used it more it started to be too drying since the seasons changed from summer to fall
after using this for a few days
after about seven days of continued use
i waited a few weeks to write my review
i used it 5 times already for the past three weeks
i acutally stopped using it for a couple weeks
i just tried couple of times from the set
i've used this mask now 4 times.
i used the entire jar over a period of time
i've used it a few times
here we are five days later
i used this earlier today
i’ve used this more than a few times
use it at least once or twice a week.
i've tried it about 4 times
i used this for a week
left it on for ten minutes
i couldn't last for more than 2 minutes
after just one use
less than five minutes later i had to take it off because my skin felt like it was on fire
after a few days, my face still has small bumps.
after i use this
tried it a few times
bright red for the next few hours
it worked amazing the first month or so when i tried it

i took a break for three days

the first few days of using it was good
bottle lasted me about 3 months.
i've only been using it about 3 weeks
been using it for three days
after the third use
i got for a month now
a few weeks ago i finally decided to phase it out of my skin care routine
while it worked well for the first few applications
after a similar situation after a 4 week period of using the product daily i've returned it
i tried it for a little over a month
i've used it for about 3 weeks.
i've use it roughly 4x a week since i received it

dark circles over a 2 week period of twice daily applications

it's been about 3 weeks since i've been using.
i used this for several months before finally giving up
does nothing for dark circles after 2 months of daily use

the first time i used this
over time with continued use

after a few days, i didn't see any difference.
i just used it twice
the first couple days i tried this
have been using them for the past 15 years
a couple days i've used this when my skin was clear
every since i started using this product
several hours after i first tried this product
waited a few days later to try it again
after using it for months
what i thought would go for at least 6-8 months
i threw out the sample after a few days
this product was being thrown around on the internet as a miracle product a year or 2 ago
i used this almost consistently for over 6 months
after a year i had been on again off again with this serum
i tried only for a few weeks.
using it 2-3 times a week for almost a month

i did notice that after using it for about a month i have more whiteheads than i've ever had
this product seemed to work very well the first two weeks i used it
after that period my skin began to break out

which did take about 7 months or more

maybe three or four pumps
this happened with four different packages.
while it does help to mattify the skin for a few hours
well after using it for a while
after 3 days of using it, i had to return it.
it just doesn't last all day
three hours into my work day
same result every time

the best that happens is a few hours
since i already had makeup on while in the store

i began to have oily skin within the past year or so
i've had the tube for less than a year
probably has only been opened for 6 months

i only used this for three days twice a day

after a few days of using this product i noticed my skin became very dry
after two weeks my face continued to get worst.

i've had this for over 6 months now

after only wearing for a few hours
i used this stuff a few times
i tried it out for a month

hour after i applied it
tends to separate after about an hour
within a few days after use
less than a minute for me
with it being on less than the recommended 5 minutes

wish i returned it earlier.
my skin was burning after only a few minutes

i used it for a week
i used it once a week
it has been about 2 weeks that i have been using it
i used it close to every day for a few weeks

've been using this once to twice a day for the last two months
all other life would be extinguished by the end of the ensuing seven years
i've only been using it for a week
i tried this product for about 3 days
i started to break out a few hours later
now that i haven't used it for a few days
having using this product for a year
used last three days
especially since the product itself advertises "use three days in a row for improved results
after two to three uses of this product
i used this almost every other day when i first bought it
i did the first three treatments three days in a row as recommended
apparently wearing sunscreen daily since i was twenty hasn't helped there
just finished the jar last week
my results did not last for 24 hours
i started using it a little over a month ago
however just when i started to notice a change 4 weeks in
the bottle lasted me a little more than a month
the next week or
i used it consistently for two months
this product did nothing for me after 2 weeks i'm definitely returning
within two days of trying this
after using for 4 nights in a row
i tried it two nights in a row
the first time i used it
unfortunately it continued to break me out after weeks of using it
was able to use it for about a week
i tried drying his product for as long as thirty minutes
used it for three days- every morning after i used this
even after using every so often for a couple months
would've given it four stars
besides it doing nothing for under my eyes it also only lasted two weeks
i used one twice a day
it only lasted the two weeks
after 1 month of continuous use
used it for a month day
used it faithfully for 8 weeks
i used it again a few months after
used it again for 8 weeks and saw no difference.
5 weeks in it just stopped
after 2 month i have already started my second treatment
laser for two weeks
so seven weeks total between the two lasers
i used this for 12 weeks every day
it took weeks to heal
the first month that i used this
then it died after a few weeks
was using it for a few days when i realized that my face had started breaking out
i used these for 25 days.
she suggested i used it twice a day for at least weeks to see results
i used it a couple days
i returned it by week two of use.
after two weeks i noticed dark spots
only owned for a day so far
after 5 days it was still stinging once applied
after having it on for a few seconds
after using it for just 2 weeks
after a whole 2 months of continuous use
after a couple uses it started to sting
i would have to wait more than 20 minutes for my face to dry
the next day i had breakouts
thankfully, it went away after a couple of days.
however does soften my face after a few hours
which has disappeared from sephora for some reason
i wish i had returned it weeks ago
after about two weeks of using this my under eyes are completely dried out
i applied this straight for about a month now
i used a couple samples of this for several days in a row
i've used it now daily for 3 weeks with no notable results
tossed it within two days because of the fragrance
had this product for a month
it got dry all over again after just a couple minutes
for over two weeks
however i've been using it for a couple of weeks now
i gave it a try for 2 months
that lasted only an hour
i been using it for 3 weeks now.
i tried it for 2 weeks until i had an allergic reaction to the product
i've used it for 3 months
my face has been flawless for the past two months despite suffering from hormonal acne in the past
this is the first of three products in the immortelle line that i've tried
however, after two days of use my skn is on fire!
have been using this cream for about two months now every morning
after three weeks of use
since it was over 90 days, i was not eligible.
decided on this one since it's new
after only a few minutes on my skin
dryness in a few places which didn't stop until i limited use to a just a couple times a week
haven't used it for a week or so
have been using it for over a month now
been using for a few weeks.
i ended up getting red spots after using it for a few days
it's only been a couple of weeks
i used this twice a day
this one has it
for over one hundred dollars that is just not acceptable
already broken after just two weeks use.
stopped using on my face after a few days.
bought this a while ago
after i started using this product
i returned it after using it for a month because its way too much for just another eye cream
i used this for over a month
've been using this for a long while
i've had the product for less than a month i'm a fifth of the way through the bottle already
night for over a month
even from over 2 weeks of use
i've used it for about 2 months now
used for close to two months
after about a week of using this entire 3 step system
i used this product consistently for 2 1/2 months
the first two bottles have lasted me 3 months each
the disappointment came when i ran out of the product after less than a month
that's with using once a day instead of twice like previous two batches
used for over a month usually twice a day
the first time i ordered this
used it for a week during the dry
used it for 3 weeks
i could apply it 3-4 times a day
tried for the first time last night
i, too used it 3 days in a row.
have used it at least three times now
have used it about a month now
twice a week or so
for a total of about 8 times
but three minutes in, my skin was burning.
it burned so much i couldn't even have it on the full ten minutes
after trying it for a few months
last time i'll use this product
wait a few minutes before applying makeup
after using for 2 weeks my skin looked worse.
i used this a few more times
using it in the day time
i've tried it a few times this week with different serums
used it for three days
i tried it for three days only to confirm the issue wasn't a result of my selected serums
used this for a week
i used that product, almost for 3 months.
night for almost two weeks now
off for a few weeks as i was slowly introducing it into my skincare
didn't realize it was this until i used it several days in a row
i tried this for weeks
i've only been here a week
a few days ago i went back to my old facial wash
after a couple weeks my skin looked absolutely awful
i broke out all over my face after using this for a couple weeks
then some only do for a couple days then i'm good
used it for almost a month
after about a week i noticed more
kept on for a month
after a few weeks i realized it was just breaking me out
after using it for 2 weeks
have been using this oil consistently for over a month now
the first month i had no issues
within a week of using this i was breaking out--
also watched a couple of videos about it
still have over half of it left
after using more than 1/2 the jar
didn't notice any difference after using it several times
even over time with use.
it only last for an hour
the next few times it essentially did nothing
i've only used it for about 3 weeks
then twice a week for a month

after using for two weeks i have not seen a difference in appearance
after about a week i've decided to return it due to the price
decided to give it another chance a few days later
i can't say that i'm seeing any kind of difference after two months of years
with additional sunscreen over top for four months
after using this product for several weeks i noticed that not only had my skin not improved
after using a couple of days in a row i did notice a glow
i finally succumbed to accutane a couple of years ago after trying everything under the sun for years to no avail
since i continued breaking out from the c firma i tried only using 2-3 times per week
i tried it for several weeks
it's very expensive item when it lasted only about two month didn't see any improvement
they said to stop using this for a week
unfortunately it caused breakouts within a few days
after a break of a couple of weeks after my skin had cleared
after 6 weeks of daily use i saw no difference
after just half a day
i used this for 4 months
after 4 months there was no improvement
i've struggled with breakouts for years
i didn't notice any difference after using this for a little over a week
after using it for a few days
the first few days i loved it
have been using it everyday since then
my face felt more oily during the days when i was using it
after using this face wash for more than six months i can honestly say i'm not impressed
it was fun to use the first few times
my skin has been breaking out more since i've began using it
tried this a few times using the suggested amount
this made me break out something that has not happened for 20 years
