luxurious cream to use- lovely texture
it had a funny smell, and a greasy texture.
definitely left a slightly blue/purple tint to my very fair skin
i swear this product tinted my skin purple/blue!
yes the product is "indigo"
most colored products don't actually color the skin
i loved the gentle color of this cream
the indigo line always leaves me feeling a little 'eh'
it is blue in color
i expected a more luxurious texture.
i liked the blue color
more like sits on skin and dries tacky and filmy.
it has a light oat scent
after using the tatcha indigo h
the smell of the cream is pleasant
skin has a gorgeous luster
i loved the fact that it was a silver shimmer
the mask smells like coconut.
the coconut smell is nice
the fake coconut smell really ruins it for me
first time i tried glam glow.
guess i won't be buying the glam glow limited edition sonic blue mask
my skin looked more radiant for sure
the mask smells delicious, like coconuts.
however i'd be willing to sample other glam glow masks
every glam glow product i've ever used my skin reacts too
it smelled like a pina colada which was fine.
i always love everything from glam glow
i love the smell of this mask!
my skin was bright red wherever the mask had touched my skin
the smell is very beach-like
with a fruity thing going on
almost smells like a tropical car wash or maybe a tanning salon minus the charred skin
the orange and blue are my fave!
the texture, the marshmallow smell.
while the chrome/silver aspect of it is cool.
adds a glow or something
i like the smell
the serum smells lovely
makes it feel silky smooth
i love fresh products
clinique advertises it as an instant awakening creme for the eyes
it's beautiful under makeup
left me eye area bright
it ends up cakey
i'd wake up with a tinge of brightness
pleasant on the skin
i love how this cleanser smells
i find this too creamy
really enjoying the sun coverage
this is a bit heavy for me, too creamy.
the texture is greasy
it is not pleasant
it made my skin feel like a glazed doughnut
it smelled like a creamsicle
this stuff makes my eyes so bright
smooth the appearance of my fine lines
does okay with light foundation/tinted moisturizer
get a couple silk pillowcases
help that gorgeous face of yours stay that way :)
i do enjoy the tingly effect of the product
turnaround overnight radiant lines
it does have a very satiny smooth finish
it has a light pleasant scent
the texture of this cleanser is very creamy
it has a nice fruity smell to it
my skin looked flawless
the smell is very sour like grapefruit or lemon which i kind of like
its cool that it's black
taut in the morning
definitely not wearable during the day
it's like weird cooking oil smell
i like the creamy texture.
this is a nice, thick moisturizer.
first of all, it smelled weird.
it's citrusy but with some awful top notes.
the scent is amazing.
the walnut scrub is my favorite.
i didn't enjoy the gloppy texture
it was not a pleasant feeling
i wish the raw sugar was more gentle.
it isn't as creamy in texture.
it was too creamy
fyi it smells like their warming cleanser
almost smells like paint.
product smells like pickles.
the scents a tad strong in the jar
good lort- the pelargonium graveolens flower oil
smells overpoweringly of old lady musty rose
scents don't irritate my skin either.
i like the concept of a charcoal mask
the scent is so strong
holy cow- it was so floral to me
made a awful bronzed orange colour.
using it as a primer it gives me a beautiful glow just as the lmercier radiance primer
just rock my tan
my fave looked beautiful
once i put it on it looked amazing to have a "natural glow"
i noticed it gave my skin a nice glow just a few nights after using
a subtle scent which i enjoy
i love the scent
it's overpriced for an oil blend
it's a lightweight, citrusy oil.
out there with more natural scents
it smells pleasant like lemon
nice blend of oils though.
it is a nice blend of oils
loved the citrus smell
it reminds me of orange glo furniture polish my mom used to use
legs to get a nice shine
there is a little smell to it that is kind of chemical smelling
felt very sticky and tacky on the skin.
it left my face feeling tacky
cooling but a little tacky after.
the smell is disgusting
it smells like cheese
le your face smelling like cheese
it also stays tacky on the skin
no minty or fresh feel at all.
for the cute look 2 stars.
my face was instantly shiny
i like the smell of this product
get something more creamy
it make my skin shiny
it's thin but not as creamy as i had hoped
it is not a fine mist at all
provide a pleasant spritz to the face
setting the cloth over your face so the warmth
i truly thought tarte was foolproof...
love all things tarte
i like the smell
i love the scent
has a light smell for the 2 stars
first, i love tarte products.
i love the fresh smell
my skin looks dull.
that pure plush was the new cleanser
this product also leaves my skin with a strange texture
slightly tacky to the touch
it is an ok cleanser with a pleasant enough earthy scent
the gelee is a cool concept
leaving it with a funky layer of stickiness on top
and the fragrance was a turn-off.
it made my face look shiny
the scent is okay
despite having oily skin it was incredible- my skin was luminous
it also gives me a nice radiant glow
it's a beautiful oil though.
i don't see any "brightness"
the oil smelled lovely the first couple of uses
as it seems to be the crown jewel of the korres line
like old rotting roses
this product is waaaaay too fragrant
although there is a somewhat pleasant frangrance at first whiff
the cream has a nice texture
it used to be rich, creamy, and lightly fragrant.
has a strong cheap-perfume smell
dry mature skin i need something creamier based.
i liked the light scent
tarte seems to have gone really downhill
this cream is tacky at first
made her skin glow
definitely didnt give me any type of glow
it smells like lemon nightmares.
it smells like a men's cologne.
the smell of this oil wasn't pleasant to me
it's rich in omegas
the burgundy red color of the whole line is not very appealing
clear glass with some colored flowers
the consistency of the creme is light
it also smells very light and pleasant.
lack of perfume smell on my face
it is smooth, smells nice, and absorbs quickly.
i do like the scent
love the smell as it is very subtle
power essence is a decadent moisturizer that will leave your skin feeing dewy
it has a nice fresh cucumber scent
it feels super lovely
it leaves a tacky feeling around my eyes
i enjoy this eye cream.
it smells like cucumbers :) and it's refreshing.
i loved the texture
no difference in "radiance" or anything
this mask is unremarkable, in my opinion.
using with a sun screen
silky moisturizer that won't grease you up then this is a good choice
even if the fragrance is natural
it was a little hard to take--sweet
the texture of the gel was very luxurious
when i put it on my face it was really floral smelling
i like the texture
the cream looks white in the photo
glow side by side
surprisingly the glow part didn't add much of a drama to the moisturize
the smell reminds me of old flowers
this was a nice illuminator mixed with foundation
it gave we a great dewy glow!
just wore this with finishing powder since this color complimented my tan so well
the shimmer stick on top and is a nice bonus.
leaves a dewy like complexion
felt that the "glow" made my skin too shiny
did add luminosity to my skin
the glow it gives is nice, but subtle.
it does leave a nice luminous glow to the skin
smelled odd as well
i received the beam team hydrate + glow complementary from the est√©e edit
while still leaving me a natural glow
i ended up looking over bronzed and fakey.
the rest of this line is so amazing at achieving a natural glow
that i'm sure this works wonders for anyone that isn't glowing white pale like i am
the beige color is also subtle
which is what i love as it gives you a hint of glow
i am not a fan of the shimmer
" which is a nude mauve
pigmented with a nice satin finish
it makes my skin look bright and alive.
this looked very ashy on me
the actual glow was very subtle!
can be used under foundation for a dewy glowy look
the builtin highlighter gives you even more glow
a nice highlight for your cheekbones
it added a nice dewy glow to make up
it has a satin finish which feels nice
the shimmer that comes along with it
it gives a very nice champagne shimmer color to the skin
immediately thought the color was beautiful
this is best suite a tan person.
this is a beautiful product
it made for a pleasant bonus
it gave a good glow
it gives a nice glow with your makeup
this is beautiful, if you have a tan.
when i have a tan
my fair skin since i've lost my summer tan
bedazzled, glitter bombed faces...
nice "glow" about it too
the product is lovely.
no scent which i like
it has a lovely velvety foam which was nice
it states that its not-scented on the bottle
i am not a massive fan of floral scents
this just smelt so strongly like roses
the smell was very overpowering
definitely a pass if you are the type of person that is sensitive to scents or isn't a fan of floral scents
it smells so lovely like roses
left my skin beautiful
it also makes my nose look so shiny
i found the rose scent to be pleasant
while it was creamy
if you like the scent of roses
i love all the rose fresh products
the scent is more like lotion than like rose water or anything floral
i like the rose smell
i just purchased the lotus cream
i love the fresh black tea line
it has that silky silicone feeling
gives the skin that beautiful healthy look
if anything it was less supple and radiant.
moist also bouncy w/a glow
it feels tacky on the face
stays tacky throughout the day
the natural scent of the ingredients is subtle
this was a unisex scent
smells nice, a little greasy (??)
the smell is just funky
this new version has an overpowering smell
it's very floral and it lingers.
you'll notice that funky smell
this one smelled like a strong men's cologne
the smell is an awful rotting smell
the first thing i noticed when trying this product for the first time is that it smelled very yeasty
it smells like flowers with b
the smell is intense
the smell was overpowering
the product smells fresh
it makes my skin feels a tinny bit fresher
it kind of oozes out with warning.
it is really subtle
it is a gold color
supple or other adjectives they may have claimed
my skin wasn't more radiant
it does have a strong scent
it looks so luxurious
the packaging is cute
it looks like glittery gold nail polish in the bottle
it also has fake little gold shimmer bits in it.
ma's over-powering floral scented perfume
it was lovely in color
i'd rather something smell earthy
it is very perfumed
smells like bad mens' cologne
a floral powdery scent to me.
if you like floral scents this may work for you.
the scent is giving me a headache
i love the glow it gives my skin
the scent is overwhelming
the best way for me to describe the scent is it smells like an old lady perfume
the scent is lovely
it feels tacky to the touch
this elixir reminds me of the overpowering stench of 7th grade boys drenched in axe body spray as they walk into class
the promises made are glorious
it's like a illuminating skin primer
i really don't need sparkly skin at night
the thought of sleeping with glitter on my face during the rejuvenating/healing time is unsettling
with glitter all over
the scent is strong--
not in my flavor wheel
this is scented, and has shimmer (in it).
i think the fragrance bothers me more than the shimmery ingredient
it is pleasant to use
the strong perfume smell
while the packaging looks luxe
i also like that it's gentle
eyeliner was chalky not creamy.
the color is a black blue
it is very strongly scented almost like cologne
the smell is very mushrooms
this product has a very strong perfume scent.
i wasn't keen on the scent
which reminded me of old floral water
i don't feel brightened.
it does make my skin more radiant and brightened.
leaves you with a magical glow
this will leave a shiny
i do think it brightens my complexion
i personally liked the earthy herb scent
it smells like an old person's house mixed with 20 years of stale cigarette smoke
it brightened my skin only because it has very fine shimmer in it
i enjoyed the cucumber smell
this product has a very nice lightweight gel formula which i love using in the summer plus a fresh smell that's pleasant
brightened my skin well
it also has a funny smell.
i did enjoy a kind of citrusy scent it had.
smells like lemon sorbet
it doesn't offer a nice glow at all!!
as another reviewer said appears to have a shimmery quality that isn't noticeable just looking at the cream itself
motherly like scent of it
the scent is strong rose
wow wow wow, this is heavily perfumed.
there is a light fragrance
while you may love the luxury feel of fragrance
i love the texture
despite it's aqua forming appearance
i do like the herby scent it has
found the scent to be very pleasant
not greasy or tinted
it has a very strong citrus-y smell
it has very fine subtle shimmer in it
refreshing against the skin
it had a delightful scent
i love lots of fresh products
i liked the texture
the rose they use smells so strange, like dill.
fine lines or radiance
infused with nourishing shea
it has a light pleasant scent which i appreciate since i am sensitive to scents
for this small bottle of beautiful smelling oil
the smell is disgusting.
it's awesome- smells like a vanilla cupcake
the scent was too overpowering
it smelled like men's aftershave
i like the texture of the product
the fragrance was nice
s felt like it was silk
two cons are the weird smell of the product
it does get cakey like.
as a lover of red wine
feels tingly and soothing but that's about it.
i like the tingle effect.
positives: cooling, smells nice, fairly gentle
i didnt get the "radiant" look its supposed to give you
it have a very minty sensation that sometimes gives you a minty burning sensation in the eyes
aside from the beautiful packaging
i noticed instant warmth on my face like an irritation
the scent is pleasant but very mild.
it smells better than witch hazel
i love my glam glow and origins .. took it back!
this has a pink pearly effect to it which looks nice on pale skin
would be gorgeous under makeup
not too shimmering as some said
this one was just oddly
surprising too sparkly in the sunlight
hate the matte feeling.
have a little glow without putting makeup on
i saw no glow whatsoever.
i love the glow/shimmer it gives
it is shimmery, sparkly and just not for me.
the scent of it was like cologne
this is very citrusy
on the richer texture
luxuriously feeling thick cream
0% smoothness, 0% brightness.. 100% oily look.
the cream smells like baby powder to me.
not in a pleasant way
feel very tacky to touch
slinky20141 out of 5flakes off
her skin is flawless
it has a very silk texture
it made my skin feel tacky
silky liquid for 30 days
a brightening cream that actually darkens
doesn't smell like chemicals or fake flowers
i love the texture of it
i like the texture.
unfortunately my dry skin was neither quenched nor radiant
this mask/face wash is too creamy
the glow is nice, very subtle.
want a dewy natural look sans any foundation
or on top of a tan
i like a good glow
the glamglow was a bit too shimmery without powdering it down
i love the glow it gives my skin underneath my foundation
perfect for summer glowy perfection!
nothing special, no glow.
i did smell like oranges
ordered the pearl shade thinking it would be great
very ice cream-y and sweet.
i know better than to buy something with glow or luminous in name
the glow and smell is incredible!
it gave my skin a beautiful glow
it's one of those fruity smells that gives you a slight headache
this moisturizer does give a nice glow
it was a beautiful shimmer under my everyday foundation
sparkles more than illuminates
this is very shimmery.
like middle school dance shimmery.
saw how beautiful the nude color blended in with my skin
this product in the deepest color gives me face a nice healthy tint without wearing makeup
it has some weird orange smell to it
i received this in my april sephora play beauty box in the shade nude glow
it also has a watery consistency
the glow is a little lack luster.
with an undertone of something rotten
i don't see any glow or illumination
if it's a glow you want
the product has a light tint to it
the pimples outweigh the pleasant scent
this smells exactly like an orange creamsicle
your skin looks radiant with it.
it's like someone took an orange creamsicle
amplified the smell with more creamsicle
if you want a good glow to your skin
it does give a beautiful luminosity to the skin
so on days where i need a glow
i combined it with my bliss tinted moisturizer upon my second attempt
***i feel that illuminating drops added to tinted moisturizer will achieve the same sought-after glow that this product gives for much less than $50
this moisturizer is jam-packed with glitter that instead emphasizes every nook
i loved the subtle illuminating effect
the bubblegum smell is too strong for a face product
the scent of this is very fruity
i love the scent
was so excited to use it because it's glam glow
this is a no go glam glow.
it didn't give me any glow
use it as a body moisturizer for a little glow
this stuff smells amazing i have the one in the nude glow
some sort of coconut white chocolate
end up looking downright shiny
this is beautiful for formal looks
you get a really nice glow
it's overly shimmery that just makes you look oily
the shade is flattering
setting spray it makes me shiny
this smells like a bath
body work creamsicle reject scent
i like the grittiness of the product
this cleanser is orange and it has an okay smell.
it's a nice cleanser and gently exfoliates.
smells a bit like peppers
the moisturizer feels beautiful on the skin
it has a strange, vinegary smell.
the smell is funky
it also made my nars sheer glow foundation ball up
very subtle, inoffensive scent.
it instantly makes my skin look matte
my makeup would look cakey
it goes on super grainy.
it has a strange consistency that's a cross between a moisturizer
3 stars for the strange smell.
i like the texture
dewy look i achieved after using my play
i love the dewy look
left me shiny all day
it has the consistency of frosting.
this eye cream sounds amazing
it was heavily perfumed to me
i also found the scent to be overpowering
because the scent was overpowering
this lotion smelled nice
the texture is pleasant
i liked the smell though, and the cute dispenser.
it has a masculine fragrance that i find too strong
it is a nice thick cream
it has a perfume scent
the smell is odd
woke up with three lovely new pimples
it's weightless on my skin
glittery/shiny is not the same thing as dewy!
made your skin luminous
the shimmer is perfect for a summer glow.
translate into something less misleading: radiance = glitter
your "glow" is only coming from the shimmer particles in this product
it gives a nice glow when you apply it
the gold in the gel gave me a glow
it wasn't really a glow
it has a tacky finish
it leaves your skin looking luminous
the packaging was so beautiful
with a little bit of shimmer in it
tacky for a good 15-20 minutes
it has beautiful packaging
leaves my skin feeling tacky
fell in love with the gold sheen of the moisturizer
i tend to go for subtle looks with mega highlight
the gold sparkles were nice
the gold sparkles in it were stunning
i liked the scent of the product
it also has shimmer .
it has gold glitter
it gives you a subtle glow
although i get the concept of the luminous look
i still looked shiny
i appreciated that it was gentle
makes them all watery
the smell made me really dizzy
this product overwhelming smells of alcohol
there is just a straight smell of vodka
glam glow mask does come with a brush
i honestly thinks the smoothness is from all the peach fuzz
the smell is overwhelming
the smell is almost unbearable.
only good thing about this is the metallic look.
sure the metallic copper is a cool look
the look of the orange was cool but that was it.
just splurge on the glam glow one
the charcoal and pink rose clay are great
gave it 2 instead of 1 because it's metallic
the metallic finish is really nice the alcohol smell is terrible
this product looks really cool since its rose gold
its a peel mask which is fun
its fun to see the copper color on your face
this smells like alcohol.
in fact it reminded me how nice a copper sheen makes my eyes look greener
it smells like a harsh vodka as soon as you put it on
the copper color is cool
it felt like i was breathing in a strong overpowering citrus fragrance
it dries to a beautiful bronze color
the smell really is overpowering.
mixed with an orange juice scent
the product is creamy, but not too thick.
i noticed this abundant greasy texture
for me the fragrance is overpowering
its more gentle then soap
perhaps the tannins were just too astringent for me
it has a very strong fragrant smell to it.
maybe too fragrant for this sensitive face?
it smells clean and minty .
first impression the smell
it felt greasy and made my face shiny.
it was very faintly scented
it's more chemically rosy type smell that i couldn't get used to
i love the light clean scent it has
it has cute packaging
it leaves my skin with a tacky feeling
my face remained shiny
my skin feels like silk day
i liked the texture of it which was sticky
has a strange burning/tingle to it
it smells like patchouli, my most hated scent.
this cream is heavily scented
it's like layering full-power old lady perfume on your face
i don't mind the scent
the scent reminds me of an over perfumed gr
i couldn't get past the strong perfumed scent
and the scent was overpowering to me.
leaves a very sticky/tacky feeling
it gives you a healthy skin glow.
i loved the lightweight formula and scent!
the sales associate said i would glow.
my moisturizer already gives me a nice glow
it smells like alcohol and cheap perfume.
this will give a glow to the skin before it dries up
this moisturizer seemed to work well providing a nice glow under my foundation
it has a strong scent of rubbing alcohol
unpleasant, almost musty scent.
love the scent of it
the fragrance is irritating
on the bright side it does give you a nice glow
my skin felt velvety smooth right after
the smell is fine
shine in the hot months
my skin looked shiny
the scent is noxious
this mousiurizer gave off a slightly pink illimunated glow that was very pretty
felt uninviting on my face
was hoping for a dewy or natural soft glow
the simmer makes my face look pink with hint of glitter
the glow it gives is nice
was initially impressed with the pink glow it gives skin
it looks like a quartzy holographic highlighter with some shimmer
it's beautiful when it comes out of the package
it had a beautiful pink iridescence to it that surprised me
it seemed to be the flakiest in the areas that were more luminous than others
it looked like i had dipped my whole face in holographic highlighter
this product leaves a beautiful glow
leaves a weird tacky/milky residue on your skin
the smell it has is unbearable
it has an overpowering sweet
it smells like a mix of old bay seasoning
the smell is very herbaceous from all the essential oils
on the bright side
especially when i'm at my palest
it's a very natural smell
the smell is disgusting!!!
it's like applying a ltasteless orange marmalade to your face
its chunky because of the fruity material
feel likes little pieces of orange pulp.
the smell is delicious if you like citrus
i appreciate the "freshness" of the mask since there are citrus pieces in it
it has a great citrus fragrance
citrusy and fresh great for a spa day mask.
like a citrusy fruity party all over my face
was definitely thrown by the chunky pulpy salsa consistency
it has a very pleasant, citrus smell.
the smell is natural
i love fresh mask
i didn't feel or notice any more vibrant/radiant like i do with other masques
it has a very refreshing smell
if you want to get a good mask try glam glow products
pulpy texture that is super sticky
despite the enchanting smell
it gave me more of a glowy/dewy look instead of a brightening
this one leaves my skin actually glowing
did not see an instant glow.
i love the scent
it literally feels like jam on your face with little apricot
the smell is pleasant
the texture is chunky
it smells like apricot jam or marmalade with the same consistency
it has the consistency of orange marmalade
it gives you a nice natural glow
the scent is too cloying
i liked the texture
it did give a slight pearly finish after application
in my opinion gives your face a much softer more natural glow
it has a brown color
what i found annoying is the very high percentage of radish root ferment
less on the radish
dewy glow to my face--
subtle glow, strong herbal scent.
the glow is more golden than pink.
i like the texture
the level of glow is dim
find this to be very aggressively herbal with pungent sour grassy notes rather than floral or citrus
everything that claims to "illuminate" the face since i love having glowing skin
my skin just looked shiny
it's not floral or anything nice
is farrrr too shimmery for individuals with medium to dark skin tones
this product is very shimmery
it does "brighten" my eyes
it does brighten under my eyes
it left uneven pearlescent streaks
slightly iridescent eye cream that doesn't do as much as tata's other eye creams
it leaves a whites film on the eyes i like how it's shimmer
seriously along the lines of a semi-subtle liquid highlighter or illuminating primer
the product itself is a beautiful opal color
and the smell is nauseating.
i love how bright it makes my skin first off.
the color is an opalescent white which is pretty
ok so the made my face glow.
while i find it pleasant to use
finer than in a micro-glitter eye shadow
while some may like this "lit from within" type of shimmer
which performed beautifully on my skin
this feels luxurious on my skin.
the warmth of it on my skin is very relaxing
the only thing i enjoy about this mask is how creamy it feel
the warming sensation it gives
it did get creamy when rubbed in
it's fun to see the texture change from goopy honey to milky cream
as you message it into your skin it quickly turns to a white creamy like texture that's easy to apply
there is a slight honey like scents that does linger on as the mask sits on the skin
it was bright, silky smooth and plump.
the tingling sensation was nice.
because i love the texture
it has a smokey smell which isn't my favorite.
i liked the warming sensation
my skin is glowing
it felt sticky like honey and smelled nice.
it comes in a beautiful jar
flaky in the winter
while i felt the tingle
i like the color
i found the warming effect pleasant
purchased this mask after seeing the beautiful packaging
the gooey texture on my face was not very pleasant
it does brighten the skin
not because of the slightly sulfurous smell
the smell of the sulfur was so strong
gives only a nice glow.
no highlighter appearance, no glow, no shimmer.
did not leave a luminating glow as the product described
i expected something to give a glow-it didn't.
then my radiance primer as opposed to this slightly shimmery moisturizer
it made my skin look very sparkly
this glotion is much to shimmery
smells the same, a lovely light rose scent.
it smells like bad cucumbers.
this product is gentle on skin
this milky one isn't terrible
however, the smell was overpowering.
i hate the smell of celery
i like the way this is gentle
it smells strongly of old perfume
the scent of this product gives me a headache
it is so overpowering.
the fragrance is a super strong cologne type smell that i found overpowering
like artificial herbs and flowers.
points for cute packaging though!
that feeling is pleasantly weird
i found the smell
this is a nice smelling, well cleansing wash.
the packaging is gorgeous however
it does leave my skin very bright
the good: -smells wonderful-very gentle on skin
love the glass bottle
i noticed that on my oily areas this worked beautifully
the texture is light and the scent is lovely.
it does have a very pleasant scent
it smells very natural and light.
leaves a weird film on my skin
the packaging is chic.
it still looks very cakey
so trying to blend it into my neckline is a nightmare
this product makes my skin too pale
this product is for the people who have pale skin
i tried to blend it
this product isn't meant for very pale people.
this product was about 5 shades too dark for me
it made my skin look very pale
it covers redness beautifully.
the shade did not blend at all with my fair skin
i am a very pale natural redhead.
a fine mist of setting spray
it still sometimes looks a bit "cakey"
my complexion is fair/light
it needs to have a more pleasant smell.
this one smells rancid
i like the way it turns from a balm to a little milky
the citrus smell is okay at first
milky texture it doesn't set matte
leaving my complexion looking dull
brighten my under eyes
my dark circles looking even darker
i like the texture
and it works beautifully with the first few uses.
it went from a dreamy whipped bouncy texture to yet another murky thick curdled mess in a jar
i give this cream 3 stars for thick creamy texture
i noticed nothing "magical" with this cream despite the claims
i switched to this eye cream from the fresh black tea eye cream because the fresh one is very expensive
i like its texture
this cream smelled exactly like bathroom cleaner
while a nice citrus scent
it is super tacky.
i smelled like men's cologne.
the smell is nice, kind of citrusy.
to me it's a ginger/lemon scent.
the scent of the cream
this product has a lovely spa-like smell to it
it takes forever to blend in
the consistency is very creamy
the slight tint it gives
since this is tinted
it could possibly be the tint in it
im pale so this won't work for darker skin tones
the "beige" color was darker than my porcelain/ivory skin
when i saw myself in the mirror with natural lighting
it was so pale
the color was fine
it dries down very dark and orange tinted.
it's basically greenish white foundation
everything that touches your face will have some tan transfer
the white residue would not blend with my skin.
it's a creamy green color that goes on effortlessly
it did do a beautiful job of correcting my redness
boscia's charcoal peel off brightening mask was great-
felt greasy and smelled somewhat bad.
the smell was unpleasant
i loved the texture
has no harsh smell
my tarte lights camera flashes mascara was still on
i like the texture
it does have a faint rose geranium (?)
it smells like cheap chemical
the scent is so overpowering
it smells like baby powder with flowers.
i don't mind scents
it doesn't feel like cashmere
the scent is fairly pleasant.
your skin certainly feels cashmere soft instantly after using it
it's like olive oil gone bad
this is a nice, gentle moisturizer.
really subtle vanilla scent that is barely there
the smell is not pleasant
kind of a weird plant smell
this cream feels luxurious
it has a repulsive smell!
the smell is unpleasant
i don't like smelling it throughout the day
the formula itself was very creamy
as soon as i smelled the earthy
nutty scent i knew what this "single
this cream felt soothing
had to wash it off immediately because the floral/powdery scent is so overwhelming
but the smell seemed kind of funky to me.
the smell is overpowering
the oil smells like olive oil
it has a weird old cosmetic smell to it
noticed by face was super shiny
i think i was expecting rich creamy moisturizer
there is a faint smell of lavender
i liked the texture of the cleansing oil.
ok the bright side
the packaging and product itself are lovely!
first thing i noticed was the beautiful packaging
the packaging is beautiful
i liked the luxurious feel of the bar
the silky feeling of the cleansing oil
glowing after using this product
the scent that was noticeable wasn't very good smelling
gentle on my skin
the bar soap isn't harsh
it makes my skin feel like velvet
i think it's the epitome of chic
the texture reminds me of the benefit porefressional
the powder turns into a foamy mask which is an interesting texture
the mask does not smell like matcha at allÔºÅit smells terrible‚Ä¶
the smell was unbearable
the way the mask smells
the texture is too thick / hard to blend
dark shade under eyes
this product above all had a nauseating smell.
i expected a creamy foamy wash like the fab cleanser which i love
this has a funny smell
this was just watery
i know honey is naturally pretty fragrant
the scent is almost overpowering
this balm is wonderful in the morning before putting in my earrings
the smell of honey was overwhelming for me
it doesn't smell like honey or anything sweet
it smells kind of musty.
it mixes to a frothy liquid
this stuff is straight up iridescent glitter!
makes you sparkle, not glow..
it does make my makeup sparkle
makes it glow brighter
s looking like a sparkly mess
gave me a clear highlighter which i loved-
once i entered natural light the product was all sparkles
"natural looking glow" in the description made me laugh
this stuff made me sparkly.
this is a beautiful illuminating moisturizer
it is so sparkly
it does give your skin a subtle illuminated look
love tarte, but just no.
this moisturizer is loaded with fine multicolored glitter
it is not illuminating
just coats your face in sparkle
i actually like shimmery stuff for every now
my skin is olive and this is way too pink.
and the shimmer is too pearly for my taste.
the highlight is a shimmery sheen
i also can't see the shimmer being shimmery enough to use as a highlighter
it is very glittery
i literally glow like a twilight vampire.
about 10% of the glow would've been nice
glitter was everywhere and formula felt tacky.
rest of the face looks beautiful under makeup.
like tarte would have a product like this at all
the weird sheen it gives is very off putting
i ended up looking sort of metallic
way too shiny/glittery for me!
i realized it was a pink tint with tons of glitter
plus i'm more yellow toned
the pink tint didn't work for me
it was super creamy
a very abundant amount of glitter!
doesn't give you that refreshed glow!
want some glow to my skin
it does nothing to add a glow to your makeup
it's like an explosion of glitter
it left my skin way too shiny for my taste
there was glitter everywhere
glitter bomb or glowy sheen
it wasn't just a sheen
because the light catches on distinct glitter particles
reflects in this pink
not like a finely milled highlighter
the pros: lots of holographic glitter
looks gorgeous in sunlight
this product is pure glitter
that's the "illuminating" effect!
it seemed like after it dried it went from a cute sheen to a claire's glitter explosion on my face
the sparkle that seemed to be on my h
i do however love tarte makeup
it really was reminiscent of the twilight movies.
it's glitter not shimmer.
this is crazy glittery
you can see the sparkles
too much shine and sparkle for me.
it does have tiny particles of shimmer.
i do like using it top of cheekbones for a glow
i also blend a cream highlighter on top of brighter days for even more intensity
like the look for what i'm using it for inspire of the sparkles
really wish tarte would have eliminated the sparkles in this highlighting moisturizer
it is way too shimmery
the sparkles look white on your face
had to rub it in vigorously to make it not look sparkly white
it has straight up chunky glitter in it
not in a "sparkly" way
maybe in a shimmery way
in my opinion it's not sparkly
until i looked at my face in bright lighting
it accentuated all of my skin texture
it also has a fine micro glitter that looks very obvious in bright lighting
this was a sparkling glitter bomb.
the sparkles stay on your h
but this tarte one is surprisingly small.
i ordered this from tarte
this tarte comes out whitish pinkish
like i said sephora is a creamy beige more with skin color
i love anything shimmer
for reference my skin color is is light with neutral undertones
has a gold micro glitter.
it does have glitter in the formula or shimmer
has shimmer in it which i don't like at all
old lady perfume smell
to me it just looked like awkward shiny under eye skin
i like the smooth texture of this product.
it has the texture of a primer
it is lightly scented & i love that.
i don‚Äôt like to put scented cream on my face
i do like the scent of the eye cream.
shimmery finish which was great for highlighting during the day
i like the shimmer color it has to it
its a very thick cream similar in texture to a moisturizer something rich you would use at night
i love the lanc√¥me face blur
eyeshadow colors showed more vibrantly
it's a thick unique texture that melts into a cool
i love the fresh products
my skin feels nice and silky but that's about it.
this product is loaded with irritating fragrance.
the fragrance is so strong!
with a high astringent note
was expecting a citrus kind of smell
it smells like stale vinegar
it smells like strong vinegar.
my foundation looked crackly
my skin looked dewy
it has some shimmer to it
it left a tacky feeling
it made the foundation textured
not sure how i feel about the shimmer/tint
it even made my super pale self look kind of tan because it almost seemed like it had some pigment in it
the light hint of humor highlight in the product
you know, that cheap watery pink soap???
it made my face look shiny
my biggest complaint is that it is shimmery
it gives me a hydrating glow
it smells lovely, light scent.
it has fine shimmer which unfortunately clings to texture
i also loved how it made my face glow from within
the sample made me glow
i like the smell
the product smells faintly of coconut water which isn't bad
makes my skin dewy
green tea micellar waters
the green tea smells pleasant
the scent is a fake rose smell
the scent makes me nauseous
with it being grey-tinged
might try other scents.
leaves my face feeling somewhat film-y
it's that typical pinky iridescent tone
does not feel luxurious
my foundation alone wears beautifully
the scent was nice and it smelt very luxurious.
it added a little more of a glow to my skin
felt to creamy for a mask.
soothing that i prefer to this one
i liked its texture
i received clarin's hydra-essentiel silky cream complimentary for testing/review purposes from influenster
it has the sorbet like texture
the smell is so overpowering though and lingers.
sort of get a hair spray vibe
is pleasant application experience
i loved the texture of it
while i love the texture of this product
while at first i loved the texture
i love the that it has 47 spf & and is tinted.
get very tan in summers
the color is off for my tone
i rather be shiny than red.
gives a sort of ruddy looking cast to the skin
the tint of this stick is darker than what it appears online
it made my fair skin look orange-y
it looks light with pink undertones in the picture
it's more like medium with golden undertones
i am uber pale
if this came in a paler shade
the shade was too dark for my light skin color
is too fragrant for me
then use a translucent setting powder
not like greasy shiny
shiny even through my matte foundation powder
although the added heavily-floral fragrance that's found throughout the clarins line may feel luxurious to you
my face looks/ feels more textured
the perfect swirls made me happy
the packaging is cute
when i open the jar it's very gorgeous
imagine like 2 flavors ice cream in a jar
rather than the regular nutty scent of argan oil
i also like the texture.
i really like the smell and texture of the cream.
your skin looks glowy
reeks of an artificial orange room spray that makes me nauseous
smells good tho and hydrates.
i loved the scent
it smells like an orange creamsicle
i like the smell
my skin looks as shiny as an oil slick
it made my skin bright and it smelled so good.
i still had that glow though
it seemed so luxurious
had a nice refreshing scent
it smells a little fruity
it also doesn't help that it comes with a faint orange tint
the orange creamsicle scent was cloying
super shiny and just gross.
for the first hour you are wearing it you can smell the fruitiness of the lotion
over powering orange scent
i love the smell of coconut
it didn't have a natural or even sweet fragranced coconut scent that i was expecting
this product has a strong scent
its more bubbly than foamy
some pros of this product are: fresh mint smell
the scent is refreshing
a less-than-pleasant scent
it's very very thick and creamy.
the texture is chalky
the perfume is also overbearing
it's lightweight and dries to a powdery finish.
sadly just can't tolerate the overwhelming floral perfume they scented it with :
this has a super heavy scent
the scent smells almost artificial
it has a tacky formula
the blend of this oil sounded promising to me
it has been quiet good at nothing happened to my face like reddish pimple or spots
my skin ends up looking pale
especially the tea tree
the packaging is cute.
i love the minty smell
it's like a minty smell
the scent is strong
i enjoyed the scent
ole henriksen just sounds so exotic
smells maybe a bit to earthy
i will say that the minty smell
the smell is super overpowering
i always felt shiny by the afternoon
does give an instant matte finish
this left a tingly feeling and a matte finish.
also with the same lovely scent that the other balance products have
i loved the way it smelled
i love the refreshing scent of this product.
it has a quite strong tea tree kind of scent
i like the smell and the consistency.
family said that my face looked dewy
i love the texture
it's almost like a musky smell
i love the texture, it is so light and smooth.
the only shade that really matched my skin was the darkest shade
i still don't fully believe that a tinted moisturizer product can be a tint
my fingers to blend the product
i couldn't stop sneezing from the strong perfume scent
it is also highly fragrant
gives the skin a very subtle glow
i liked the fresh smell
it is a sour tangy scent that lingers
it sinks in beautifully
went on well and made my skin look bright.
it reminds me of cooking oil except the scent of farsali is citrusy
i liked the fersali gold elixir
the scent was fairly pleasant
it smelled like oranges
the gold flakes are neat
i like this for a luxurious touch
while i feel it is lovely
just another beauty oil
smells like old cooking oil.
only 3 months after purchasing this elixir the fresh citrus smell went away
now the oil smells like pungent chemicals
smelled like cooking oil.
it also has a weird lemon scent.
smells like cooking oil
my skin looked more radiant
it smelled so luxurious
creates a textured finish with makeup
i love the rose gold elixir
the unicorn essence does not only have a magical name
it is also gorgeous to look at
the smell is divine
i did not find the sweet vanilla scent overpowering
nor did i find the product's pink glitter coloring to st
the fact it's a pink color
the packaging is beautiful
its cute that the oil is pink
mine doesn't smell sweet it smells like chemicals
i love sweet smells
cool color of the product
makes my skin look radiant
while on paper it sounds wonderful with all of the superfruit extracts
helps provide a natural glow under your constructed complexion
smells like fruit loops
plus the smell is disgusting.
smelled like candy felt like water.
the product looks beautiful
there is a shimmer to it
buuuut if you don't really like sparkle/shimmer
this made my skin tacky
y smell" is not natural- it's added fragrance
the color is captivating.
this for the sake of sparkle
is a cool glowy pink color
sparkly eye shadows pop
so sparkly buuuuttt it made my face break out
its sparkly pink format
i didn't like the glitter or purple color
my skin felt tacky afterwards
f you're sensitive it has fine glitter/sparkles in the formula
i like that it is a purple bottle
it comes out a pink color
it also has a scent
it just looks like pink watery glitter
it is a nice primer due to the tacky texture it leaves
and i like sweet scents
while this product does give some glow
this product didn't give me a dewy glow
does not have the luxurious feel
i just lost my vibrancy
i feel like i have to tug at my skin to blend this out
it also leaves you looking very shiny.
its kind of like licorice
the product also lect my face shiny
my face was shiny in 3 hours.
this creme hydrating my skin beautifully
it had this tingly menthol feeling
foul smelling reformulation of their beloved classic sorb√©t creme
it's texture was sublime.
excellent hydra life pro-youth creme sorbet
the fragrance is the same
the fragrance in this product is so overpowering
it does have a strong perfume scent
fragrance is a bit too overpowering.
i like them to have a silky feel
it has a pleasant herbal scent but not for $42!
the fragrance sticks around for a while
it has a lemon grass smell to it
for a mask that claims to brighten
it didn't make my skin look glowy or radiant.
the rubbery texture was something very interesting
the appearance was cool
refreshing on the skin
at the start the warming tingling sensation was amazing
it left a tacky feeling on my face
i ordered moist lover/ hydration lover
first, it smells weird.
it felt so luxurious when i put it on
2 stars because the smell is light and lovely.
i also liked the texture.
it sounded nice "the water cream"
made my cheeks bright red/ sensitive
why they put a cologne smelling scent in this?
it leaves a nice cooling sensation when applied.
i love the texture
this product dispenses weird.
the oil is blend
this product has a very distinct, pine scent.
they have a literal dark purple hue.
i love the silky texture
the texture is silky and easy to apply.
no colors or perfumes
there is no scent to this
it felt very silky
good texture and smells fresh.
had such a nice glow
it has no scent
loved the smell of the cleanser.
it was like glitter
seems to be the cool girl ecoconscious alternative to more natural products
coupled with the issue of this product not being as vibrantly green as on the sephora website
this cleanser smells kind of weird
my skin looked radiant after i used it
loved the blue metallic color when the light strike
has a very pungent blueberry smell.
i should have known when i smelled the scent
i enjoy the smell
especially with the metallic blue colour.
smell is like old leaves mixed with mint or similar to earthy essential oil
the first thing as soon as i opened it was this overwhelming herbal/musky smell
i got the luxe sample
i actually quite enjoy the aroma.
it soaps up nicely
it feels beautiful while applying
well the ball is swishy
i love the texture of this fun cleanser bouncy bar
i find the smell unpleasant
definitely recommend the yellow mask though!
more like a creamy cleanser where the stock gets gummy
it smells exactly the same as the glamglow glow starter nude moisturizer
i love fresh products
no glow at all.
it does smell like a watermelon jolly rancher
the scent is heavenly.
it has an amazingly fresh watermelon scent to it
it smells like watermelon heaven
i love the glow recipe site
the scent is amazing
give me a bright pink pimple on my cheek
does not make me glow.
just smells like watermelon jolly ranchers.
i normally like what the glow recipe team delivers
this smelled more like acid to me than blueberries
it smells/has the consistency of that
first the smell is weird
it has a bit of a smell to it
it smells like spicy sausage or onions
peppers with a hint of orange
it litteraly smells like sausage.
this just smelled like a strange cleaning product
or something awkward smelling
it is very perfumey
it looked really beautiful in the jar
it has a glossy texture
it also had a fruity scent i did not enjoy.
it leaves a weird slick
very overwhelming floral scent.
wanted to love this moisturizer as the packaging is beautiful
my skin just glows
it's the perfect face cream.
it's scent is heavenly.
second, the thick, creamy texture is to die for!
i really love the fresh scent of this product.
kind of giving you a more matte complexion
although the packaging is gorgeous
no glow at all
did not deliver the glow i wanted instead i think the glow this product promises is more like an oily dew not a healthy glow
and it oddly smells like nair.
it's got natural citrus aha's
it has a strong scent
the packaging is luxurious
the mask is a lovely lavender colour with a very subtle
i love that it is purple
leave you with glowing skin after use
lasting glow with continued use
the packaging is beautiful
however, this is a more gentle texture.
my skin looked pretty luminous
my foundation colour usually includes the word "caramel"
i loved the way this skin tint felt on my skin: silky
i would definitely recommend this skin tint
the color light is too pink
out of the bottle it looked quite yellow
this made my skin glow
the smell is light
not the earthy/spice i anticipated from the turmeric
as the product claims to help with textured skin
gave my skin radiance upon application
it has a strong fragrance that smells like my gr
it's highly scented to me
i loved the texture
this is a really soothing fragrance
while my skin was creepily soft it also broke me out
most serums are all natural filled with wonderful oils
to immediately be hit with a strong perfume scent
the smell was pleasant
the scent is a nice scent
it will make your skin glow.
my skin felt tacky for a bit
it also smells faintly of vinegar.
product gave a little tingle
the only upside to this product is my skin does look more radiant
i really liked the thick texture
i really liked the creamy texture
the orange scent it has is too artificial smelling for me
the smell is just heavenly
the sweet smell of nurture me
- the scent is overpoweringly sweet
if you are not a fan of sweet scents
while it smells divine
i think it smells like orange creamsicle.
the problem is the scent.
the smell is pleasant but a bit over powering.
my skin would literally be glowing
the texture was fine
it smelled very strong...a creamscicle.
colors into this formula
the smell isn't nearly as pleasant as the red tea cleanser
at which point i knew it was time to say goodbye to this delicious smelling cleanser :
leaves me silky smooth
i like the smell
this cleanser has a strange consistency.
it has a "gooey" texture
i gave this two stars only for its brightening qualities
the smell was overpowering
the scent is a little strong.
the scent and texture is amazing.
had an almost watery weightless feel to it
gave it a glowing look
or smooth out the texture
the smell wasnt pleasant at all
matte powder i was shiny
didn't boost my skin's radiance at all.
i felt this stinging sensation
with so many other lovely serums out there
which i think is green tea?
it smells like artificial orange sweetener.
make my skin smell like oranges
i love anything with any green tea
natural moisturizer that smells generally inoffensive
they make my skin glow and feel so dewy.
the smell was unappealing for a cream
the smell was strange
it does have that hint of cucumbers
i enjoy the light natural smell
this is a lovely smelling cream
it smells like eggs
please change the scent.
the scent of my new jar is almost unbearable to me
it was almost like a tea tree oil smell
the scent was overwhelming
it gives me a youthful glow.
the color was like a dark yellow
i love the texture
the unpleasant fragrance of the moisturizer is very overwhelming to me
the fragrance of this is too floral
for that reason i will continue my search for the magical moisturizer
it smells like an orange
it smells like stink.
it's like smelling bleach mixed with s emen
lovely way to start your day.
the smell of this product :
i remember it being a richer silkier cream.
the luxurious creamy feel it had before was not there this time
this gives me a whipped and fake texture.
it has a strong scent that smells gross
the fragrance was a bit irritating
the smell lingers for hours blah
doesn't mind strong scents that linger
however, the scent (lavender maybe?)
it isn't runny, but not too creamy either.
it doesn't have a pleasant scent
i still have a very shiny tzone
weirdly enough seemed to make my skintone more uneven
on the smile lines
the dark circle is absolutely lighter.
the texture of my skin
awesome cucumber spa like smell
its fresh and has the unique lotus smell.
i liked the texture
i love the scent of it.
i loved the smell and texture of the creme.
it feels like a milky gel
this cleanser is indeed gentle
the texture is milky
this product has a nice creamy feel on the face
has a nice, light floraly/herbaly fragrance.
the consistency was liquidy
not creamy like it usually is
i loved the gentle cleaning milk
old formulation removed my mascara beautifully
it was lovely--"what i'd take to a desert isl
this new formula has a funny smell.
didn't have this with the gentle cleaner product
i've used the gentle cleaner and loved it.
it has an odor to it
caudalie please bring back the original gentle cleanser
specifically the funky smell
this new version leaves a weird greasy film on my skin
new one smells odd
switched to a mud to foam cleanser from glam glow
it's really silky feeling going on
smoothness under my eyes
a lovely green tea scent
this gel cream has a very silky
blue vessels shining through
i wanted an eye cream that would brighten
my eyes felt silky but looked a little dry.
and it leaves the undereye area looking shiny.
the smell is overwhelming
it has a strong scent that smells artificial.
the scent is pretty strong, smells like roses.
which smells like oranges
i like the smell of roses
i would rather be dewy than matte.
i like the light floral scent
not in a youthful taut way
it claims to be gentle
it did not smell pleasant either
shiny after i used it
one thing that i don't like about this is that it's fragrant
slightly fragrance combined to make just a weird scent
everyday cleanser with a pleasant smell
it's not sweet like other philosophy products
it has a terrible bitter taste like dish soap
it smells just like my boxed hair color.
the smell is horrid
it produces a gentle foam
it's gentle on my skin
it was gentle with those
it says it is soothing
the smell is not very cool since it's unscented
the smell is a weird smell.. like an old cupcake.
look shiny after application
makes my skin super shiny and super taut.
besides the funky odor
it just smelled weird
soothing on my skin
an overall pink undertone to my skin
my skin flushed bright red within moments of application
while the ingredients in this light eye cream sound good
tingles nicely when first applied.
this eye cream goes on nicely
it smelled seriously funky
it leaves an unnatural sheen behind
though the tint provides a little lightening effect
i love the idea of natural ingredients
it also smells ashy
ascetic wise it was a large bar with a dry appearance
pros: it is gentle on the skin
it is gentle and smells lovely.
smells like straight tofu.
it was a thicker milky consistency which i liked
loved the fresh cucumber scent
this wash i found to have a nice smell
but it smells like cilantro.
it smells really strong like toasted soy beans
freshly squeezed green juice
usually use lush dark angels or herbalism
love my fresh rose mask
there is a really eye watering strong scent of wintergreen mint to this
this creamy face wash feels so good on the skin!
i love the subtle scent
first i have to say i love the light fresh smell.
all i had been wearing was tinted moisturizer
smells kind of like cilantro too
it feels silk to the touch
my skin was still tacky
while the smell was lovely
it also smells odd.
my skin was so textured
the smell is delicious
the result was a nice matte supple face
like orange creamsicle and spreads nicely.
nice glow however the ingredients are no good
shiny during the day
the glow was nice though!
it leaves it feel tacky
i would say this is definitely more matte than glow
the scent, while pleasant, is very strong.
i love the smell of all glam glow stuff
it smelled so strong like i put scented body lotion all over my face
it does smell delicious
it smells delicious though.
smells strong like lemon sherbet which idk if that's a good or bad thing
i don't mind the scent
like i leave the house matte
it leaves my skin feeling tacky
gave me a slight glow
it does beautifully brighten the complexion
no difference in dark spots or radiance
smell is not pleasant
this explains the softness/calmness
it also smells like the water in a vase after you take out dead flowers
or for radiance overall
this serum has a lovely texture
le a very gritty exfoliator
it was very gritty and not "gentle" at all!
they turned bright red
my skin feels refreshing
rich, depuffing, smelled like roses!
not to mention, it's olive scent is horrible.
my search continues for the perfect dark circle eye cream
right underneath my eyes it turned bright red
its pretty rich + luxurious
the tube says it "brightens
my skin does not look more radiant or smooth.
smells like baby powder almost.
i usually use a radiance primer
because the glow/radiance comes mainly in the form of shine
smells like a very intense baby powder.
my face is dewy
it gives alot glow
it gives you a luminous finish
radiant when i step off the plane
does give you a subtle glow
it's got a perfumey, really heavy fragrance.
i love the smell and feel of this balm.
the smell also isn't very pleasant.
the formula is very milky
and it smells like a little boy's cologne.
my face looks shiny
i like the smell :
perfect for my oily/combo skin
the smell is unbearable the consistence is too thick to blend on my face
it has an intense scent
tea tree oil has a strong herbal smell
i hate products that initally feel silky
it would be the pores no more--fabulous pore "filler"
is a very gooey consistency
i like the scent
it smelled like weird chemicals
i think the scent of the sleeping facial is pleasant
i found the scent to be nauseating
the gel created a tingle
for the money i was expecting a more silky feel.
it smells like baby powder
turned my skin bright red
it has a weird powdery smell
this cream is way to rich
the daytime version smells pretty
it smells like raw potatoes.
the scent is mild
this product has a noctural scent
it's a thick cream that make me look shiny
flaky underneath with this layer of creamy shine sitting on top :
i like the smell
this is very creamy
it smells about as delicious as a bottle of cheap off br
leaves skin looking shiny
didn't make my skin glow like origins or philosophy
it has a waxy texture i'm not fond of
the orange scent wasn't too strong to me
it smells citrusy at first
it smells like an orange air freshener mixed with dirty motel smell
use powder to control the shine
the smell is strange
to me it smells like a mix between oranges
it's a little too sweet
fragrant for my taste
when first applied it looks shiny
it has a citrus scent that is not offensive.
it smells like a slightly-medicinal creamsicle
the scent became distracting
because i loved the orange smell
which is citrusy in a chemical way
the smell was energizing
it is scentless, the sample smelled great.
texture were pleasant enough
also, the texture is not as creamy as i like.
the balm is creamy
it does smell super strong of lavender
you really have to love lavender...
no fireworks or tingling
i love the lavender scent
there was an incredibly overwhelming smell of lavender
the texture is weird
this is a good calming mask.
"berries" sounded very attractive
this enzyme mask is very heavily scented of lavender
it also has a very overpowering lavender scent
my skin felt like silk
it is very creamy
lovely thick eye cream
i found it not creamy at all
i love the smooth texture.
this one is creamy.
mpressed with this product- not as creamy
silky as i thought it would be nor absorbing
you think hydrating & creamy.
it smells like an old woman's cheap perfume.
has an odd smell
i fail to see a longed-for plumpness
moisturized glow in the morning
was very liquid-y rather than creamy
i adore the sleeping facial
the smell is kind of strange.
gave my skin a weird feeling and left a residue
i smelled like sour milk/yogurt because of it
peels in a weird way
i prefer the rose scented one as it has brightening effects
both the scents aren't that strong
the texture is a little odd
it's thick, creamy and absorbs slowly.
it is very creamy
it is outrageous that an upscale br
it reminds me of a sticky lipgloss
it's the opposite of creamy
lip cream for it's gentleness on the skin
i wanted a an eye cream that would blend easy
the texture is not very creamy, but it is thick.
it was a rather dark beige.
turned out the tester was also beige in color
it is a luxurious feeling cream.
it leaves my face too shiny
i like that its a matte finish
there was nothing distinctive about this cream.
brighten the eye area
the cream is a nice texture
this creamy/foamy cleanser is not the best for my skin
after 2 splashes i can still feel the creaminess on my skin‚Ä¶ after 4th then that's when my skin feels "squeaky" clean
it seems like the astringent properties in the cream only emphasizes my lines
i like this product it brighten my eyes
warmed on skin it emits a chemically smell
i love how cute it looks in the pale yellow color
horrible horrible scent for a non-scented product
it's a nice mask with a pleasant rose scent.
it glides nicely on your face.
it looks freshly made.
the two stars is a personal dislike for chunky masks
need to relax with a glass of wine
i like the smell of this product.
it's an olfactory assault with rose petals
pieces of rose petal in it are so gross to me
i love the way this mask smells!
mask with rose petal pulp that smells just like roses
the fact that it has real rose petals
you can actually see the rose petal pieces in the mask
this has a nice gentle scent
after using it i found it gave me a bit of a glow
it doesn't have that powdery synthetic rose scent which i appreciate
it's smells more like fresh cute roses.
three stars for the scent
refreshing feeling on the skin
other than smelling good
it makes me very shiny and it stings my eyes.
after a particularly sunny day my face was roasted red
on the bright side
i wasnt out in the sun
the perfume scent is very strong
it is a nice, light lotion though.
its improved the texture and tome of my skin.
the scent took me some time to warm to
the search for perfect spf eye cream continues
it's very creamy and whitish.
i like the creamy texture
though it felt creamy in the application
the product is creamy
the scent is disgusting
it smells really nice, subtle and fresh.
product itself is really gentle and foamy.
it's a very gentle cleanser
i like the smell and the gentleness.
smells great and very gentle on my skin.

to me the eye cream is too pearlescent

although it doesnt have a strong scent
it left my eyes feeling soft and subtly radiant.
the eye cream reminds me of the scent of clay
ingredients seem to instantly brighten under my eyes
the color is almost like a foundation bur very sheer
it may be a combination of the ingredients or because of the "iridescent" tint to the cream
the cream has a light peach tint to it which appears to be how they cover up the under-eye circles

the scent is just revolting
the tingling feeling is nice
at first i was captivated by the smoothness of my skin with application
because of the grey tint as others have mentioned
there is very obvious shimmer in the black gel

it's so rich it feels luxurious on your skin.
this cream feels light

smells a little strange also.
it is a cream-gel and has a blue tint to it.

i didn't like the tint to it
which actually accents my fine lines
there is no magic potion for dark circles

somewhat resembles the smell of fresh thatch
this thing smells like chemicals.
i'll stick w the orange and purple type.

almost like it was airbrushed
maybe the other glam glow masks are better

the bottle and smell were nice!
leave out the lavender oil
the packaging is lovely.
this one felt pretty luxurious
while creamy and sudsy when it when on.
what i liked about this product: creamy

the lotus face cream will be a better choice :

easily absorbed with pleasant rose scent
the texture of the product is weird
it does smell like roses
the only thing i like is the sweet smell.

if you like a heavy cream with a pleasant perfume smell

it does nothing for the bluish cast that some of us have
it has a nice creamy consistency
liked the idea of a dark circle minimizer
the wonderful soothing clinique laser repair
trying this mega-bright one

i don't like the scent-it smells nutty to me
my cheeks are bright red
i like the bouncy texture
i am in love with the sweet vanilla scent

had more of a healthy glow
the red glitter in the metallic mask was a surprise- i don't really want glitter
makes my face super flaky
i loved the texture
more like sparkly melted plastic with an acrid chemical smell
especially the calming oatmeal line
the scent isn't overpowering
create some weird cloudiness
and made my skin very shiny.
helped in brightening skin tone
when applied feels very sticky/tacky
it turned a dark orange color
the smell of these camu camu products
it gives me a bit of an orange cast
i also noticed a glow in skin tone.
the texture is a little odd
this creams texture is wonderful.
dark circles - no stars.
the black tea from fresh does nothing
it's a very nice creamy moisturizer that goes on beautifully
refreshing just like black tea
it smelled sour like actual sour milk
the scent starts out really pleasant
loved the whipped argan oil
love the original argan oil
tacky on my skin
because instead getting a creamy
my face was left feeling tacky from it
absorbs into the skin wonderfully
i used celestial by lush
it smells like black licorice
this is just a light milky oil that gives the surface of the skin that light oily glow look
it smells divine like coconuts.
i think its too fragrant or something.
the coconut smell was waay too strong.
taking off the mask was pleasant
i've enjoyed my origins mushroom mask better for a mostirizing mask
it is way to perfumed for me
it smells like an old waxy cream, also.
the caudalie cru original cream is a much nicer product
this product has a fairly strong perfumey scent which bothered my nose in bed
the beauty elixir smells funny.
not luxurious at all for the price
beautiful smell like the original
it just wasn't pleasant
"radiant" skin after using this product
make my skin feel silky smooth
the only plus was the smell (subtle roses).
is that it smells like roses
the scent is lovely
i think because of the rose flower extract
you will experience very foggy sight
i simply looked shiny
usually i only have to twirl it a little bit in a cup filled with warm water
and the perfume smell is way too strong in this.
light application and matte finish.
it felt silky on my skin, but that was about it.
it made my face satiny smooth
the smell was a bit overwhelming because i personally don't care for a floral scented cream on my face
the scent is too strong for a facial product
lotus youth radiance lotion is lightweight
the lotion has a very strong cucumber scent.
as for the cucumber smell
it smells a little like cucumbers
it smells exactly like a cucumber
i don't know that it really "illuminated" anything
the fragrance was kind of unpleasant
besides giving me a craving for lotus root
i love this fresh line
i will stick with the lotus moisturizer from fresh
s with a light smell
because it does give my skin a nice glow
the packaging is lovely
i found the cucumber-ish smell to be light
smells like a cucumber salad.
make the mask turn a dark green
it did turn from a light green to a dark green
my skin looked brighter
it turns from light green to dark green
the sun protection is great
makes my face look super shiny with makeup
this leaves my face shiny and feeling greasy.
i can't get past the chemical smell of lemon furniture polish
i didn't find that it improved my skin's radiance or gave it a brightening/luminous look at all
both time the area of skin i use on has turned bright red
it has pinkish color in it
the tint isn't enough tint
brought out the blue tones
i liked the brightening of the eyes
it has a salmon tint
i liked the peach tint
very dark purple circles under my eyes
this product has a good peach undertone to neutralize the colour of dark circles
a lovely metal dispenser that feels blissful on the eyes if refrigerated
sits in my delicate fine lines around the eye area
the medium tone is too pink for my olive asian skin tone
the color was way too pale
at 28 all i'm dealing with are darkish circles
the color is very pink.
needs a gentle touch with blending.
the tint help somewhat hide under eye dark areas
when looking in my mirror up close it looked cakey
the light one looked orange
the produce gave my eyes this strange shiny opalescent look that wasn't attractive
i loved the souffle-like consistency
i enjoyed using the product for the following reasons: it has a nice floral scent
i like the creamy/oily texture
i like the fresh scent
but besides that, this is a pleasant mask to use.
love the rose scent & the moisture it provides.
but even the lovely smell goes away fast.
it smells so nice, soothing.
i love the way it smells
this gel mask is a lovely
i love the very light rose scent
the green cucumber version works just as well
other than smelling good
i love the color pink
i do love the scent though!
the pink color still on my face
i switched to a gentle cleanser
it does a lovely job removing all makeup
it smells like medicine
i love rose scented anything
makes it seem almost creamy.
toes that one of the new shades will work for me because the glow this imparts is to die for
because even with the reviews saying this was a very pale shade
orange for my skin tone
refreshing on your skin
gave a nice dewy glow--i could never tell i was wearing it
the color is too orange for my skin tone
it was way to dark for my skin tone
looked strange on my skin.
it smells a little weird
l have olive skin with yellow undertones
this product made me look pink
looks super dull after application.
am thinking i should just return it because the color is way too dark/yellow for my alabaster pale skin
after a while i noticed it looked orangey
i finish with a translucent powder to set
i found another tinted moisturizer that is far superior
also, the color is orange on my fair skin .
it does make my skin "dewy"
one shade for all?
made my skin look dewy
the color is perfect
the new version leaves a chalky
while the shade is fine for my skin tone
the smell was disgusting
still look like a tomato
smells like orange juice
expected it to be tingly
my face turned bright red
i liked the eucalyptus smell
it made me skin bright red and burn so bad!
there is also rosa canina fruit oil
this oil has a very pleasant scent.
with this my skin is glowing in the morning

this is a fine eye creme
all the products smell kind of unpleasant.
her packaging is beautiful

i find it to be kind of unpleasant smelling
it feels amazing gliding on the skin
i love the scent of it

it sits on it looking very shiny
i don't notice that my eyes look instantly illuminated
i assumed it would smell like roses
my nose was super shiny
left a very frosty white shimmer behind
the am did brighten
how rich the cream was
to me it smells like rotting fruit
it smells like green apple and a musty wet cat.
the only way i can describe it is sour green apple mixed with
it's kind of similar to a green apple scent
i got this in the glam glow the magic box of sexy
i love the smell of this mask
nothing different from using my lush cleanser
the smell is very strong and pungent.
hoping the other glam glow muds perform better than this one
thirstymud masks from glam glow
there is a somewhat tingly sensation
definitely wouldn't recommend this mask out of all the glam glow products
it sort of tingles on the skin a bit
i did notice it was looking a lot more radiant
this glam glow purchase does not work for me.
this is my favourite of the glam glow masks!
witch hazel contains "tannins" which can be irritating if overused
the smell is really overpowering
kind of smells like yeast
while i think i saw s subtle glow return to my skin
smells lovely and leaves my skin smooth.
it has a lovely smell too.
the "firming" was comical
it smells like cucumber at first
the scent smells like seaweed
in the morning the skin under my eyes was a dark purple
found the cucumber smell unappealing
other than the delightful smell, it did nothing.
it was more bubbly than foamy.
it's milky, foams nicely, and cleans well.
smell reminds me of an old cigar.

it smells strongly on lemon halls
it is very scented.
my problem was the scent.
it has a strong perfume smell
it is wayyyyyy too perfumed to be recommended for nighttime/before bed use
the scent of this cream is what first comes to mind
strong fragrances tend to make my eyes burn
it feel very luxurious
that perfume from the 1990s sunflowers.
i've heard people describing the smell as fishy
to me this product smells like rotten avocados
i think it's been healing with brightness
make me crave barbecue potato chips
plain sweet almond oil
it's very hydrating but way too fragrant.
the smell is pine intense.
too strong perfume scent.
loving the magic from that cream
it smells so delicious
like a natural woodsy smell maybe
fine it's beautiful packaging
i much prefer the regular oak eye cream
the cream itself was underwhelming
hollows of my eyes more because of the fragrance
after activating with water it smells like musty multi-vitamins
chunky, smells metallic, no improvement to skin.
i liked the texture
while it does brighten the complexion
it's hard to find a treatment that provides that glow boost
smelled like a weird chemically oil
the scent lingers on your h

the texture is a very liquid milky white substance
this one smelled of flowers very strongly
the smell is too organic
veggieplant-ish vs a lovely perfume
the smell is overpowering
it is heavily scented
since it is cream like in texture
this mask is creamy
they were smoothing out thanks to tatcha indigo
the herbal scent was also a little strong
smells a little like vanilla or coconut.
the fragrance is quite powdery with a hint of freshness
first of all-it smells disgusting.
i like the scent
it reminds me of vanilla frosting
while i find this cleanser unique in its melting texture
thought that i'd like this indulgent-sounding cleanser
this eye cream comes in a weird texture that's between a cream
i give it 5 stars only for the scent
this one was gentle
it's a very perfumed mushroom scent.
when i saw someone said it was rose geranium
i loved the texture
make your surroundings appear to be in a cloud of smoke
if you are considering using it as i was sweet almond oil removes makeup better
i liked the scent
i gave the product 2 stars instead of 1 just for the lovely light orange smell
it also didn't feel luxurious, but was sticky.
even the creamiest cc eye care cream from sephora
without it looking cakey
was hoping on more vibrant skin.
it still hint of fish scent
reminded me of the smell of tea which is something i could live without smelling
it smells very sweet... i am returning it.
i love the smell and luxurious feel of this mask.
the smell is overpoweringly sweet

i love the glam glow mask
lotus oil is so much better
i like fragrances that are subtle
he product is lovely.
all of clarins other items smell lovely
have loved the smell
am so sad to have this gorgeous green bottle sitting on my bathroom counter
has a beautiful slip to it
the bummer is that with so many natural flower
it's very watery feeling.
the smell is a very strong lemongrass
god it made me nauseous
it has a nice light citrus smell
the fragrance is a bit overwhelming
it has a strong ginger smell
it does smell like orange sherbet
the scent is quite lovely though.
it felt like silk.
this moisturizer has a strong perfumey smell that i can't st
the scent was an overpowering perfume smell
lacks the lavender smell i love
it was so unflattering and weirdly texturized.
my skin looked dull
is light/refreshing around the eyes
stank horribly like old lady perfume
i love perfume, but the scents i choose.
after using either the camellia oil alone or followed by the classic powder
yummy fruity pebbles smell.
logo is beautiful with simple sophistication
i heard this was a magical oil that would help with acne scars
left it looking bright
i'd recommend smelling it before you buy
gives it a subtle glow which i like
this is a gentle facial bar
i agree it is gentle
this dry oil smells heavenly and feels luxurious.
once i started adding a drop or two with my mattifying primer my skin looks gorgeous
i liked the scent
would not call this fragrant either
neither my nose nor my skin liked the fragrance
it was really luxurious
it has a light fresh scent and it foams up well.
the product is very creamy
this product is very creamy
i also wished it was a creamy cleanser.
the smell is pleasant
although it is a gentle formula
want a cool looking de-puffer
it left a weirdly warm tingly feeling under my eyes
after i put it on i could feel the tingling refreshing sensation
it was semi-brightening
it does not leave the skin silky smooth
oddly shaped it's easy to poke your eye
the tarte eye cream is so much better.
the little iron is cute
it turns matte, with an almost powder finish.
the application is cool and refreshing.
there's some brightening from the mica
adorable packaging doesn't make up for overwhelming fragrance
it smells like overcooked bacon
i like the smell
the bottle is tall
texture when worn alone is nice
it has a pleasant rosy scent, which broke me out.
the scent was lovely
the featured "blend of optics" seem to be extremely tiny micro sparkles

the restoration of your glow
it has a pleasant-enough smell
left a weird tacky texture to it after taking it off
leaves a somewhat powdery film behind
this has a refreshing citrusy
slightly floral scent that fades to barely noticeable
it made my tarte bb cream streaky
the texture reminds me of an eye cream
dates just to get that goddess glow
i didn't even get this feeling of freshness
did not make it look more radiant
it left my skin glowing
i recommend glam glow face mask for any kind of issue
the golden stuff is cheap glitter
it's goopy like honey
sticking to glam glow thirsty mud.
face bright red for a couple hours after.
my cheeks were bright red
weird smell that lingers
stays bright red for a few hours
i am always on the hunt for a good glow product.
gave me perfect glow
the glow is worth the headache
short-lived glow to your skin
the moisture and glow don't last long.
peachy & fruity, without smelling like chemicals.
smells like the peach blossom doll
citrus scent of this face wash
i like the smell
gives you a glowing beautiful complexion.
also the synthetic peach scent isn't great.
i like the texture of this product
i love glam glow
got this in the glamglow gift sexy.
i wouldn't have purchased solely for the artificial perfumed smell

i might give it another shot or get a sample of another type of glam glow cleanser
the aqua colored one for hydration
i love glam glow
i noticed it smelled wonderful!
i love fresh products
your eyes look glowy.
i got the cream as part of the lotus set.

i love the lotus youth preserve face cream
didn't deliver on the dullness-to-radiance

i saw no brigthening effect or glow.
it does smell lovely though
le the natural scent

once i got a whiff of that smell again
plus the scent of it was not pleasant!
the strong smell of old-lady-sun-tan-lotion really turned me off
it has a baby powder super fragrant smell.
the product is gentle
had a strong, unpleasant almost chemically smell.
it is way too scented
it smelled like the shea
it smells like baby oil
almost has a plasticity smell.
not pleasant at all.
i smelled it all night
it also has a strong fragrance.
it should be called the divine irritating oil.
my skin felt tacky.
the scent is not pleasant at all
it also does not feel luxurious on skin .
alpa assured me that this only gave a glow
the face finishing moisturizer tint looks grey'ish
i like the glow the product gives my skin
want a glow with spf
pinker color than my own skin tone
the only problem i have with it is the tint.
it tinted my skin a funny color
the tint capsules that are supposed to produce a flattering glow merely turned my skin muddy
i didn't feel difference in texture or see a more radiant mewas just another moisturizer for me
it brightens it too
was the delectable scent
like a cross between a creme br√ªl√©e
it has a bit of a strange smell
it does have a rotten aroma when first applied.
then fades to a powdery smell
good lord the smell is unbearable
at first it smells like rotting chocolate
all day i was smelling cigar
the vanilla scent is divine ‚Äî two stars for the scent

i just hope algenist can change the smell of the product either no fragrant or citrusy kind of smell
faintly sweet like swampy algae rotting in the hot sun
it leaves a slightly tacky
my face was super shiny
left a sort of filmy feeling as opposed to a refreshing clean
the color changing effect is neat.
the forming and bubbly was interesting.
it's enjoyable to use since the bubbling sensation feels cool
tacky feeling on my face
it leaves a matt finish
when i saw the glow revival
my skin did glow
it says it is brightening
also, it says it gives bursts of radiance.
this plus the shimmer
the older one had more of an opal effect that gave your skin this inner glow when applied
turns out it's just like a tinted moisturizer
it has that shimmering texture which i hate
it like a sun screen
but...lovely packaging ill give it that
i like things with green tea
just needed some "glow
this smells like rotten milk
it claims to be gentle
to i could smell the fragrance in it
the scent however is addictive.
the texture is white and creamy .
it smells like old flowers that have been sitting in a vase too long
because the scent of it on your face is very overpowering
this smells absolutely delicious
smells like starburst or skittles.
the scent on this is brutal.
as it causes the foundation to sit in pores oddly
it has a pleasant lavender scent.
it is lavender scented
i love bobbi brown cosmetics
i like that it goes on more creamy
it leaves my skin shinier
it left me shiny
the original gave my skin a shine
the perfume smell is off-putting
the original version of hope dry skin was creamy
the smell is different
the texture is silky and the cream is thick.
the texture is very odd
the consistency is pretty creamy for how thick the balm is
i prefer the texture
i love fab face cream and cleaner.
cream with an added disgusting scent for authenticity
it does pair amazingly well with the moon fruit sleeping mask by herbivore
my face has a revolting green sheen
liked the smell (chamomile?)
the dissolving blue color was pretty neat.
leaving the truly pungent
chemically sweet scent sticking around for a solid five to ten minutes
it's very aesthetically pleasing to me
i didnt expect the oil to be a deep teal
i know it's kind of funky
the product descriptions says milky texture
it's more thick texture
makes them look bigger because of the blue tint
my skin is still the same didn't help with texture discoloration dullness or radiance
the scent was strong
love the smell for before bed, very relaxing.
the smell on these products is not pleasant.
kinda smells like dirt.
the scent is herbaceous
recovers from dull skin textures
give it some glow
the scent is really lovely
at times textured skin
it's a great sun screen on its own
lines wonderfully on its own
nstead of the smooth creamy application i'm used to
won't allow any creamy products to lie smoothly
while pale enough for me
this is perfumed to heck and back.
the texture is silky
this product has an odd smell
i'd love it if it wasn't scented stronger than most perfumes
but the fragrance is unbearable.
it's pungently sweet smelling
feels like a silky primer
bluring with good sun protection
it makes me very shiny
my face was very shiny
matte to natural finish foundation over top of this
my makeup looks so cakey
this has a very strong fragrant smell
it didnt de-puff, brighten or lift anything.
it also smells like eucalyptus
i decided not to return it because the scent is delicious
it's feels good because it's creamy
though it says its gentle
it's supposed to be natural and refreshing.
purchased this for its light scent
love the scent and it's very lightweight.
it isn't creamy at all, it's almost liquidy.
the scent is pleasant and unobtrusive.
i am shiny from the onset
it sits on top of your skin creating a weird fim layer
the scent lingers all day
the smell is great- smells just like fruity pebbles to me
it's more like a primer with a similar on-skin texture to smashbox's iconic primer
i like the texture of it
this mask is gentle
it does have a pleasant smell to it
radiant eye cream still continues
my dark circles are still dark purple
didnt realize it has a tint to it which i was excited to find out
this is quite shimmery
the shimmers can't really be seen under foundation
this is basically a shimmery moisturizer
not shimmery in a good
my face is shimmery all over like i am some sort of show dancer
the deal breaker for me is that its got tones of shimmer in it
the scent was okay
love the clean smell
it smelled odd, and was gritty.
smells lovely, and that's about it.
it's also very fragrant.
it's a thicker/creamier consistency with a light scent that isn't unpleasant
looked amazing underneath dior nude air powder
really gave my skin an "airbrushed" look
which doubles beautifully as a primer
also has a really strong floral sent that i don't care for
it also leaves a white hue
it has good sun protection
this leaves a horrible white cast
not velvety at all
i noticed a peppermint-like scent
it made me look gray
it's really thick and smells weird.
so forget darker skin tones
leaves me looking super white
nourishing power with high level uva
it feels lovely upon application
i like its texture
the fragrance is super strong
it smells like dirt and fake flower combination.
if you are sensitive to perfumy fake scents i would stay away
the bubbling effect is pretty novel
it left my face feeling tacky
my skin would be glowing in the morning
the baby powder fragrance added is nauseating
the scent is pleasant
the smell is pleasant though, very herbal.
smelled beautifully it seemed to flake off my skin almost like an exfoliating treatment
in sunlight, there's pink glitter everywhere!
the packaging is beautiful
the scent was pleasant
the fragrance is unpleasant.
the baby powder smell is really overwhelming
that strong baby powder+flowers fragrance
it reminded my of another mask by glam glow because it shows your pores
i love putting this mask on before bed i find the lavender smell to be relaxing
it had a creamy texture and it was white color.
the pinkish color is unique.
it is truly a cloying unpleasant smell
you would think with a name like flora
a floral scent would dominate
the smell is so overpowering
for an oil that is named "flora"
the smell is repulsive
my skin looks plump
the packaging is a nice and thick glass bottle.
the smell reminds me of seasoned oil that you dip your bread in
there's similar facial oils out there that have a better scent
appreciate the rose hip smell
between the two, i'd purchase juno over flora.
the best way i can describe the scent of flora is old crushed roses
first off,it smells nothing like roses.
although they have an organic/earthy smell
i loved the texture
a truly herbal smell that's very calming
this product leaves creamy residue on the face
it has a slightly gritty texture when it goes on that vanishes as it melts into the skin
it has a strong scent like the other divine products
the product is watery
first off the scent is disgusting
as an exfoliator it's too gentle
also, oddly, mine melted?
it definitely livened up my dull skin
it smells like a tacky woodsman
after smelling it for a bit
it smelled more like pine-sol to me
said it reminded her of patchouli
the tone was brighter
it smells like a slightly floral baby wipe.
it does give your face a glow
i smell pretty strong fragrant
it smells like a harsh chemical
and i do feel that it brightened my complexion.
the scent is okay
did not brighten my complexion
did not make my skin "luminous"
the formula feels lux
while i like how gentle the formula is
i liked the smell of the mask
isn't this mask all about making your face glow?
my complexion was very ruddy
the smell is funky, the texture scrapes my face.
my skin is really shiny all day.
it makes my skin shine
the color is pink
tone of the eye cream is nice
will brighten the undereye
i love the green tea
can't remember the flavor
i tried the orchid mask.
i used the green tea mask
sheet masks which work wonderfully
refreshing on the skin
i wish i could capture the scent as a perfume!
with a noticeable floral scent
it would be like smoke or something very musk-y
rinse easy breezy cleanser
it's not masculine, it's heavily perfumed.
it's like old grandma perfume, heavy and musky.
also--this does have a rather masculine scent which is a little weird for a facial product
it had an unpleasant bitter smell
it's gentle on the skin
it is quite fragrant
i love the texture of it
it is a rich eye cream
heavy oily product that didn't particularly smell pleasant
after use i notice a white cast to my face that looks a bit ghostly
i am all about brightening masks
products that give me "glow" which i didn't feel this mask gave me much of a glowing or brightening effect
i think it does create a sort of radiant glow
i think for brightening
it has a strong scent
it sort of smells like spoiled jasmine
the strong scent stung my skin
or "radiant" after the first application
the scent is so strong
this is an oil that smells
that product is lovely
this review is for lemongrass - radiance.
have the drops for radiance
it does have a scent
i got the radiance one
go for glam glow thirsty treatment mask
the texture was disappearing
it feels greasy and smells like sun screen.
got a headache from the overwhelming perfume scent
the texture of the creme is gooey
i got this because of the light texture.
had a slightly funky smell
it smells like alcohol
the texture of this is fascinating
a gel-like consistency that's a bit bouncy
bouncy gel like texture
i love the way it makes my face look dewy
it's a fun jello-like texture.
it remains tacky on the skin for a while
fragrance are very similar to the oh pure perfection
the invigorating night creme came up
the gel is so tacky
this eye creme smells so strongly like sushi!
made my eye area feel tacky
it smells like cucumbers
i gave it two stars because it smelled pleasant
i think it's a little too creamy
the fragrance is a light floral.
smell was a little alcohol-y
the texture is light
dark circles or tone at all
i like that this is a light cream that is gentle.
knock-off version of the l'occitane divine cream
the cream feels watery
i usually use l'occitane divine cream-
i loved the fragrance
on top of smelling like grass it made me breakout
it dies smell nice
it's like an herby
earthy smell of an apothecary
i like the texture of this cream.
i couldn't get past the flowery scent which smells kind of old-ladyish to me
sigh~~ where can i find my perfect moisturizer.
i liked the texture
the consistency of this product is very creamy if you're into that
the green and pink were both awesome.
my skin turned a pretty bright red
especially that green one
i dislike using creamy cleansers
i do love some of the tatcha products: camellia oil
especially when it also promises luminous skin.
i'll give it a 3 because it does give a nice glow to the face
including their radiant deep brightening serum
the consistency was very syrup-y
neck as a subtle perfume scent since i like the smell
i turned into a very shiny person
it smells powdery but kinda musty.
the smell is divine
this is a silky and smooth serum.
gave the two stars only for beautiful packaging
the smell is delicious
i instantly saw a brightness
however, the scent...no, make that the smell.
this isn't a too sweet or too floral or too clean scent
very strong perfume smell
the finely meteor dust was a great addition
scent was too overpowering
this cleanser smell so refreshing
oiliness decided to try this mask however the strong chemical smell is just unbearable to me
the smell is lovely.
it left a tacky 'filmy' feeling on my face.
the smell and texture is nice.
it was tacky and sticky.
it feels tacky when on
i prefer a luminous look.
there was an instant glow
just lovely, smooth, gorgeous skin.
just gorgeous, glowing skin.
why is a product like this gracing shelves at sephora??
i like the packaging with wooden style cap with nice glass like container
it has a very strong perfume-y smell
didnt really smell afloral citrus as described
did have a clay scent
it smells faintly of roses.
their packaging is gorgeous
luxurious when you apply
does not smell at all like blue tansy
it was a milky green colour.
the smell is mild
it was a brighter blue
smelled stronger of blue raspberry
the smell was more cardboardy
works nicely layered under a moisturizer.
this product has a heavy floral scent that i am sensitive to
the feel of it was luxurious
i loved the rose smell
the smell is intoxicating
thought i'd try the orchid oil because it's a little cheaper
found out that it just smells like jasmine
the facial oils smell nice
also it smells vile.
if the scent was less potent i would've loved it!
the blue has turned blue-green
might as well stick with the glow tonic
the ingredients sounded promising

took off stars because the serum feels tacky on the skin which is surprising since it's very viscous

it smells like bacon
this one was nauseating
i like the smell.
it smells like rotten oranges

gave my face a orange dark tan look.
like bad orange shade foundation.

i think this cleanser is a novelty- cool packaging
the smell is very perfumey
i like itthe scent is fine
intrigued by the mousse
otherwise good smell and cute packaging.

i love the texture of this eye cream.
smells like old lady perfume

i liked the texture
